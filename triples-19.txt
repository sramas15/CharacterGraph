ANTONIO
0
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
SALERIO
0
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
SOLANIO
0
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
SALERIO
0
My wind, cooling my broth,
ANTONIO
0
Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,
SOLANIO
0
Why then you are in love.
ANTONIO
0
Fie, fie!
SOLANIO
0
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
SALERIO
0
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
ANTONIO
0
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
SALERIO
0
Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO
0
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
SALERIO
0
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
LORENZO
0
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
BASSANIO
0
I will not fail you.
GRATIANO
0
You look not well, Signior Antonio;
ANTONIO
0
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
GRATIANO
0
Let me play the fool.
LORENZO
0
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
GRATIANO
0
Well, keep me company but two years moe,
ANTONIO
0
Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
GRATIANO
0
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
ANTONIO
0
Is that anything now?
BASSANIO
0
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
ANTONIO
0
Well; tell me now what lady is the same
BASSANIO
0
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
ANTONIO
0
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
BASSANIO
0
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
ANTONIO
0
You know me well, and herein spend but time
BASSANIO
0
In Belmont is a lady richly left,
ANTONIO
0
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
PORTIA
0
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
NERISSA
0
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
PORTIA
0
Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
NERISSA
0
They would be better, if well followed.
PORTIA
0
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
NERISSA
0
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
PORTIA
0
I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will
NERISSA
0
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
PORTIA
0
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
NERISSA
0
Then is there the County Palatine.
PORTIA
0
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will
NERISSA
0
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
PORTIA
0
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In
NERISSA
0
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
PORTIA
0
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,
NERISSA
0
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
PORTIA
0
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed
NERISSA
0
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
PORTIA
0
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
NERISSA
0
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
PORTIA
0
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep
NERISSA
0
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;
PORTIA
0
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
NERISSA
0
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
PORTIA
0
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call'd.
NERISSA
0
True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
PORTIA
0
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
SERVINGMAN
0
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their

0
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I
SHYLOCK
0
Three thousand ducats- well.
BASSANIO
0
Ay, sir, for three months.
SHYLOCK
0
For three months- well.
BASSANIO
0
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
SHYLOCK
0
Antonio shall become bound- well.
BASSANIO
0
May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your
SHYLOCK
0
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
BASSANIO
0
Your answer to that.
SHYLOCK
0
Antonio is a good man.
BASSANIO
0
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
SHYLOCK
0
Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man
BASSANIO
0
Be assur'd you may.
SHYLOCK
0
I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I
BASSANIO
0
If it please you to dine with us.
SHYLOCK
0
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your
BASSANIO
0
This is Signior Antonio.
SHYLOCK
0
 [Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
BASSANIO
0
Shylock, do you hear?
SHYLOCK
0
I am debating of my present store,
ANTONIO
0
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
SHYLOCK
0
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
ANTONIO
0
And for three months.
SHYLOCK
0
I had forgot- three months; you told me so.
ANTONIO
0
I do never use it.
SHYLOCK
0
When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-
ANTONIO
0
And what of him? Did he take interest?
SHYLOCK
0
No, not take interest; not, as you would say,
ANTONIO
0
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
SHYLOCK
0
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
ANTONIO
0
 [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
SHYLOCK
0
Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
ANTONIO
0
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
SHYLOCK
0
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
ANTONIO
0
I am as like to call thee so again,
SHYLOCK
0
Why, look you, how you storm!
BASSANIO
0
This were kindness.
SHYLOCK
0
This kindness will I show.
ANTONIO
0
Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
BASSANIO
0
You shall not seal to such a bond for me;
ANTONIO
0
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
SHYLOCK
0
O father Abram, what these Christians are,
ANTONIO
0
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
SHYLOCK
0
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
ANTONIO
0
Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
BASSANIO
0
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
ANTONIO
0
Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
PRINCE OF Morocco
0
Mislike me not for my complexion,
PORTIA
0
In terms of choice I am not solely led
PRINCE OF MOROCCO
0
Even for that I thank you.
PORTIA
0
You must take your chance,
PRINCE OF MOROCCO
0
Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
PORTIA
0
First, forward to the temple. After dinner
PRINCE OF MOROCCO
0
Good fortune then,
LAUNCELOT
0
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
GOBBO
0
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
LAUNCELOT
0
 [Aside]  O heavens! This is my true-begotten father,
GOBBO
0
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
LAUNCELOT
0
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at
GOBBO
0
Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell
LAUNCELOT
0
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me
GOBBO
0
No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
LAUNCELOT
0
Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
GOBBO
0
Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
LAUNCELOT
0
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
GOBBO
0
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
LAUNCELOT
0
Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
GOBBO
0
Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
LAUNCELOT
0
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
GOBBO
0
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
LAUNCELOT
0
Do you not know me, father?
GOBBO
0
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
LAUNCELOT
0
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
GOBBO
0
Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my
LAUNCELOT
0
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
GOBBO
0
I cannot think you are my son.
LAUNCELOT
0
I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
GOBBO
0
Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be
LAUNCELOT
0
It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward;
GOBBO
0
Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
LAUNCELOT
0
Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
BASSANIO
0
You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be
LAUNCELOT
0
To him, father.
GOBBO
0
God bless your worship!
BASSANIO
0
Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
GOBBO
0
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
LAUNCELOT
0
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
GOBBO
0
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
LAUNCELOT
0
Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
GOBBO
0
His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
LAUNCELOT
0
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done
GOBBO
0
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
LAUNCELOT
0
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
BASSANIO
0
One speak for both. What would you?
LAUNCELOT
0
Serve you, sir.
GOBBO
0
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
BASSANIO
0
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit.
LAUNCELOT
0
The old proverb is very well parted between my master
BASSANIO
0
Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
LAUNCELOT
0
Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
BASSANIO
0
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
LEONARDO
0
My best endeavours shall be done herein.
GRATIANO
0
Where's your master?
LEONARDO
0
Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit
GRATIANO
0
Signior Bassanio!
BASSANIO
0
Gratiano!
GRATIANO
0
I have suit to you.
BASSANIO
0
You have obtain'd it.
GRATIANO
0
You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
BASSANIO
0
Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano:
GRATIANO
0
Signior Bassanio, hear me:
BASSANIO
0
Well, we shall see your bearing.
GRATIANO
0
Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me
BASSANIO
0
No, that were pity;
GRATIANO
0
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
JESSICA
0
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
LAUNCELOT
0
Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan,
JESSICA
0
Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
0
Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
GRATIANO
0
We have not made good preparation.
SALERIO
0
We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
SOLANIO
0
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;
LORENZO
0
'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours
LAUNCELOT
0
An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem
LORENZO
0
I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
GRATIANO
0
Love-news, in faith!
LAUNCELOT
0
By your leave, sir.
LORENZO
0
Whither goest thou?
LAUNCELOT
0
Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup
LORENZO
0
Hold, here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica
SALERIO
0
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
SOLANIO
0
And so will I.
LORENZO
0
Meet me and Gratiano
SALERIO
0
'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
GRATIANO
0
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
LORENZO
0
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
SHYLOCK
0
Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,
LAUNCELOT
0
Why, Jessica!
SHYLOCK
0
Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
LAUNCELOT
0
Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing
JESSICA
0
Call you? What is your will?
SHYLOCK
0
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;
LAUNCELOT
0
I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your
SHYLOCK
0
So do I his.
LAUNCELOT
0
And they have conspired together; I will not say you
SHYLOCK
0
What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
LAUNCELOT
0
I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for
SHYLOCK
0
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
JESSICA
0
His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
SHYLOCK
0
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
JESSICA
0
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
GRATIANO
0
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
SALERIO
0
His hour is almost past.
GRATIANO
0
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
SALERIO
0
O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
GRATIANO
0
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
SALERIO
0
Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
LORENZO
0
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!
JESSICA
0
Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
LORENZO
0
Lorenzo, and thy love.
JESSICA
0
Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;
LORENZO
0
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
JESSICA
0
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
LORENZO
0
Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
JESSICA
0
What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
LORENZO
0
So are you, sweet,
JESSICA
0
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
GRATIANO
0
Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
LORENZO
0
Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
ANTONIO
0
Who's there?
GRATIANO
0
Signior Antonio?
ANTONIO
0
Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
GRATIANO
0
I am glad on't; I desire no more delight
PORTIA
0
Go draw aside the curtains and discover
PRINCE OF MOROCCO
0
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears:
PORTIA
0
The one of them contains my picture, Prince;
PRINCE OF MOROCCO
0
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
PORTIA
0
There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
PRINCE OF MOROCCO
0
O hell! what have we here?
PORTIA
0
A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
SALERIO
0
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;
SOLANIO
0
The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke,
SALERIO
0
He came too late, the ship was under sail;
SOLANIO
0
I never heard a passion so confus'd,
SALERIO
0
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
SOLANIO
0
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
SALERIO
0
Marry, well rememb'red;
SOLANIO
0
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
SALERIO
0
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
SOLANIO
0
I think he only loves the world for him.
SALERIO
0
Do we so.                                      Exeunt
NERISSA
0
Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;
PORTIA
0
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
ARRAGON
0
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
PORTIA
0
To these injunctions every one doth swear
ARRAGON
0
And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
PORTIA
0
 [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
ARRAGON
0
What's here? The portrait of a blinking idiot
PORTIA
0
To offend and judge are distinct offices
ARRAGON
0
What is here?  [Reads]
PORTIA
0
Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
NERISSA
0
The ancient saying is no heresy:
PORTIA
0
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
SERVANT
0
Where is my lady?
PORTIA
0
Here; what would my lord?
SERVANT
0
Madam, there is alighted at your gate
PORTIA
0
No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard
NERISSA
0
Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!        Exeunt
SOLANIO
0
Now, what news on the Rialto?
SALERIO
0
Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship
SOLANIO
0
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
SALERIO
0
Come, the full stop.
SOLANIO
0
Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a
SALERIO
0
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
SOLANIO
0
Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer,
SHYLOCK
0
You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my
SALERIO
0
That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
SOLANIO
0
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge;
SHYLOCK
0
She is damn'd for it.
SALERIO
0
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
SHYLOCK
0
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
SOLANIO
0
Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
SHYLOCK
0
I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
SALERIO
0
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
SHYLOCK
0
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal,
SALERIO
0
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his
SHYLOCK
0
To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will
MAN
0
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to
SALERIO
0
We have been up and down to seek him.
SOLANIO

Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be
SHYLOCK
0
How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my
TUBAL
0
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
SHYLOCK
0
Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me
TUBAL
0
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in
SHYLOCK
0
What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
TUBAL
0
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
SHYLOCK
0
I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?
TUBAL
0
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
SHYLOCK
0
I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!-
TUBAL
0
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
SHYLOCK
0
Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold
TUBAL
0
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to
SHYLOCK
0
I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture him; I
TUBAL
0
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter
SHYLOCK
0
Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my
TUBAL

But Antonio is certainly undone.
SHYLOCK
0
Nay, that's true; that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an
PORTIA
0
I pray you tarry; pause a day or two
BASSANIO
0
Let me choose;
PORTIA
0
Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
BASSANIO
0
None but that ugly treason of mistrust
PORTIA
0
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
BASSANIO
0
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
PORTIA
0
Well then, confess and live.
BASSANIO
0
'Confess' and 'love'
PORTIA
0
Away, then; I am lock'd in one of them.
ALL

          Ding, dong, bell.
BASSANIO
0
So may the outward shows be least themselves;
PORTIA
0
 [Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
BASSANIO
0
 [Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?
PORTIA
0
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
BASSANIO
0
Madam, you have bereft me of all words;
NERISSA

My lord and lady, it is now our time
GRATIANO
0
My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,
BASSANIO
0
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
GRATIANO
0
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
PORTIA
0
Is this true, Nerissa?
NERISSA
0
Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
BASSANIO
0
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
GRATIANO
0
Yes, faith, my lord.
BASSANIO
0
Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
GRATIANO
0
We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand
NERISSA
0
What, and stake down?
GRATIANO
0
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down-
BASSANIO
0
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
PORTIA
0
So do I, my lord;
LORENZO
0
I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
SALERIO
0
I did, my lord,
BASSANIO

Ere I ope his letter,
SALERIO
0
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
GRATIANO
0
Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.
SALERIO
0
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
PORTIA
0
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
BASSANIO
0
O sweet Portia,
SALERIO
0
Not one, my lord.
JESSICA
0
When I was with him, I have heard him swear
PORTIA
0
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
BASSANIO
0
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,

What sum owes he the Jew?
BASSANIO

For me, three thousand ducats.

What! no more?

I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond.
ANTONIO

I pray thee hear me speak.
SHYLOCK

I'll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak;

Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
JESSICA
0
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
LAUNCELOT
0
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
JESSICA
0
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my
LAUNCELOT
0
Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
JESSICA
0
I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a
LAUNCELOT
0
Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
JESSICA
0
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he
LORENZO
0
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you
JESSICA
0
Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are
LORENZO
0
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
LAUNCELOT
0
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
LORENZO
0
How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
LAUNCELOT
0
That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
LORENZO
0
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them
LAUNCELOT
0
That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
LORENZO
0
Will you cover, then, sir?
LAUNCELOT
0
Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
LORENZO
0
Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the
LAUNCELOT
0
For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,
LORENZO
0
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
JESSICA
0
Past all expressing. It is very meet
LORENZO
0
Even such a husband
JESSICA
0
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
LORENZO
0
I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
JESSICA
0
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
LORENZO
0
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
JESSICA
0
Well, I'll set you forth.                      Exeunt
DUKE OF VENICE
0
What, is Antonio here?
ANTONIO
0
Ready, so please your Grace.
DUKE OF VENICE
0
I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer
ANTONIO
0
I have heard
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
SALERIO
0
He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Make room, and let him stand before our face.
SHYLOCK
0
I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose,
BASSANIO
0
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
SHYLOCK
0
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
BASSANIO
0
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
SHYLOCK
0
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
BASSANIO
0
Every offence is not a hate at first.
SHYLOCK
0
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
ANTONIO
0
I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
BASSANIO
0
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
SHYLOCK
0
If every ducat in six thousand ducats
DUKE OF VENICE
0
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
SHYLOCK
0
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
SALERIO
0
My lord, here stays without
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
BASSANIO
0
Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
ANTONIO
0
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
NERISSA
0
From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.
BASSANIO
0
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
SHYLOCK
0
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
GRATIANO
0
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
SHYLOCK
0
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
GRATIANO
0
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
SHYLOCK
0
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
DUKE OF VENICE
0
This letter from Bellario doth commend
NERISSA
0
He attendeth here hard by
DUKE OF VENICE
0
With all my heart. Some three or four of you
CLERK
0
 [Reads]  'Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt
DUKE OF VENICE
0
YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes;
PORTIA
0
I did, my lord.
DUKE OF VENICE
0
You are welcome; take your place.
PORTIA
0
I am informed throughly of the cause.
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
PORTIA
0
Is your name Shylock?
SHYLOCK
0
Shylock is my name.
PORTIA
0
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
ANTONIO
0
Ay, so he says.
PORTIA
0
Do you confess the bond?
ANTONIO
0
I do.
PORTIA
0
Then must the Jew be merciful.
SHYLOCK
0
On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
PORTIA
0
The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
SHYLOCK
0
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
BASSANIO
0
Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;
PORTIA
0
It must not be; there is no power in Venice
SHYLOCK
0
A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!
PORTIA
0
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
SHYLOCK
0
Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
PORTIA
0
Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
SHYLOCK
0
An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.
PORTIA
0
Why, this bond is forfeit;
SHYLOCK
0
When it is paid according to the tenour.
ANTONIO
0
Most heartily I do beseech the court
PORTIA
0
Why then, thus it is:
SHYLOCK
0
O noble judge! O excellent young man!
PORTIA
0
For the intent and purpose of the law
SHYLOCK
0
'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,
PORTIA
0
Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
SHYLOCK
0
Ay, his breast-
PORTIA
0
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
SHYLOCK
0
I have them ready.
PORTIA
0
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
SHYLOCK
0
Is it so nominated in the bond?
PORTIA
0
It is not so express'd, but what of that?
SHYLOCK
0
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
PORTIA
0
You, merchant, have you anything to say?
ANTONIO
0
But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
BASSANIO
0
Antonio, I am married to a wife
PORTIA
0
Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
GRATIANO
0
I have a wife who I protest I love;
NERISSA
0
'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
SHYLOCK
0
 [Aside]  These be the Christian husbands! I have a
PORTIA
0
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
SHYLOCK
0
Most rightful judge!
PORTIA
0
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
SHYLOCK
0
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
PORTIA
0
Tarry a little; there is something else.
GRATIANO
0
O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
SHYLOCK
0
Is that the law?
PORTIA
0
Thyself shalt see the act;
GRATIANO
0
O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!
SHYLOCK
0
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
BASSANIO
0
Here is the money.
PORTIA
0
Soft!
GRATIANO
0
O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
PORTIA
0
Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
GRATIANO
0
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
PORTIA
0
Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
SHYLOCK
0
Give me my principal, and let me go.
BASSANIO
0
I have it ready for thee; here it is.
PORTIA
0
He hath refus'd it in the open court;
GRATIANO
0
A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
SHYLOCK
0
Shall I not have barely my principal?
PORTIA
0
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
SHYLOCK
0
Why, then the devil give him good of it!
PORTIA
0
Tarry, Jew.
GRATIANO
0
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;
DUKE OF VENICE
0
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
PORTIA
0
Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
SHYLOCK
0
Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
PORTIA
0
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
GRATIANO
0
A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
ANTONIO
0
So please my lord the Duke and all the court
DUKE OF VENICE
0
He shall do this, or else I do recant
PORTIA
0
Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
SHYLOCK
0
I am content.
PORTIA
0
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
SHYLOCK
0
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Get thee gone, but do it.
GRATIANO
0
In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;
DUKE OF VENICE
0
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
PORTIA
0
I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;
DUKE OF VENICE
0
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
BASSANIO
0
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
ANTONIO
0
And stand indebted, over and above,
PORTIA
0
He is well paid that is well satisfied,
BASSANIO
0
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;
PORTIA
0
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
BASSANIO
0
This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
PORTIA
0
I will have nothing else but only this;
BASSANIO
0
 There's more depends on this than on the value.
PORTIA
0
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;
BASSANIO
0
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
PORTIA
0
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
ANTONIO
0
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
BASSANIO
0
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
PORTIA
0
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,
GRATIANO
0
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
PORTIA
0
That cannot be.
GRATIANO
0
That will I do.
NERISSA
0
Sir, I would speak with you.
PORTIA
0
 [To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant. We shall have old
NERISSA
0
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
LORENZO
0
The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
JESSICA
0
In such a night
LORENZO
0
In such a night
JESSICA
0
In such a night
JESSICA
0
In such a night
LORENZO
0
In such a night
JESSICA
0
I would out-night you, did no body come;
LORENZO
0
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
STEPHANO
0
A friend.
LORENZO
0
A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
STEPHANO
0
Stephano is my name, and I bring word
LORENZO
0
Who comes with her?
STEPHANO
0
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
LORENZO
0
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
LAUNCELOT
0
Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
LORENZO
0
Who calls?
LAUNCELOT
0
Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola,
LORENZO
0
Leave holloaing, man. Here!
LAUNCELOT
0
Sola! Where, where?
LORENZO
0
Here!
LAUNCELOT
0
Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
LORENZO
0
Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
JESSICA
0
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
LORENZO
0
The reason is your spirits are attentive;
PORTIA
0
That light we see is burning in my hall.
NERISSA
0
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
PORTIA
0
So doth the greater glory dim the less:
NERISSA
0
It is your music, madam, of the house.
PORTIA
0
Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
NERISSA
0
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
PORTIA
0
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
LORENZO
0
That is the voice,
PORTIA
0
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
LORENZO
0
Dear lady, welcome home.
PORTIA
0
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
LORENZO
0
Madam, they are not yet;
PORTIA
0
 Go in, Nerissa;
LORENZO
0
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.
PORTIA
0
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
BASSANIO
0
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
PORTIA
0
Let me give light, but let me not be light,
BASSANIO
0
I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.
PORTIA
0
You should in all sense be much bound to him,
ANTONIO
0
No more than I am well acquitted of.
PORTIA
0
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
GRATIANO
0
 [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
PORTIA
0
A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
GRATIANO
0
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
NERISSA
0
What talk you of the posy or the value?
GRATIANO
0
He will, an if he live to be a man.
NERISSA
0
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
GRATIANO
0
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,
PORTIA
0
You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
BASSANIO
0
 [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
GRATIANO
0
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
PORTIA
0
What ring gave you, my lord?
BASSANIO
0
If I could add a lie unto a fault,
PORTIA
0
Even so void is your false heart of truth;
NERISSA
0
Nor I in yours
BASSANIO
0
Sweet Portia,
PORTIA
0
If you had known the virtue of the ring,
BASSANIO
0
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
PORTIA
0
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;
NERISSA
0
And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
GRATIANO
0
Well, do you so, let not me take him then;
ANTONIO
0
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
PORTIA
0
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
BASSANIO
0
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
PORTIA
0
Mark you but that!
BASSANIO
0
Nay, but hear me.
ANTONIO
0
I once did lend my body for his wealth,
PORTIA
0
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
ANTONIO
0
Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
BASSANIO
0
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
PORTIA
0
I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
NERISSA
0
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
GRATIANO
0
Why, this is like the mending of highways
PORTIA
0
Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz'd.
ANTONIO
0
I am dumb.
BASSANIO
0
Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
GRATIANO
0
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
NERISSA
0
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
BASSANIO
0
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;
ANTONIO
0
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
PORTIA
0
How now, Lorenzo!
NERISSA
0
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
LORENZO
0
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
PORTIA
0
It is almost morning,
GRATIANO
0
Let it be so. The first inter'gatory
