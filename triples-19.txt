ANTONIO
LANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
    Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy
    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
    Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
    Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time:
    Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,
    And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;
    And other of such vinegar aspect
    That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
    Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

2
OLD GOBBO
LAUNCELOT GOBBO
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
    'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
    'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
    counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.

    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare

    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.
    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Well, if
    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.

    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me
    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the
    instruction.

  LAUNCELOT. 
1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-

LAUNCELOT

1
LAUNCELOT
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a

1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
    before, e'en as many as could well live one by another. This
    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all
    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the

    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we
    turn'd o'er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion
    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I
    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill
    up your Grace's request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,
    for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him

LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood-
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
    'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
    'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
    counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.

    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
    fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew, if I

    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.
    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Well, if
    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.

    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me
    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the

LAUNCELOT

LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow

    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we
    turn'd o'er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion
    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I
    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill
    up your Grace's request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,

    And yet no matter- why should we go in?
    My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,

    My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,

    And bring your music forth into the air.       Exit STEPHANO
    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls,
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
  JESSICA.

LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
SSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
  LORENZO. 
3
LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood-
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
RTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
4
LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
ATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
  NERISSA.

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
RISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?
  GRATIANO.

BASSANIO
LORENZO

PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
RTIA. What ring gave you, my lord?
  BASSANIO.

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
SSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault,

LAUNCELOT

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
SSANIO. Sweet Portia,

PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
RTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring,

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
BASSANIO
LORENZO
SSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,

ANTONIO
LANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
    Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy
    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
    Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
    Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time:
    Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,

    That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
    Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
    'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
    'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
    counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.

LAUNCELOT

2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me

LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,

BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
    fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew, if I
    serve the Jew any longer.

GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,

GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-

LAUNCELOT

BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and

2
GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
    tongue in my head!  [Looking on his palm]  Well; if any man in
    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.
    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Well, if
    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.

INCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
    A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
    There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
         'All that glisters is not gold,
         Often have you heard that told;
         Many a man his life hath sold
         But my outside to behold.
         Gilded tombs do worms infold.
         Had you been as wise as bold,
         Young in limbs, in judgment old,
         Your answer had not been inscroll'd.
         Fare you well, your suit is cold.'
      Cold indeed, and labour lost,
      Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.
    Portia, adieu! I have too griev'd a heart

YLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will

    million; laugh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my
    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me
    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the
    instruction.

    of Rome- his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause
    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we
    turn'd o'er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion
    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I
    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill
    up your Grace's request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,

    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls,
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood-
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
BASSANIO

2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
    'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
    'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
    counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.

  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Do you not know me, father?
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. I cannot think you are my son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward;
  GOBBO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BBO. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
  LAUNCELOT. 
3
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
    fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew, if I
    serve the Jew any longer.
  BASSANIO.

LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-

3
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
  GOBBO. 
3
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT.

LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  GOBBO.

GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
  LAUNCELOT.

2
GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
    tongue in my head!  [Looking on his palm]  Well; if any man in
    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.
    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Well, if
    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.

YLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will

    million; laugh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my
    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me
    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the
    instruction.

    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night

    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls,
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;

3
LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood-
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

BASSANIO
ANTONIO
LANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
    Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy
    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
    Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
    Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time:
    Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,
    And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;
    And other of such vinegar aspect
    That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
    Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

RISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?

UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this

2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
    'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
    'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
    counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.

LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,

BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
    fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew, if I
    serve the Jew any longer.

GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
  GOBBO.

GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT.

LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  GOBBO.

LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
  LAUNCELOT.

BASSANIO
UNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done
  GOBBO.

GOBBO
BASSANIO
BBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your

3
LAUNCELOT

LAUNCELOT

    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.

    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine

    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me

  LAUNCELOT. 
1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
  JESSICA.

LAUNCELOT
SSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my

1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and

1
LAUNCELOT
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a

LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow

2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
    before, e'en as many as could well live one by another. This
    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all
    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the

    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we
    turn'd o'er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion
    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I
    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill
    up your Grace's request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,
    for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him

    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night

    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls,
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood-
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

2
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
    to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
    'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
    My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
    honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
    run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
    fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
    'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
    heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
    an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
    kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
    'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
    counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
    will run.

    My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I
    am famish'd in his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to
    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I
    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare

    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I
    shall have good fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life;
    here's a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is nothing;
    a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man.
    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Well, if
    Fortune be a woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.

ATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
    With that keen appetite that he sits down?
    Where is the horse that doth untread again
    His tedious measures with the unbated fire
    That he did pace them first? All things that are
    Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.
    How like a younker or a prodigal
    The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
    Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind;
    How like the prodigal doth she return,
    With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
    Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

    million; laugh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my
    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me
    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the
    instruction.

1
LAUNCELOT
  LAUNCELOT. 
1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
  JESSICA. 
1
LAUNCELOT
SSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?
  LAUNCELOT. 
1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
  JESSICA. 
1
LAUNCELOT
SSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my
  LAUNCELOT. 
1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
  JESSICA. 
1
LAUNCELOT
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a
  LAUNCELOT. 
1
LAUNCELOT
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
    before, e'en as many as could well live one by another. This
    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all
    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the
    coals for money.
  JESSICA. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
SSICA. I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you
  JESSICA. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
SSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the
  LAUNCELOT. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
UNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
  JESSICA. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
SSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. Even such a husband
  JESSICA. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
SSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
  JESSICA. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
SSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
  LORENZO. 
2
LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
  JESSICA.

    messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor
    of Rome- his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause
    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we
    turn'd o'er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion
    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I
    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill
    up your Grace's request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation,
    for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him

    And yet no matter- why should we go in?

    Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
    And bring your music forth into the air.       Exit STEPHANO

RENZO. Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
    And yet no matter- why should we go in?
    My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
    Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
    And bring your music forth into the air.       Exit STEPHANO
    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls,
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
  JESSICA.

LAUNCELOT
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
  LORENZO.

LAUNCELOT
PORTIA
LORENZO
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood-
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

UNCELOT. Do you not know me, father?
  GOBBO.

  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the

BBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my

0
UNCELOT. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I cannot think you are my son.
  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
  GOBBO.

BBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be

UNCELOT. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward;

BBO. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
  LAUNCELOT.

SSANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Serve you, sir.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. The old proverb is very well parted between my master
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a

0
SSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. Where's your master?
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have suit to you.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You have obtain'd it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano:
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me:
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, that were pity;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan,
  JESSICA.

SSICA. Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. We have not made good preparation.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
  SOLANIO.

LANIO. 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;

0
RENZO. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours

UNCELOT. An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Love-news, in faith!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. By your leave, sir.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Whither goest thou?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Hold, here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And so will I.
  LORENZO.

RENZO. Meet me and Gratiano

LERIO. 'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Why, Jessica!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Call you? What is your will?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. So do I his.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. And they have conspired together; I will not say you
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. His hour is almost past.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
  SALERIO.

LERIO. O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. So are you, sweet,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Who's there?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Antonio?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I am glad on't; I desire no more delight
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Go draw aside the curtains and discover
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince;
  PRINCE

INCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;

0
RTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,

INCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He came too late, the ship was under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I never heard a passion so confus'd,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Marry, well rememb'red;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I think he only loves the world for him.
  SALERIO.

LERIO. Do we so.                                      Exeunt

RISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;

RAGON. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:

RTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear
  ARRAGON.

RAGON. And so have I address'd me. Fortune now

RTIA.  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
  ARRAGON.

  ARRAGON.

RAGON. What is here?  [Reads]
  PORTIA.

LANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto?
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship
  SOLANIO.

LANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Come, the full stop.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a

0
LERIO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. She is damn'd for it.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!
  SOLANIO.

LANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his
  SHYLOCK.

YLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will

0
N. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to

LERIO. We have been up and down to seek him.
  SOLANIO.

LANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!-
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
  SHYLOCK.

YLOCK. Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold

BAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter

YLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my

SSANIO. Let me choose;

RTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
  PORTIA.

RTIA. Well then, confess and live.

ATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.

RISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?
  PORTIA.

RTIA. Fie, what a question's that,
  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a
  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
  JESSICA.

SSICA. I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he

SSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are
  LORENZO.

RENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
  LORENZO.

RENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them
  LAUNCELOT.

UNCELOT. That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the

UNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,

RENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited!

SSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet

YLOCK. I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
  BASSANIO.

SSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.

TONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
  DUKE

KE OF VENICE. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

KE OF VENICE. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
  CLERK. 
0
ERK.  [Reads]  'Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I did, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. You are welcome; take your place.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is your name Shylock?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shylock is my name.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ay, so he says.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Do you confess the bond?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It must not be; there is no power in Venice
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why then, thus it is:
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. 'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, his breast-
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have them ready.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is not so express'd, but what of that?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  These be the Christian husbands! I have a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most rightful judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry a little; there is something else.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is that the law?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thyself shalt see the act;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Here is the money.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Soft!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I have it ready for thee; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry, Jew.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. He shall do this, or else I do recant
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am content.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Get thee gone, but do it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I will have nothing else but only this;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That cannot be.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That will I do.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Sir, I would speak with you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant. We shall have old
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I would out-night you, did no body come;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. A friend.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes with her?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who calls?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Where, where?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. That is the voice,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Madam, they are not yet;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.  [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He will, an if he live to be a man.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO.  [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What ring gave you, my lord?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Nor I in yours
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet Portia,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, do you so, let not me take him then;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Mark you but that!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Nay, but hear me.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz'd.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am dumb.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. How now, Lorenzo!
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way

LERIO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean;

0
LANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. My wind, cooling my broth,
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Why then you are in love.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie!
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  SALERIO.

LERIO. Good morrow, my good lords.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I will not fail you.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Let me play the fool.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Is that anything now?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the same
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. They would be better, if well followed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call'd.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. For three months- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Antonio shall become bound- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Your answer to that.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Antonio is a good man.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Be assur'd you may.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I

0
SSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This is Signior Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Shylock, do you hear?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am debating of my present store,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And for three months.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I had forgot- three months; you told me so.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do never use it.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. No, not take interest; not, as you would say,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, look you, how you storm!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This were kindness.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. This kindness will I show.
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF Morocco. Mislike me not for my complexion,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You must take your chance,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. First, forward to the temple. After dinner
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Good fortune then,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT.  [Aside]  O heavens! This is my true-begotten father,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Do you not know me, father?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I cannot think you are my son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward;
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To him, father.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. God bless your worship!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Serve you, sir.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. The old proverb is very well parted between my master
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Where's your master?
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have suit to you.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You have obtain'd it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano:
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me:
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, that were pity;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. We have not made good preparation.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Love-news, in faith!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. By your leave, sir.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Whither goest thou?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Hold, here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And so will I.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Meet me and Gratiano
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. 'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Why, Jessica!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Call you? What is your will?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. So do I his.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. And they have conspired together; I will not say you
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. His hour is almost past.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. So are you, sweet,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Who's there?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Antonio?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I am glad on't; I desire no more delight
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Go draw aside the curtains and discover
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He came too late, the ship was under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I never heard a passion so confus'd,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Marry, well rememb'red;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I think he only loves the world for him.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Do we so.                                      Exeunt
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. What's here? The portrait of a blinking idiot
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. To offend and judge are distinct offices
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. What is here?  [Reads]
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. The ancient saying is no heresy:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Where is my lady?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Here; what would my lord?
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Madam, there is alighted at your gate
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard
  NERISSA.

RISSA. Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!        Exeunt
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto?
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Come, the full stop.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. She is damn'd for it.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will
  MAN. 
0
N. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We have been up and down to seek him.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!-
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture him; I
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. But Antonio is certainly undone.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Nay, that's true; that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray you tarry; pause a day or two
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Let me choose;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Well then, confess and live.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. 'Confess' and 'love'
  PORTIA.

SSANIO.  [Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,

SSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words;
  NERISSA.

RISSA. My lord and lady, it is now our time
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,

SSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
  PORTIA.

RTIA. Is this true, Nerissa?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand

0
RISSA. What, and stake down?
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down-
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. So do I, my lord;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I did, my lord,
  BASSANIO.

SSANIO. Ere I ope his letter,
  SALERIO.

LERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. O sweet Portia,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Not one, my lord.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. When I was with him, I have heard him swear
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,

RTIA. What sum owes he the Jew?
  BASSANIO.

SSANIO. For me, three thousand ducats.

TONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.
  SHYLOCK.

TONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;

RENZO. Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I never did repent for doing good,
  LORENZO.

RENZO. Madam, with all my heart
  PORTIA.

0
RENZO. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Shall they see us?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Fie, what a question's that,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he

RENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Even such a husband
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Well, I'll set you forth.                      Exeunt
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. What, is Antonio here?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I have heard
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Make room, and let him stand before our face.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. My lord, here stays without
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. This letter from Bellario doth commend
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. He attendeth here hard by
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
  CLERK. 
0
ERK.  [Reads]  'Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I did, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. You are welcome; take your place.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is your name Shylock?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shylock is my name.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ay, so he says.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Do you confess the bond?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It must not be; there is no power in Venice
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why then, thus it is:
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. 'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, his breast-
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have them ready.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is not so express'd, but what of that?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  These be the Christian husbands! I have a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most rightful judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry a little; there is something else.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is that the law?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thyself shalt see the act;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Here is the money.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Soft!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I have it ready for thee; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry, Jew.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. He shall do this, or else I do recant
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am content.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Get thee gone, but do it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I will have nothing else but only this;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That cannot be.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That will I do.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Sir, I would speak with you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant. We shall have old
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I would out-night you, did no body come;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. A friend.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes with her?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who calls?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Where, where?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. That is the voice,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Madam, they are not yet;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.  [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He will, an if he live to be a man.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO.  [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What ring gave you, my lord?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Nor I in yours
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet Portia,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, do you so, let not me take him then;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Mark you but that!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Nay, but hear me.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz'd.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am dumb.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. How now, Lorenzo!
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way

LANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,

LERIO. My wind, cooling my broth,
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,
  SOLANIO.

LANIO. Why then you are in love.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie!
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
  SALERIO.

LERIO. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,

  BASSANIO.

SSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
  SALERIO.

LERIO. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I will not fail you.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Let me play the fool.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Is that anything now?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the same
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. They would be better, if well followed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call'd.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. For three months- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Antonio shall become bound- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Your answer to that.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Antonio is a good man.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Be assur'd you may.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This is Signior Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Shylock, do you hear?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am debating of my present store,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And for three months.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I had forgot- three months; you told me so.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do never use it.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. No, not take interest; not, as you would say,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, look you, how you storm!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This were kindness.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. This kindness will I show.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF Morocco. Mislike me not for my complexion,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You must take your chance,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. First, forward to the temple. After dinner
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Good fortune then,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT.  [Aside]  O heavens! This is my true-begotten father,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Do you not know me, father?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I cannot think you are my son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward;
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To him, father.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. God bless your worship!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Serve you, sir.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. The old proverb is very well parted between my master
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Where's your master?
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have suit to you.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You have obtain'd it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano:
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me:
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, that were pity;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. We have not made good preparation.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Love-news, in faith!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. By your leave, sir.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Whither goest thou?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Hold, here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And so will I.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Meet me and Gratiano
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. 'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Why, Jessica!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Call you? What is your will?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. So do I his.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. And they have conspired together; I will not say you
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. His hour is almost past.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. So are you, sweet,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Who's there?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Antonio?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I am glad on't; I desire no more delight
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Go draw aside the curtains and discover
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He came too late, the ship was under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I never heard a passion so confus'd,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Marry, well rememb'red;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I think he only loves the world for him.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Do we so.                                      Exeunt
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. What's here? The portrait of a blinking idiot
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. To offend and judge are distinct offices
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. What is here?  [Reads]
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. The ancient saying is no heresy:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Where is my lady?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Here; what would my lord?
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Madam, there is alighted at your gate
  PORTIA.

RTIA. No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard
  NERISSA.

RISSA. Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!        Exeunt
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto?
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Come, the full stop.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. She is damn'd for it.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will
  MAN. 
0
N. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We have been up and down to seek him.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!-
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture him; I
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. But Antonio is certainly undone.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Nay, that's true; that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray you tarry; pause a day or two
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Let me choose;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Well then, confess and live.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. 'Confess' and 'love'
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Away, then; I am lock'd in one of them.
  ALL.

SSANIO.  [Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words;
  NERISSA.

RISSA. My lord and lady, it is now our time
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,

SSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is this true, Nerissa?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand

0
RISSA. What, and stake down?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down-
  BASSANIO.

SSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. So do I, my lord;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I did, my lord,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Ere I ope his letter,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. O sweet Portia,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Not one, my lord.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. When I was with him, I have heard him swear
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What sum owes he the Jew?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For me, three thousand ducats.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What! no more?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO.  [Reads]  'Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I'll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. It is the most impenetrable cur
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Let him alone;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I am sure the Duke
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I never did repent for doing good,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Madam, with all my heart
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. My people do already know my mind,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
  BALTHASAR. 
0
LTHASAR. Madam, I go with all convenient speed.         Exit
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Shall they see us?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Fie, what a question's that,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Even such a husband
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Well, I'll set you forth.                      Exeunt
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. What, is Antonio here?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I have heard
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Make room, and let him stand before our face.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. My lord, here stays without
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. This letter from Bellario doth commend
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. He attendeth here hard by
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
  CLERK. 
0
ERK.  [Reads]  'Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I did, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. You are welcome; take your place.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is your name Shylock?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shylock is my name.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ay, so he says.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Do you confess the bond?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It must not be; there is no power in Venice
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why then, thus it is:
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. 'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, his breast-
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have them ready.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is not so express'd, but what of that?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  These be the Christian husbands! I have a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most rightful judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry a little; there is something else.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is that the law?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thyself shalt see the act;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Here is the money.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Soft!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I have it ready for thee; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry, Jew.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. He shall do this, or else I do recant
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am content.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Get thee gone, but do it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I will have nothing else but only this;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That cannot be.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That will I do.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Sir, I would speak with you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant. We shall have old
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. In such a night
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I would out-night you, did no body come;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. A friend.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes with her?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who calls?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Where, where?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. That is the voice,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Madam, they are not yet;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.  [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He will, an if he live to be a man.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO.  [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What ring gave you, my lord?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Nor I in yours
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet Portia,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, do you so, let not me take him then;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Mark you but that!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Nay, but hear me.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz'd.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am dumb.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. How now, Lorenzo!
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
  LORENZO.

  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. My wind, cooling my broth,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Why then you are in love.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie!
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Good morrow, my good lords.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I will not fail you.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Let me play the fool.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Is that anything now?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the same
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. They would be better, if well followed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call'd.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. For three months- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Antonio shall become bound- well.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Your answer to that.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Antonio is a good man.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Be assur'd you may.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This is Signior Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Shylock, do you hear?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am debating of my present store,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And for three months.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I had forgot- three months; you told me so.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do never use it.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. No, not take interest; not, as you would say,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, look you, how you storm!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This were kindness.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. This kindness will I show.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF Morocco. Mislike me not for my complexion,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You must take your chance,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. First, forward to the temple. After dinner
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Good fortune then,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT.  [Aside]  O heavens! This is my true-begotten father,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark me
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Do you not know me, father?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I cannot think you are my son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward;
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To him, father.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. God bless your worship!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would,
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Serve you, sir.
  GOBBO. 
0
BBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. The old proverb is very well parted between my master
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne'er a
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Where's your master?
  LEONARDO. 
0
ONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Gratiano!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have suit to you.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. You have obtain'd it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano:
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me:
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, that were pity;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. We have not made good preparation.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Love-news, in faith!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. By your leave, sir.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Whither goest thou?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Hold, here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And so will I.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Meet me and Gratiano
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. 'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Why, Jessica!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Call you? What is your will?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. So do I his.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. And they have conspired together; I will not say you
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. His hour is almost past.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. So are you, sweet,
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Who's there?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Signior Antonio?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I am glad on't; I desire no more delight
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Go draw aside the curtains and discover
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He came too late, the ship was under sail;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I never heard a passion so confus'd,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Marry, well rememb'red;
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I think he only loves the world for him.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Do we so.                                      Exeunt
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. What's here? The portrait of a blinking idiot
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. To offend and judge are distinct offices
  ARRAGON. 
0
RAGON. What is here?  [Reads]
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. The ancient saying is no heresy:
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Where is my lady?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Here; what would my lord?
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Madam, there is alighted at your gate
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!        Exeunt
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto?
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Come, the full stop.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. She is damn'd for it.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!
  SOLANIO. 
0
LANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal,
  SALERIO.

N. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to

LERIO. We have been up and down to seek him.

LANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be

0
YLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!-
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold
  TUBAL. 
0
BAL. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture him; I

0
BAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my

0
BAL. But Antonio is certainly undone.
  SHYLOCK.

YLOCK. Nay, that's true; that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an

SSANIO. Let me choose;

RTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Well then, confess and live.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. 'Confess' and 'love'

  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,

SSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words;
  NERISSA.

ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,

0
SSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is this true, Nerissa?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.
  BASSANIO.

LERIO. I did, my lord,
  BASSANIO.

SSANIO. Ere I ope his letter,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. O sweet Portia,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. Not one, my lord.
  JESSICA.

0
RTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
  BASSANIO.

RTIA. What sum owes he the Jew?
  BASSANIO.

TONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.
  SHYLOCK.

  LORENZO.

RENZO. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Shall they see us?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Fie, what a question's that,
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not-
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I shall be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow

SSICA. I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he

RENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you

SSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Even such a husband

0
SSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
  LORENZO.

RENZO. No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;

KE OF VENICE. What, is Antonio here?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I have heard
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Make room, and let him stand before our face.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
  SALERIO. 
0
LERIO. My lord, here stays without
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
  DUKE

KE OF VENICE. This letter from Bellario doth commend
  NERISSA.

RISSA. He attendeth here hard by

RTIA. I did, my lord.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. You are welcome; take your place.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause.
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is your name Shylock?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shylock is my name.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ay, so he says.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Do you confess the bond?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I do.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It must not be; there is no power in Venice
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why then, thus it is:
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. 'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Ay, his breast-
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I have them ready.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. It is not so express'd, but what of that?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love;
  NERISSA.

RISSA. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK.  [Aside]  These be the Christian husbands! I have a
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most rightful judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry a little; there is something else.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Is that the law?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thyself shalt see the act;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Here is the money.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Soft!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I have it ready for thee; here it is.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Tarry, Jew.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
  DUKE

KE OF VENICE. He shall do this, or else I do recant
  PORTIA.

RTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I am content.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
  SHYLOCK. 
0
YLOCK. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Get thee gone, but do it.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;
  DUKE 
0
KE OF VENICE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I will have nothing else but only this;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That cannot be.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. That will I do.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Sir, I would speak with you.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA.  [To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant. We shall have old
  NERISSA.

RISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA.

SSICA. In such a night

0
RENZO. In such a night
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I would out-night you, did no body come;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. A friend.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who comes with her?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Who calls?
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Sola! Where, where?
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Here!
  LAUNCELOT. 
0
UNCELOT. Tell him there's a post come from my master with his
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
  JESSICA. 
0
SSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less:
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. That is the voice,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Madam, they are not yet;
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO.  [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;

ATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He will, an if he live to be a man.
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO.  [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. What ring gave you, my lord?
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Nor I in yours
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet Portia,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house;
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Well, do you so, let not me take him then;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Mark you but that!
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Nay, but hear me.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz'd.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am dumb.
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
  BASSANIO. 
0
SSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. How now, Lorenzo!
  NERISSA. 
0
RISSA. Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
  LORENZO. 
0
RENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
  PORTIA.

RTIA. It is almost morning,

ATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter'gatory
