Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
EXETER

Not here in presence.
KING HENRY

Send for him, good uncle.
WESTMORELAND

Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
KING HENRY

Not yet, my cousin; we would be resolv'd,

God and his angels guard your sacred throne,
KING HENRY
0
Sure, we thank you.
CANTERBURY

Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
KING HENRY

May I with right and conscience make this claim?
CANTERBURY

The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!

Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,

Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
WESTMORELAND

They know your Grace hath cause and means and might-

O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,

We must not only arm t' invade the French,

They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
KING HENRY

We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,

She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;

But there's a saying, very old and true:

It follows, then, the cat must stay at home;

Therefore doth heaven divide
KING HENRY

Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
AMBASSADOR

May't please your Majesty to give us leave
KING HENRY

We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,
AMBASSADOR

Thus then, in few.
KING HENRY
0
What treasure, uncle?
EXETER
0
Tennis-balls, my liege.
KING HENRY
0
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;

This was a merry message.
KING HENRY

We hope to make the sender blush at it.

Now all the youth of England are on fire,

Well met, Corporal Nym.

Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
BARDOLPH

What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

For my part, I care not; I say little, but when time shall

NYM

Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
PISTOL

'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
NYM
0
I am not Barbason: you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to
PISTOL
0
O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
BARDOLPH
0
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first
PISTOL
0
An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
NYM
0
I will cut thy throat one time or other, in fair terms; that
PISTOL
0
'Couple a gorge!'
BOY
0
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master; and your
BARDOLPH
0
Away, you rogue.
HOSTESS
0
By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these
BARDOLPH

Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France
PISTOL

Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
NYM

You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL
0
Base is the slave that pays.
NYM
0
That now I will have; that's the humour of it.
PISTOL
0
As manhood shall compound: push home.
BARDOLPH
0
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill
PISTOL
0
Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
BARDOLPH

Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends; an

I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL

A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;

In cash most justly paid.

Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors.

How smooth and even they do bear themselves,
BEDFORD

The King hath note of all that they intend,
EXETER

Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
KING HENRY

Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
SCROOP
0
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
KING HENRY
0
I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
CAMBRIDGE

Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
GREY

True: those that were your father's enemies
KING HENRY

We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
SCROOP
0
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
KING HENRY
0
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
SCROOP
0
That's mercy, but too much security.
KING HENRY
0
O, let us yet be merciful!
CAMBRIDGE
0
So may your Highness, and yet punish too.
GREY
0
Sir,
KING HENRY
0
Alas, your too much love and care of me
CAMBRIDGE
0
I one, my lord.
SCROOP
0
So did you me, my liege.
GREY
0
And I, my royal sovereign.
KING HENRY
0
Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
CAMBRIDGE

I do confess my fault,

The mercy that was quick in us but late
EXETER

I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard Earl

Our purposes God justly hath discover'd,

For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
GREY

Never did faithful subject more rejoice
KING HENRY

God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
HOSTESS

Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to

No; for my manly heart doth earn.

Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in

Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's bosom, if

Ay, that 'a did.
BARDOLPH

And of women.
HOSTESS

Nay, that 'a did not.

Yes, that 'a did, and said they were devils incarnate.

Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's

Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton.
PISTOL
0
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
BOY

And that's but unwholesome food, they say.
PISTOL
0
Touch her soft mouth and march.
BARDOLPH
0
Farewell, hostess.                     [Kissing her]
NYM
0
I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but adieu.
PISTOL

Let housewifery appear; keep close, I thee command.
HOSTESS

Farewell; adieu.                               Exeunt

Thus comes the English with full power upon us;

Turn head and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
    Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
    Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
    Take up the English short, and let them know
    Of what a monarchy you are the head.
    Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin

From our brother of England?

From him, and thus he greets your Majesty:

Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;

On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!
NYM

Pray thee, Corporal, stay; the knocks are too hot, and for

These be good humours. Your honour wins bad humours.

As young as I am, I have observ'd these three swashers. I am
BOY
1
FLUELLEN
As young as I am, I have observ'd these three swashers. I am
    boy to them all three; but all they three, though they would
    serve me, could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do
    not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver'd and
    red-fac'd; by the means whereof 'a faces it out, but fights not.
    For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the
    means whereof 'a breaks words and keeps whole weapons. For Nym,
    he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and
    therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought
    a coward; but his few bad words are match'd with as few good
    deeds; for 'a never broke any man's head but his own, and that
    was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything,
    and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve
    leagues, and sold it for three halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are
    sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
    fire-shovel; I knew by that piece of service the men would carry
    coals. They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their
    gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my
    manhood, if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine;
    for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and
    seek some better service; their villainy goes against my weak
    stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.               Exit

KING

SALISBURY
What's he that wishes so?
    My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin;
    If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
    To do our country loss; and if to live,
    The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
    God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
    By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
    Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
    It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
    Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
    But if it be a sin to covet honour,
    I am the most offending soul alive.
    No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
    God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
    As one man more methinks would share from me
    For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
    Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
    That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
    Let him depart; his passport shall be made,
    And crowns for convoy put into his purse;
    We would not die in that man's company
    That fears his fellowship to die with us.
    This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.
    He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
    Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
    And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
    He that shall live this day, and see old age,
    Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
    And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.'
    Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
    And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.'
    Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
    But he'll remember, with advantages,
    What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
    Familiar in his mouth as household words-
    Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
    Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester-
    Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.
    This story shall the good man teach his son;
    And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
    From this day to the ending of the world,
    But we in it shall be remembered-
    We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
    For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
    Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
    This day shall gentle his condition;
    And gentlemen in England now-a-bed
    Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
    And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
    That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
