KING JOHN
0
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
CHATILLON
0
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
ELINOR
0
A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
KING JOHN
0
Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
CHATILLON
0
Philip of France, in right and true behalf
KING JOHN
0
What follows if we disallow of this?
CHATILLON
0
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
KING JOHN
0
Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
CHATILLON
0
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
KING JOHN
0
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
ELINOR
0
What now, my son! Have I not ever said
KING JOHN
0
Our strong possession and our right for us!
ELINOR
0
Your strong possession much more than your right,
ESSEX
0
My liege, here is the strangest controversy
KING JOHN
0
Let them approach.                          Exit SHERIFF
BASTARD
0
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
KING JOHN
0
What art thou?
ROBERT
0
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
KING JOHN
0
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
BASTARD
0
Most certain of one mother, mighty king-
ELINOR
0
Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
BASTARD
0
I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
KING JOHN
0
A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
BASTARD
0
I know not why, except to get the land.
KING JOHN
0
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
ELINOR
0
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
KING JOHN
0
Mine eye hath well examined his parts
BASTARD
0
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
ROBERT
0
My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
BASTARD
0
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
ROBERT
0
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
KING JOHN
0
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
ROBERT
0
Shall then my father's will be of no force
BASTARD
0
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
ELINOR
0
Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
BASTARD
0
Madam, an if my brother had my shape
ELINOR
0
I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
BASTARD
0
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
ELINOR
0
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
BASTARD
0
Our country manners give our betters way.
KING JOHN
0
What is thy name?
BASTARD
0
Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
KING JOHN
0
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
BASTARD
0
Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
ELINOR
0
The very spirit of Plantagenet!
BASTARD
0
Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
KING JOHN
0
Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
BASTARD
0
Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
0
Where is that slave, thy brother?
BASTARD
0
My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
0
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
BASTARD
0
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
GURNEY
0
Good leave, good Philip.
BASTARD
0
Philip-Sparrow! James,
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
0
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
BASTARD
0
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
0
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
BASTARD
0
As faithfully as I deny the devil.
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE
0
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.
BASTARD
0
Now, by this light, were I to get again,
KING PHILIP
0
Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
ARTHUR
0
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
KING PHILIP
0
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
AUSTRIA
0
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
CONSTANCE
0
O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
AUSTRIA
0
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
KING PHILIP
0
Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent
CONSTANCE
0
Stay for an answer to your embassy,
KING PHILIP
0
A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,
CHATILLON
0
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
KING PHILIP
0
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
AUSTRIA
0
By how much unexpected, by so much
KING JOHN
0
Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
KING PHILIP
0
Peace be to England, if that war return
KING JOHN
0
From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
KING PHILIP
0
From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
KING JOHN
0
Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
KING PHILIP
0
Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
ELINOR
0
Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
CONSTANCE
0
Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
ELINOR
0
Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,
CONSTANCE
0
My bed was ever to thy son as true
ELINOR
0
There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
CONSTANCE
0
There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
AUSTRIA
0
Peace!
BASTARD
0
Hear the crier.
AUSTRIA
0
What the devil art thou?
BASTARD
0
One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
BLANCH
0
O, well did he become that lion's robe
BASTARD
0
It lies as sightly on the back of him
AUSTRIA
0
What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
KING PHILIP
0
Women and fools, break off your conference.
KING JOHN
0
My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
ELINOR
0
Come to thy grandam, child.
CONSTANCE
0
Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
ARTHUR
0
Good my mother, peace!
ELINOR
0
His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
CONSTANCE
0
Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
ELINOR
0
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
CONSTANCE
0
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
KING JOHN
0
Bedlam, have done.
CONSTANCE
0
I have but this to say-
ELINOR
0
Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
CONSTANCE
0
Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;
KING PHILIP
0
Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
CITIZEN
0
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
KING PHILIP
0
'Tis France, for England.
KING JOHN
0
England for itself.
KING PHILIP
0
You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
KING JOHN
0
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
KING PHILIP
0
When I have said, make answer to us both.
CITIZEN
0
In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
KING JOHN
0
Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
CITIZEN
0
That can we not; but he that proves the King,
KING JOHN
0
Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
BASTARD
0
Bastards and else.
KING JOHN
0
To verify our title with their lives.
KING PHILIP
0
As many and as well-born bloods as those-
BASTARD
0
Some bastards too.
KING PHILIP
0
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
CITIZEN
0
Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
KING JOHN
0
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
KING PHILIP
0
Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
BASTARD
0
Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since
AUSTRIA
0
Peace! no more.
BASTARD
0
O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
KING JOHN
0
Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
BASTARD
0
Speed then to take advantage of the field.
KING PHILIP
0
It shall be so; and at the other hill
KING PHILIP
0
It shall be so; and at the other hill
    Command the rest to stand. God and our right!              Exeunt
FRENCH HERALD
0
You men of Angiers, open wide your gates
ENGLISH HERALD
0
Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
CITIZEN
0
Heralds, from off our tow'rs we might behold
KING JOHN
0
France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
KING PHILIP
0
England, thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
BASTARD
0
Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs
KING JOHN
0
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
KING PHILIP
0
Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
CITIZEN
0
The King of England, when we know the King.
KING PHILIP
0
Know him in us that here hold up his right.
KING JOHN
0
In us that are our own great deputy
CITIZEN
0
A greater pow'r than we denies all this;
BASTARD
0
By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
KING JOHN
0
Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
BASTARD
0
An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
KING PHILIP
0
Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
KING JOHN
0
We from the west will send destruction
AUSTRIA
0
I from the north.
KING PHILIP
0
Our thunder from the south
BASTARD
0
 [Aside]  O prudent discipline! From north to south,
CITIZEN
0
Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
KING JOHN
0
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
CITIZEN
0
That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
BASTARD
0
Here's a stay
ELINOR
0
Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
CITIZEN
0
Why answer not the double majesties
KING PHILIP
0
Speak England first, that hath been forward first
KING JOHN
0
If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
KING PHILIP
0
What say'st thou, boy? Look in the lady's face.
LEWIS
0
I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
BASTARD
0
 [Aside]  Drawn in the flattering table of her eye,
BLANCH
0
My uncle's will in this respect is mine.
KING JOHN
0
What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?
BLANCH
0
That she is bound in honour still to do
KING JOHN
0
Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
LEWIS
0
Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
KING JOHN
0
Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
KING PHILIP
0
It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
AUSTRIA
0
And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
KING PHILIP
0
Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
LEWIS
0
She is sad and passionate at your Highness' tent.
KING PHILIP
0
And, by my faith, this league that we have made
KING JOHN
0
We will heal up all,
BASTARD
0
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
CONSTANCE
0
Gone to be married! Gone to swear a peace!
SALISBURY
0
As true as I believe you think them false
CONSTANCE
0
O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
SALISBURY
0
What other harm have I, good lady, done
CONSTANCE
0
Which harm within itself so heinous is
ARTHUR
0
I do beseech you, madam, be content.
CONSTANCE
0
If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim,
SALISBURY
0
Pardon me, madam,
CONSTANCE
0
Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee;
KING PHILIP
0
'Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day
CONSTANCE
0
 [Rising]  A wicked day, and not a holy day!
KING PHILIP
0
By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
CONSTANCE
0
You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
AUSTRIA
0
Lady Constance, peace!
CONSTANCE
0
War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war.
AUSTRIA
0
O that a man should speak those words to me!
BASTARD
0
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA
0
Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
BASTARD
0
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
KING JOHN
0
We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.
KING PHILIP
0
Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
PANDULPH
0
Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
KING JOHN
0
What earthly name to interrogatories
KING PHILIP
0
Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
KING JOHN
0
Though you and all the kings of Christendom
PANDULPH
0
Then by the lawful power that I have
CONSTANCE
0
O, lawful let it be
PANDULPH
0
There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
CONSTANCE
0
And for mine too; when law can do no right,
PANDULPH
0
Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
ELINOR
0
Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
CONSTANCE
0
Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
AUSTRIA
0
King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
BASTARD
0
And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA
0
Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
BASTARD
0
Your breeches best may carry them.
KING JOHN
0
Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
CONSTANCE
0
What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
LEWIS
0
Bethink you, father; for the difference
BLANCH
0
That's the curse of Rome.
CONSTANCE
0
O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
BLANCH
0
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
CONSTANCE
0
O, if thou grant my need,
KING JOHN
0
The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
CONSTANCE
0
O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
AUSTRIA
0
Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
BASTARD
0
Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
KING PHILIP
0
I am perplex'd and know not what to say.
PANDULPH
0
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
KING PHILIP
0
Good reverend father, make my person yours,
PANDULPH
0
All form is formless, order orderless,
KING PHILIP
0
I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
PANDULPH
0
So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;
AUSTRIA
0
Rebellion, flat rebellion!
BASTARD
0
Will't not be?
LEWIS
0
Father, to arms!
BLANCH
0
Upon thy wedding-day?
CONSTANCE
0
O, upon my knee,
BLANCH
0
Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
CONSTANCE
0
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
LEWIS
0
I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
PANDULPH
0
I will denounce a curse upon his head.
KING PHILIP
0
Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
CONSTANCE
0
O fair return of banish'd majesty!
ELINOR
0
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
KING JOHN
0
France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
BASTARD
0
Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
BLANCH
0
The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu!
LEWIS
0
Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
BLANCH
0
There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
KING JOHN
0
Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
KING PHILIP
0
Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
KING JOHN
0
No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!
BASTARD
0
Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
KING JOHN
0
Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:
BASTARD
0
My lord, I rescued her;
KING JOHN
0
 [To ELINOR]  So shall it be; your Grace shall stay
ARTHUR
0
O, this will make my mother die with grief!
KING JOHN
0
 [To the BASTARD]  Cousin, away for England! haste
BASTARD
0
Bell, book, and candle, shall not drive me back,
ELINOR
0
Farewell, gentle cousin.
KING JOHN
0
Coz, farewell.
ELINOR
0
Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
KING JOHN
0
Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
HUBERT
0
I am much bounden to your Majesty.
KING JOHN
0
Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
HUBERT
0
So well that what you bid me undertake,
KING JOHN
0
Do not I know thou wouldst?
HUBERT
0
And I'll keep him so
KING JOHN
0
Death.
HUBERT
0
My lord?
KING JOHN
0
A grave.
HUBERT
0
He shall not live.
KING JOHN
0
Enough!
ELINOR
0
My blessing go with thee!
KING JOHN
0
 [To ARTHUR]  For England, cousin, go;
KING PHILIP
0
So by a roaring tempest on the flood
PANDULPH
0
Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.
KING PHILIP
0
What can go well, when we have run so ill.
LEWIS
0
he hath won, that hath he fortified;
KING PHILIP
0
Well could I bear that England had this praise,
CONSTANCE
0
Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
KING PHILIP
0
Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
CONSTANCE
0
No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
KING PHILIP
0
O fair affliction, peace!
CONSTANCE
0
No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
PANDULPH
0
Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
CONSTANCE
0
Thou art not holy to belie me so.
KING PHILIP
0
Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
CONSTANCE
0
To England, if you will.
KING PHILIP
0
Bind up your hairs.
CONSTANCE
0
Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
PANDULPH
0
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
CONSTANCE
0
He talks to me that never had a son.
KING PHILIP
0
You are as fond of grief as of your child.
CONSTANCE
0
Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
KING PHILIP
0
I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.         Exit
LEWIS
0
There's nothing in this world can make me joy.
PANDULPH
0
Before the curing of a strong disease,
LEWIS
0
All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
PANDULPH
0
If you had won it, certainly you had.
LEWIS
0
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
PANDULPH
0
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
LEWIS
0
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
PANDULPH
0
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
LEWIS
0
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
PANDULPH
0
How green you are and fresh in this old world!
LEWIS
0
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
PANDULPH
0
O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
LEWIS
0
Strong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go;
HUBERT
0
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
EXECUTIONER
0
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
HUBERT
0
Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you. Look to't.
ARTHUR
0
Good morrow, Hubert.
HUBERT
0
Good morrow, little Prince.
ARTHUR
0
As little prince, having so great a tide
HUBERT
0
Indeed I have been merrier.
ARTHUR
0
Mercy on me!
HUBERT
0
 [Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
ARTHUR
0
Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day;
HUBERT
0
 [Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.-
ARTHUR
0
Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
HUBERT
0
Young boy, I must.
ARTHUR
0
And will you?
HUBERT
0
And I will.
ARTHUR
0
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
HUBERT
0
I have sworn to do it;
ARTHUR
0
Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
HUBERT
0
 [Stamps]  Come forth.
ARTHUR
0
O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
HUBERT
0
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
ARTHUR
0
Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
HUBERT
0
Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
EXECUTIONER
0
I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.
ARTHUR
0
Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
HUBERT
0
Come, boy, prepare yourself.
ARTHUR
0
Is there no remedy?
HUBERT
0
None, but to lose your eyes.
ARTHUR
0
O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
HUBERT
0
Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
ARTHUR
0
Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
HUBERT
0
I can heat it, boy.
ARTHUR
0
No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
HUBERT
0
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
ARTHUR
0
An if you do, you will but make it blush
HUBERT
0
Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
ARTHUR
0
O, now you look like Hubert! All this while
HUBERT
0
Peace; no more. Adieu.
ARTHUR
0
O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
HUBERT
0
Silence; no more. Go closely in with me.
KING JOHN
0
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
PEMBROKE
0
This once again, but that your Highness pleas'd,
SALISBURY
0
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
PEMBROKE
0
But that your royal pleasure must be done,
SALISBURY
0
In this the antique and well-noted face
PEMBROKE
0
When workmen strive to do better than well,
SALISBURY
0
To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
KING JOHN
0
Some reasons of this double coronation
PEMBROKE
0
Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
KING JOHN
0
Let it be so. I do commit his youth
PEMBROKE
0
This is the man should do the bloody deed:
SALISBURY
0
The colour of the King doth come and go
PEMBROKE
0
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
KING JOHN
0
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
SALISBURY
0
Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
PEMBROKE
0
Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
KING JOHN
0
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
SALISBURY
0
It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
PEMBROKE
0
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee
KING JOHN
0
They burn in indignation. I repent.
MESSENGER
0
From France to England. Never such a pow'r
KING JOHN
0
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
MESSENGER
0
My liege, her ear
KING JOHN
0
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
MESSENGER
0
Under the Dauphin.
KING JOHN
0
Thou hast made me giddy
BASTARD
0
But if you be afear'd to hear the worst,
KING JOHN
0
Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
BASTARD
0
How I have sped among the clergymen
KING JOHN
0
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
PETER
0
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
KING JOHN
0
Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
BASTARD
0
The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
KING JOHN
0
Gentle kinsman, go
BASTARD
0
I Will seek them out.
KING JOHN
0
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
BASTARD
0
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
KING JOHN
0
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
MESSENGER
0
With all my heart, my liege.                        Exit
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
My mother dead!
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Five moons!
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Old men and beldams in the streets
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
It is the curse of kings to be attended
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
My lord-
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause,
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Arm you against your other enemies,
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
ARTHUR
1
HUBERT
The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
BIGOT

HUBERT
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
The King hath dispossess'd himself of us.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
But there is little reason in your grief;
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
This is the prison. What is he lies here?
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
BIGOT
1
HUBERT
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
All murders past do stand excus'd in this;
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
It is a damned and a bloody work;
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
If that it be the work of any hand!
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
I am no villain.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
BIGOT
1
HUBERT
Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Thou art a murderer.
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Do not prove me so.
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
Cut him to pieces.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Keep the peace, I say.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
BIGOT
1
HUBERT
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Lord Bigot, I am none.
BIGOT
1
HUBERT
Who kill'd this prince?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
BIGOT
1
HUBERT
Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
There tell the King he may inquire us out.
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
There tell the King he may inquire us out.
                                                         Exeunt LORDS
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Do but hear me, sir.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Ha! I'll tell thee what:
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Upon my soul-
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
If thou didst but consent
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Go, bear him in thine arms.
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Thus have I yielded up into your hand
PANDULPH
1
HUBERT
 [Gives back the crown]  Take again
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
PANDULPH
1
HUBERT
It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Would not my lords return to me again
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
That villain Hubert told me he did live.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
O inglorious league!
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Have thou the ordering of this present time.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Away, then, with good courage!
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
A noble temper dost thou show in this;
PANDULPH
1
HUBERT
Hail, noble prince of France!
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
PANDULPH
1
HUBERT
You look but on the outside of this work.
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
Outside or inside, I will not return
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
According to the fair play of the world,
PANDULPH
1
HUBERT
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
PANDULPH
1
HUBERT
Give me leave to speak.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
No, I will speak.
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
We will attend to neither.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
This fever that hath troubled me so long
MESSENGER
1
HUBERT
My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
MESSENGER
1
HUBERT
Be of good comfort; for the great supply
KING JOHN
1
HUBERT
Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
Up once again; put spirit in the French;
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.
MELUN
1
HUBERT
Lead me to the revolts of England here.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
When we were happy we had other names.
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
It is the Count Melun.
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Wounded to death.
MELUN
1
HUBERT
Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
May this be possible? May this be true?
MELUN
1
HUBERT
Have I not hideous death within my view,
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
We do believe thee; and beshrew my soul
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
MESSENGER
1
HUBERT
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
Here; what news?
MESSENGER
1
HUBERT
The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
MESSENGER
1
HUBERT
Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
LEWIS
1
HUBERT
keep good quarter and good care to-night;
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
A friend. What art thou?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Of the part of England.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Whither dost thou go?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
What's that to thee? Why may I not demand
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Hubert, I think.
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Thou hast a perfect thought.
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Who thou wilt. And if thou please,
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Brief, then; and what's the news?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Show me the very wound of this ill news;
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
How did he take it; who did taste to him?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
HUBERT
1
HUBERT
Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
BASTARD
1
HUBERT
Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
PRINCE HENRY
1
HUBERT
It is too late; the life of all his blood
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
PRINCE HENRY
1
HUBERT
Let him be brought into the orchard here.
PRINCE HENRY
1
HUBERT
Let him be brought into the orchard here.
    Doth he still rage?                                    Exit BIGOT
PEMBROKE
1
HUBERT
He is more patient
PRINCE HENRY
1
HUBERT
O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
SALISBURY
1
HUBERT
Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
SALISBURY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
    To set a form upon that indigest
    Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
KING JOHN
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
PRINCE HENRY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
How fares your Majesty?
KING JOHN
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Poison'd-ill-fare! Dead, forsook, cast off;
PRINCE HENRY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
O that there were some virtue in my tears,
KING JOHN
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
The salt in them is hot.
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
O, I am scalded with my violent motion
KING JOHN
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye!
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
SALISBURY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
PRINCE HENRY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
SALISBURY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
He will the rather do it when he sees
SALISBURY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Let it be so. And you, my noble Prince,
PRINCE HENRY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
Thither shall it, then;
SALISBURY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
And the like tender of our love we make,
PRINCE HENRY
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
BASTARD
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
