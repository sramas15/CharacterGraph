  BASTARD.

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.
                                           Exeunt all but the BASTARD
    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

    Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
    To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth
    The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
    Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
    Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
    And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace;
    Now powers from home and discontents at home
    Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
    As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
    The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
    Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
    Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,
    And follow me with speed. I'll to the King;
    A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
    And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.                Exeunt

    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
    And with a great heart heave away this storm;
    Commend these waters to those baby eyes
    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.

  CHATILLON. 
1
KING JOHN
ATILLON. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
  ELINOR. 
1
KING JOHN
INOR. A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  KING 
1
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  CHATILLON.

KING JOHN
ATILLON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf
  KING 
1
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?
  CHATILLON. 
1
KING JOHN
ATILLON. The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
  KING 
1
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
  CHATILLON. 
1
KING JOHN
ATILLON. Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE

NG JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
  BASTARD.

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE

  ELINOR. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
INOR. Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. I know not why, except to get the land.
  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  ELINOR. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
INOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
  ROBERT. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN

2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN

  ROBERT. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
BERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
  ROBERT.

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN

  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
  ELINOR. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
INOR. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN

  ELINOR.

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE

  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. What is thy name?
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
  ELINOR. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
INOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
  KING 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
NG JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
  BASTARD. 
2
ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN

  BASTARD.

ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE
KING JOHN
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.
                                           Exeunt all but the BASTARD
    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,

    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,

WIS. Outside or inside, I will not return
    Till my attempt so much be glorified
    As to my ample hope was promised
    Before I drew this gallant head of war,
    And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
    To outlook conquest, and to will renown
    Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
                                                     [Trumpet sounds]

  BASTARD. 
1

STARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
  KING

NG JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
  BASTARD.

STARD. I know not why, except to get the land.
  KING 
1
ROBERT
NG JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  ELINOR. 
1
ROBERT
INOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
  KING 
1
ROBERT
NG JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts
  BASTARD. 
1
ROBERT

  BASTARD.

ROBERT
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.
                                           Exeunt all but the BASTARD
    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
  LADY 
1
ROBERT
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?

CHATILLON
ROBERT
NSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embassy,

    And then we shall repent each drop of blood
    That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.

ROBERT

ROBERT

  KING

  KING 
2

    Coldly embracing the discoloured earth;
    And victory with little loss doth play
    Upon the dancing banners of the French,

    To enter conquerors, and to proclaim

    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
    And with a great heart heave away this storm;
    Commend these waters to those baby eyes
    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
    Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep

    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

    Let me wipe off this honourable dew
    That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.
    My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
    Being an ordinary inundation;
    But this effusion of such manly drops,
    This show'r, blown up by tempest of the soul,
    Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd
    Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
    Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors.
    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
    And with a great heart heave away this storm;
    Commend these waters to those baby eyes
    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
    Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
    Into the purse of rich prosperity
    As Lewis himself. So, nobles, shall you all,

    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

    Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer'd blows;

    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.

    Of this most fair occasion, by the which
    We will untread the steps of damned flight,
    And like a bated and retired flood,
    Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
    Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,
    And calmly run on in obedience
    Even to our ocean, to great King John.
    My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
    For I do see the cruel pangs of death
    Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight,
    And happy newness, that intends old right.

    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

  CITIZEN.

    Who by the hand of France this day hath made
    Much work for tears in many an English mother,
    Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
    Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
    Coldly embracing the discoloured earth;
    And victory with little loss doth play
    Upon the dancing banners of the French,

    From first to last the onset and retire
    Of both your armies, whose equality
    By our best eyes cannot be censured.
    Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer'd blows;
    Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power;
    Both are alike, and both alike we like.
    One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,
    We hold our town for neither, yet for both.

STARD. Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

ROBERT
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.
                                           Exeunt all but the BASTARD
    A foot of honour better than I was;
    But many a many foot of land the worse.
    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
    'Tis too respective and too sociable
    For your conversion. Now your traveller,
    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
    And then comes answer like an Absey book:
    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
    At your employment, at your service, sir!'
    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
    And so, ere answer knows what question would,
    Saving in dialogue of compliment,
    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
    The Pyrenean and the river Po-
    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
    But this is worshipful society,
    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation-
    And so am I, whether I smack or no;
    And not alone in habit and device,
    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
    But from the inward motion to deliver
    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
  LADY

ROBERT
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?

  CITIZEN.

    Who by the hand of France this day hath made
    Much work for tears in many an English mother,
    Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
    Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
    Coldly embracing the discoloured earth;
    And victory with little loss doth play

    From first to last the onset and retire
    Of both your armies, whose equality
    By our best eyes cannot be censured.
    Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer'd blows;
    Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power;
    Both are alike, and both alike we like.
    One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,
    We hold our town for neither, yet for both.

    Some speedy messenger bid her repair
    To our solemnity. I trust we shall,
    If not fill up the measure of her will,
    Yet in some measure satisfy her so
    That we shall stop her exclamation.
    Go we as well as haste will suffer us
    To this unlook'd-for, unprepared pomp.

STARD. Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
    John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
    Hath willingly departed with a part;
    And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
    Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
    With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
    That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
    That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
    Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
    Who having no external thing to lose
    But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
    That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
    Commodity, the bias of the world-
    The world, who of itself is peised well,
    Made to run even upon even ground,
    Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
    This sway of motion, this commodity,
    Makes it take head from all indifferency,
    From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
    And this same bias, this commodity,
    This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
    Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
    Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
    From a resolv'd and honourable war,
    To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
    And why rail I on this commodity?
    But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
    Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
    When his fair angels would salute my palm,
    But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
    Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
    Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
    And say there is no sin but to be rich;
    And being rich, my virtue then shall be
    To say there is no vice but beggary.
    Since kings break faith upon commodity,
    Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.                   Exit

    Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
    And with a great heart heave away this storm;
    Commend these waters to those baby eyes
    That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
    Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
    Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
    Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep

0
STARD. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Our country manners give our betters way.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What is thy name?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
  GURNEY.

  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip-Sparrow! James,
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embassy,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace be to England, if that war return
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hear the crier.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What the devil art thou?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. O, well did he become that lion's robe
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Women and fools, break off your conference.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Come to thy grandam, child.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good my mother, peace!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bedlam, have done.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. I have but this to say-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. 'Tis France, for England.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. England for itself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. When I have said, make answer to us both.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Bastards and else.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. To verify our title with their lives.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. As many and as well-born bloods as those-
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Some bastards too.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
  BASTARD.

STARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace! no more.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Speed then to take advantage of the field.
  KING

NG PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill

NG PHILIP. England, thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Know him in us that here hold up his right.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. In us that are our own great deputy
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. A greater pow'r than we denies all this;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We from the west will send destruction
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. I from the north.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Our thunder from the south
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD.  [Aside]  O prudent discipline! From north to south,
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
  KING

NG JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
  CITIZEN.

STARD. Here's a stay
  ELINOR.

INOR. Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
  CITIZEN.

TIZEN. Why answer not the double majesties
  KING

NG PHILIP. Speak England first, that hath been forward first
  KING

NG JOHN. If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,

  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD.  [Aside]  Drawn in the flattering table of her eye,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. My uncle's will in this respect is mine.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. That she is bound in honour still to do
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. She is sad and passionate at your Highness' tent.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. And, by my faith, this league that we have made
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We will heal up all,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Gone to be married! Gone to swear a peace!
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. As true as I believe you think them false
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. What other harm have I, good lady, done
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Which harm within itself so heinous is
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. I do beseech you, madam, be content.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Pardon me, madam,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. 'Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE.  [Rising]  A wicked day, and not a holy day!
  KING

NG PHILIP. By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE. You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
  AUSTRIA.

STRIA. Lady Constance, peace!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What earthly name to interrogatories
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Though you and all the kings of Christendom
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Then by the lawful power that I have
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, lawful let it be
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. And for mine too; when law can do no right,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your breeches best may carry them.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Bethink you, father; for the difference
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. That's the curse of Rome.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, if thou grant my need,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I am perplex'd and know not what to say.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Good reverend father, make my person yours,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. All form is formless, order orderless,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Will't not be?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Father, to arms!
  BLANCH.

ANCH. Upon thy wedding-day?
  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE. O, upon my knee,
  BLANCH.

ANCH. Now shall I see thy love. What motive may

0
NSTANCE. That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. I will denounce a curse upon his head.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O fair return of banish'd majesty!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:

0
STARD. My lord, I rescued her;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN.  [To ELINOR]  So shall it be; your Grace shall stay
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, this will make my mother die with grief!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN.  [To the BASTARD]  Cousin, away for England! haste
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Bell, book, and candle, shall not drive me back,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Farewell, gentle cousin.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Coz, farewell.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I am much bounden to your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. So well that what you bid me undertake,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Do not I know thou wouldst?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I'll keep him so
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Death.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. My lord?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. A grave.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. He shall not live.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Enough!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. My blessing go with thee!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN.  [To ARTHUR]  For England, cousin, go;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. So by a roaring tempest on the flood
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. What can go well, when we have run so ill.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. he hath won, that hath he fortified;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Well could I bear that England had this praise,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. O fair affliction, peace!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou art not holy to belie me so.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. To England, if you will.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up your hairs.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. He talks to me that never had a son.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.         Exit
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. There's nothing in this world can make me joy.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Before the curing of a strong disease,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. If you had won it, certainly you had.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. How green you are and fresh in this old world!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Strong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
  EXECUTIONER. 
0
ECUTIONER. I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you. Look to't.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good morrow, Hubert.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Good morrow, little Prince.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. As little prince, having so great a tide
  HUBERT.

BERT. Indeed I have been merrier.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Mercy on me!
  HUBERT.

BERT.  [Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.-
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Young boy, I must.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. And will you?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I will.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I have sworn to do it;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Stamps]  Come forth.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
  EXECUTIONER. 
0
ECUTIONER. I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Come, boy, prepare yourself.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Is there no remedy?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. None, but to lose your eyes.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I can heat it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while
  HUBERT.

NG JOHN. Let it be so. I do commit his youth
  PEMBROKE.

MBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed:
  SALISBURY.

LISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go
  PEMBROKE.

MBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence

MBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. They burn in indignation. I repent.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. From France to England. Never such a pow'r
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. My liege, her ear
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Under the Dauphin.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Thou hast made me giddy
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. But if you be afear'd to hear the worst,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. How I have sped among the clergymen
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
  PETER. 
0
TER. Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Gentle kinsman, go
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I Will seek them out.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. With all my heart, my liege.                        Exit
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. My mother dead!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Five moons!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Old men and beldams in the streets
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. My lord-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Arm you against your other enemies,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
  BIGOT. 
0
GOT. To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. But there is little reason in your grief;
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here?
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
  BIGOT. 
0
GOT. Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. All murders past do stand excus'd in this;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. It is a damned and a bloody work;
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand!
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I am no villain.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
  BIGOT. 
0
GOT. Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Thou art a murderer.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Do not prove me so.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Cut him to pieces.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Keep the peace, I say.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
  BIGOT. 
0
GOT. What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Lord Bigot, I am none.
  BIGOT. 
0
GOT. Who kill'd this prince?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. 'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
  BIGOT. 
0
GOT. Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Do but hear me, sir.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Ha! I'll tell thee what:
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Upon my soul-
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. If thou didst but consent
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Thus have I yielded up into your hand
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH.  [Gives back the crown]  Take again
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Would not my lords return to me again
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. That villain Hubert told me he did live.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O inglorious league!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Away, then, with good courage!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. A noble temper dost thou show in this;
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Outside or inside, I will not return
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. According to the fair play of the world,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Give me leave to speak.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. No, I will speak.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. We will attend to neither.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. This fever that hath troubled me so long
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French;
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.
  MELUN. 
0
LUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. It is the Count Melun.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Wounded to death.
  MELUN. 
0
LUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?
  MELUN. 
0
LUN. Have I not hideous death within my view,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. We do believe thee; and beshrew my soul
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Here; what news?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. keep good quarter and good care to-night;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. A friend. What art thou?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Of the part of England.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Whither dost thou go?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. What's that to thee? Why may I not demand
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hubert, I think.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Thou hast a perfect thought.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brief, then; and what's the news?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. How did he take it; who did taste to him?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. It is too late; the life of all his blood
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. He is more patient
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. How fares your Majesty?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Poison'd-ill-fare! Dead, forsook, cast off;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. O that there were some virtue in my tears,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. The salt in them is hot.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O, I am scalded with my violent motion
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. He will the rather do it when he sees
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Let it be so. And you, my noble Prince,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Thither shall it, then;
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE HENRY. I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. What now, my son! Have I not ever said
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Our strong possession and our right for us!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Your strong possession much more than your right,
  ESSEX. 
0
SEX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Let them approach.                          Exit SHERIFF
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What art thou?
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I know not why, except to get the land.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. Shall then my father's will be of no force
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, an if my brother had my shape
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Our country manners give our betters way.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What is thy name?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
  GURNEY. 
0
RNEY. Good leave, good Philip.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip-Sparrow! James,
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embassy,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace be to England, if that war return
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hear the crier.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What the devil art thou?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. O, well did he become that lion's robe
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Women and fools, break off your conference.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Come to thy grandam, child.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good my mother, peace!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bedlam, have done.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. I have but this to say-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. 'Tis France, for England.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. England for itself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. When I have said, make answer to us both.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Bastards and else.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. To verify our title with their lives.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. As many and as well-born bloods as those-
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Some bastards too.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace! no more.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Speed then to take advantage of the field.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill
  KING

STRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  BASTARD.

NG PHILIP. Good reverend father, make my person yours,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. All form is formless, order orderless,
  KING

  ELINOR.

  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I am much bounden to your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
  HUBERT.

  CONSTANCE.

NG PHILIP. O fair affliction, peace!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou art not holy to belie me so.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. To England, if you will.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up your hairs.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. He talks to me that never had a son.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE. Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
  KING

NDULPH. If you had won it, certainly you had.
  LEWIS.

WIS. As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
  PANDULPH.

NDULPH. Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
  PANDULPH.

NDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. How green you are and fresh in this old world!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,

THUR. Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day;
  HUBERT.

BERT.  [Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.-
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Young boy, I must.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. And will you?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I will.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I have sworn to do it;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Stamps]  Come forth.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
  EXECUTIONER.

ECUTIONER. I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.
  ARTHUR.

THUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Come, boy, prepare yourself.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Is there no remedy?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. None, but to lose your eyes.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I can heat it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
  HUBERT.

BERT. Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
  ARTHUR.

THUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while
  HUBERT.

LISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face
  PEMBROKE.

0
LISBURY. To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Some reasons of this double coronation
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Let it be so. I do commit his youth
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed:
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
  PEMBROKE.

  BASTARD.

STARD. How I have sped among the clergymen
  KING

  PETER.

TER. Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
  KING

HUBERT
NG JOHN. Five moons!
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT

  KING

HUBERT

  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. My lord-
  KING 
1
HUBERT

HUBERT

  ARTHUR. 
1
HUBERT
THUR. The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. But there is little reason in your grief;
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here?
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. All murders past do stand excus'd in this;
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. It is a damned and a bloody work;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand!
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. I am no villain.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Thou art a murderer.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Do not prove me so.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Cut him to pieces.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Keep the peace, I say.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Lord Bigot, I am none.
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Who kill'd this prince?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. 'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT

1
HUBERT
STARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Do but hear me, sir.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Ha! I'll tell thee what:
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Upon my soul-
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. If thou didst but consent
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Thus have I yielded up into your hand
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH.  [Gives back the crown]  Take again
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Would not my lords return to me again
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. That villain Hubert told me he did live.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. O inglorious league!
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Away, then, with good courage!
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. A noble temper dost thou show in this;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France!
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Outside or inside, I will not return
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. According to the fair play of the world,
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. Give me leave to speak.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. No, I will speak.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. We will attend to neither.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. This fever that hath troubled me so long
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. It is the Count Melun.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Wounded to death.
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Have I not hideous death within my view,
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. We do believe thee; and beshrew my soul
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Here; what news?
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. keep good quarter and good care to-night;
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. A friend. What art thou?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Of the part of England.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Whither dost thou go?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. What's that to thee? Why may I not demand
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Hubert, I think.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Thou hast a perfect thought.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please,
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Brief, then; and what's the news?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news;
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. How did he take it; who did taste to him?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
  PRINCE 
1
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. It is too late; the life of all his blood
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
  PRINCE 
1
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here.
  PRINCE 
1
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here.
    Doth he still rage?                                    Exit BIGOT
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. He is more patient
  PRINCE 
1
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
    To set a form upon that indigest
    Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. How fares your Majesty?
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Poison'd-ill-fare! Dead, forsook, cast off;
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. O that there were some virtue in my tears,
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. The salt in them is hot.
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. O, I am scalded with my violent motion
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye!
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. He will the rather do it when he sees
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. Nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. Let it be so. And you, my noble Prince,
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. Thither shall it, then;
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make,
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. What now, my son! Have I not ever said
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Our strong possession and our right for us!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Your strong possession much more than your right,
  ESSEX. 
0
SEX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Let them approach.                          Exit SHERIFF
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What art thou?
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I know not why, except to get the land.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. Shall then my father's will be of no force
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, an if my brother had my shape
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Our country manners give our betters way.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What is thy name?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
  GURNEY. 
0
RNEY. Good leave, good Philip.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip-Sparrow! James,
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embassy,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace be to England, if that war return
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hear the crier.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What the devil art thou?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. O, well did he become that lion's robe
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Women and fools, break off your conference.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Come to thy grandam, child.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good my mother, peace!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bedlam, have done.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. I have but this to say-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. 'Tis France, for England.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. England for itself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. When I have said, make answer to us both.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Bastards and else.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. To verify our title with their lives.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. As many and as well-born bloods as those-
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Some bastards too.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace! no more.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Speed then to take advantage of the field.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill
    Command the rest to stand. God and our right!              Exeunt

GLISH HERALD. Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Heralds, from off our tow'rs we might behold
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. England, thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Know him in us that here hold up his right.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. In us that are our own great deputy
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. A greater pow'r than we denies all this;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We from the west will send destruction
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. I from the north.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Our thunder from the south
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD.  [Aside]  O prudent discipline! From north to south,
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
  CITIZEN.

STARD. Here's a stay
  ELINOR.

  CITIZEN.

  KING

  KING

WIS. I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
  BASTARD.

STARD.  [Aside]  Drawn in the flattering table of her eye,
  BLANCH.

ANCH. My uncle's will in this respect is mine.
  KING

NG JOHN. What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. That she is bound in honour still to do
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
  LEWIS.

  KING

0
NSTANCE.  [Rising]  A wicked day, and not a holy day!
  KING

NG PHILIP. By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE. You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
  AUSTRIA.

STRIA. Lady Constance, peace!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What earthly name to interrogatories
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Though you and all the kings of Christendom
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Then by the lawful power that I have
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, lawful let it be
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. And for mine too; when law can do no right,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
  AUSTRIA.

STRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
  BASTARD.

STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your breeches best may carry them.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Bethink you, father; for the difference
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. That's the curse of Rome.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, if thou grant my need,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I am perplex'd and know not what to say.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Good reverend father, make my person yours,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. All form is formless, order orderless,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Will't not be?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Father, to arms!
  BLANCH.

NSTANCE. That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,

WIS. I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
  PANDULPH.

NDULPH. I will denounce a curse upon his head.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O fair return of banish'd majesty!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
  BASTARD.

STARD. Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
  BLANCH.

INOR. Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I am much bounden to your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. So well that what you bid me undertake,
  KING

NG JOHN. Do not I know thou wouldst?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I'll keep him so
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Death.

NG PHILIP. So by a roaring tempest on the flood
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. What can go well, when we have run so ill.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. he hath won, that hath he fortified;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Well could I bear that England had this praise,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. O fair affliction, peace!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou art not holy to belie me so.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. To England, if you will.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up your hairs.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. He talks to me that never had a son.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.         Exit
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. There's nothing in this world can make me joy.

NDULPH. Before the curing of a strong disease,
  LEWIS.

WIS. All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. If you had won it, certainly you had.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. How green you are and fresh in this old world!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Strong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
  EXECUTIONER. 
0
ECUTIONER. I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
  HUBERT.

  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good morrow, Hubert.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Good morrow, little Prince.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. As little prince, having so great a tide
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Indeed I have been merrier.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Mercy on me!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.-
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Young boy, I must.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. And will you?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I will.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I have sworn to do it;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Stamps]  Come forth.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
  EXECUTIONER.

ECUTIONER. I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.
  ARTHUR.

THUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Come, boy, prepare yourself.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Is there no remedy?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. None, but to lose your eyes.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I can heat it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while
  HUBERT.

BERT. Peace; no more. Adieu.

MBROKE. But that your royal pleasure must be done,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face
  PEMBROKE.

MBROKE. When workmen strive to do better than well,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Some reasons of this double coronation
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Let it be so. I do commit his youth
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed:
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. They burn in indignation. I repent.

  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. But if you be afear'd to hear the worst,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. How I have sped among the clergymen
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
  PETER. 
0
TER. Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
  BASTARD.

1
HUBERT

  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Five moons!
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Old men and beldams in the streets
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. My lord-
  KING

HUBERT
BERT. Arm you against your other enemies,
  KING

  ARTHUR. 
1
HUBERT
THUR. The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. But there is little reason in your grief;
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here?
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. All murders past do stand excus'd in this;
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. It is a damned and a bloody work;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand!
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. I am no villain.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Thou art a murderer.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Do not prove me so.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Cut him to pieces.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Keep the peace, I say.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Lord Bigot, I am none.
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Who kill'd this prince?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. 'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
  PEMBROKE.

MBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out.

STARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  HUBERT.

HUBERT
BERT. Do but hear me, sir.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Ha! I'll tell thee what:
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Upon my soul-
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. If thou didst but consent
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.
  KING

HUBERT
NG JOHN. Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Would not my lords return to me again
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. That villain Hubert told me he did live.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. O inglorious league!
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Away, then, with good courage!
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. A noble temper dost thou show in this;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France!
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Outside or inside, I will not return
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. According to the fair play of the world,
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. Give me leave to speak.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. No, I will speak.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. We will attend to neither.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
  KING

  KING

HUBERT
NG JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT

  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,

  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. It is the Count Melun.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Wounded to death.
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Have I not hideous death within my view,
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. We do believe thee; and beshrew my soul

HUBERT
SSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin?

1
HUBERT
STARD. A friend. What art thou?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Of the part of England.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Whither dost thou go?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. What's that to thee? Why may I not demand
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Hubert, I think.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Thou hast a perfect thought.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please,
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Brief, then; and what's the news?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news;
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. How did he take it; who did taste to him?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
  BASTARD.

HUBERT
STARD. Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,

  PEMBROKE.

  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born
    To set a form upon that indigest
    Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. How fares your Majesty?
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Poison'd-ill-fare! Dead, forsook, cast off;
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. O that there were some virtue in my tears,
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. The salt in them is hot.
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. O, I am scalded with my violent motion
  KING 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
NG JOHN. O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye!
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. He will the rather do it when he sees
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. Nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. Let it be so. And you, my noble Prince,
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. Thither shall it, then;
  SALISBURY. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
LISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make,
  PRINCE 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
INCE HENRY. I have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
  BASTARD. 
2
BIGOT
HUBERT
STARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. What now, my son! Have I not ever said
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Our strong possession and our right for us!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Your strong possession much more than your right,
  ESSEX. 
0
SEX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Let them approach.                          Exit SHERIFF
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What art thou?
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. I know not why, except to get the land.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
  ROBERT. 
0
BERT. Shall then my father's will be of no force
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, an if my brother had my shape
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Our country manners give our betters way.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What is thy name?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
  GURNEY. 
0
RNEY. Good leave, good Philip.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Philip-Sparrow! James,
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.
  LADY 
0
DY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embassy,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,
  CHATILLON. 
0
ATILLON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace be to England, if that war return
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hear the crier.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What the devil art thou?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. O, well did he become that lion's robe
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Women and fools, break off your conference.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Come to thy grandam, child.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good my mother, peace!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bedlam, have done.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. I have but this to say-
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. 'Tis France, for England.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. England for itself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. When I have said, make answer to us both.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Bastards and else.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. To verify our title with their lives.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. As many and as well-born bloods as those-
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Some bastards too.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Peace! no more.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Speed then to take advantage of the field.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill
    Command the rest to stand. God and our right!              Exeunt

GLISH HERALD. Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:

TIZEN. Heralds, from off our tow'rs we might behold
  KING

NG JOHN. France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. England, thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Know him in us that here hold up his right.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. In us that are our own great deputy
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. A greater pow'r than we denies all this;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We from the west will send destruction
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. I from the north.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Our thunder from the south
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD.  [Aside]  O prudent discipline! From north to south,
  CITIZEN. 
0
TIZEN. Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
  KING

STARD.  [Aside]  Drawn in the flattering table of her eye,

ANCH. My uncle's will in this respect is mine.
  KING

NG JOHN. What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. That she is bound in honour still to do
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
  LEWIS.

  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. And, by my faith, this league that we have made
  KING

NSTANCE. Which harm within itself so heinous is
  ARTHUR.

  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE.  [Rising]  A wicked day, and not a holy day!

  AUSTRIA.

STRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. What earthly name to interrogatories
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Though you and all the kings of Christendom
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Then by the lawful power that I have
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, lawful let it be
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. And for mine too; when law can do no right,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
  ELINOR. 
0
INOR. Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Your breeches best may carry them.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Bethink you, father; for the difference
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. That's the curse of Rome.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
  BLANCH. 
0
ANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O, if thou grant my need,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I am perplex'd and know not what to say.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Good reverend father, make my person yours,
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. All form is formless, order orderless,
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;
  AUSTRIA. 
0
STRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!
  BASTARD.

STARD. Will't not be?
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Father, to arms!

NG JOHN. Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I am much bounden to your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. So well that what you bid me undertake,
  KING

NG JOHN. Do not I know thou wouldst?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I'll keep him so

NG JOHN. Death.

  KING

NG PHILIP. What can go well, when we have run so ill.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. he hath won, that hath he fortified;
  KING

NG PHILIP. Well could I bear that England had this praise,
  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE. Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
  CONSTANCE.

NSTANCE. No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
  KING

NG PHILIP. O fair affliction, peace!
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Thou art not holy to belie me so.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. To England, if you will.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. Bind up your hairs.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
  CONSTANCE. 
0
NSTANCE. He talks to me that never had a son.
  KING 
0
NG PHILIP. You are as fond of grief as of your child.
  CONSTANCE.

WIS. All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. If you had won it, certainly you had.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
  PANDULPH. 
0
NDULPH. How green you are and fresh in this old world!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
  PANDULPH.

NDULPH. O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,

BERT. Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
  EXECUTIONER.

ECUTIONER. I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
  HUBERT.

  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Good morrow, Hubert.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Good morrow, little Prince.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. As little prince, having so great a tide
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Indeed I have been merrier.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Mercy on me!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day;
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.-
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Young boy, I must.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. And will you?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. And I will.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I have sworn to do it;
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT.  [Stamps]  Come forth.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
  EXECUTIONER.

  ARTHUR.

THUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Come, boy, prepare yourself.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Is there no remedy?
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. None, but to lose your eyes.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. I can heat it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
  HUBERT. 
0
BERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
  ARTHUR. 
0
THUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
  HUBERT.

BERT. Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
  ARTHUR.

NG JOHN. Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
  PEMBROKE.

0
LISBURY. Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. But that your royal pleasure must be done,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. When workmen strive to do better than well,
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Some reasons of this double coronation
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Let it be so. I do commit his youth
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed:
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
  PEMBROKE. 
0
MBROKE. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. They burn in indignation. I repent.
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. My liege, her ear
  KING

NG JOHN. Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Under the Dauphin.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Thou hast made me giddy
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. But if you be afear'd to hear the worst,
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. How I have sped among the clergymen
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
  PETER. 
0
TER. Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
  KING 
0
NG JOHN. Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
  KING

1
HUBERT
BERT. My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Five moons!
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Old men and beldams in the streets
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. My lord-
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause,
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Arm you against your other enemies,
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
  ARTHUR. 
1
HUBERT
THUR. The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. But there is little reason in your grief;
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here?
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. All murders past do stand excus'd in this;
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. It is a damned and a bloody work;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand!
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. I am no villain.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Thou art a murderer.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Do not prove me so.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Cut him to pieces.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Keep the peace, I say.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Lord Bigot, I am none.
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Who kill'd this prince?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. 'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
  BIGOT. 
1
HUBERT
GOT. Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out.
  PEMBROKE.

HUBERT
MBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out.

  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Do but hear me, sir.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Ha! I'll tell thee what:
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Upon my soul-
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. If thou didst but consent
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Go, bear him in thine arms.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Thus have I yielded up into your hand
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH.  [Gives back the crown]  Take again
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Would not my lords return to me again
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. That villain Hubert told me he did live.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. O inglorious league!
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Away, then, with good courage!
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. A noble temper dost thou show in this;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France!
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Outside or inside, I will not return
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. According to the fair play of the world,
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
  PANDULPH. 
1
HUBERT
NDULPH. Give me leave to speak.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. No, I will speak.
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. We will attend to neither.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?

HUBERT
SSENGER. My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,

HUBERT
NG JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply
  KING 
1
HUBERT
NG JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
  PEMBROKE. 
1
HUBERT
MBROKE. It is the Count Melun.
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. Wounded to death.
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?
  MELUN. 
1
HUBERT
LUN. Have I not hideous death within my view,
  SALISBURY. 
1
HUBERT
LISBURY. We do believe thee; and beshrew my soul
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Here; what news?
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
  LEWIS. 
1
HUBERT
WIS. Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
  MESSENGER. 
1
HUBERT
SSENGER. Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
  LEWIS.

HUBERT
WIS. keep good quarter and good care to-night;
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. A friend. What art thou?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Of the part of England.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Whither dost thou go?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. What's that to thee? Why may I not demand
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Hubert, I think.
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Thou hast a perfect thought.
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please,
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Brief, then; and what's the news?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news;
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. How did he take it; who did taste to him?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
  HUBERT. 
1
HUBERT
BERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
  BASTARD. 
1
HUBERT
STARD. Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
