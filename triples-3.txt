 to a gossips' feast, and go with me;

0
  To 
0
 merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
  It 
0
 hath in solemn synods been decreed,
  To 
0
 admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
  Be 
0
 seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  To 
0
 quit the penalty and to ransom him.
  My 
0
 woes end likewise with the evening sun.
  In 
0
 Syracuse was I born, and wed
  By 
0
 prosperous voyages I often made
  To 
0
 Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
  As 
0
 could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
  Of 
0
 such a burden, male twins, both alike.
  My 
0
 wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  We 
0
 came aboard.
  My 
0
 wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  To 
0
 him one of the other twins was bound,
  At 
0
 length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
  Of 
0
 Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
  We 
0
 were encount'red by a mighty rock,
  So 
0
 that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  By 
0
 fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  At 
0
 length another ship had seiz'd on us;
  To 
0
 tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
  Do 
0
 me the favour to dilate at full
  At 
0
 eighteen years became inquisitive
  Or 
0
 that or any place that harbours men.
  To 
0
 bear the extremity of dire mishap!
  My 
0
 soul should sue as advocate for thee.
  To 
0
 seek thy help by beneficial hap.
  Is 
0
 apprehended for arrival here;
  Of 
0
 whom I hope to make much benefit;
  My 
0
 present business calls me from you now.
  So 
0
 I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In 
0
 quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
  My 
0
 mistress made it one upon my cheek;
  To 
0
 pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
  We 
0
 being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
  So 
0
 great a charge from thine own custody?
  If 
0
 I return, I shall be post indeed,
  ANTIPHOLUS 
0
TIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
  My 
0
 mistress and her sister stays for you.
  In 
0
 what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
  Or 
0
 I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
  If 
0
 I should pay your worship those again,
  If 
0
 it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
  Of 
0
 more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
  We 
0
 bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
  As 
0
 much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
  So 
0
 thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
  It 
0
 seems he hath great care to please his wife.
  He 
0
 ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
  So 
0
 that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  If 
0
 I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
  If 
0
 voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
  Do 
0
 their gay vestments his affections bait?
  By 
0
 him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
  Of 
0
 my defeatures. My decayed fair
  Or 
0
 else what lets it but he would be here?
  So 
0
 he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
  By 
0
 falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
  Is 
0
 wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
  By 
0
 computation and mine host's report
  As 
0
 you love strokes, so jest with me again.
  My 
0
 house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  Do 
0
 use you for my fool and chat with you,
  If 
0
 you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  Or 
0
 I will beat this method in your sconce.
  Am 
0
 better than thy dear self's better part.
  As 
0
 take from me thyself, and not me too.
  By 
0
 ruffian lust should be contaminate!
  My 
0
 blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
  In 
0
 Ephesus I am but two hours old,
  As 
0
 strange unto your town as to your talk,
  To 
0
 counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
  Be 
0
 it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  If 
0
 aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Or 
0
 sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
  We 
0
 talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
  If 
0
 we obey them not, this will ensue:
  To 
0
 put the finger in the eye and weep,
  My 
0
 wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
  To 
0
 see the making of her carcanet,
  He 
0
 met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
  If 
0
 the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
  By 
0
 the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
  My 
0
 master stays in the street.
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
    -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
  It 
0
 would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
  If 
0
 a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
  Be 
0
 rul'd by me: depart in patience,
  To 
0
 know the reason of this strange restraint.
  If 
0
 by strong hand you offer to break in
  My 
0
 wife-but, I protest, without desert-
  To 
0
 her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  Be 
0
 it for nothing but to spite my wife-
  If 
0
 you did wed my sister for her wealth,
  Be 
0
 not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
  Be 
0
 secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
  We 
0
 in your motion turn, and you may move us.
  To 
0
 make it wander in an unknown field?
  O, 
0
 train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  To 
0
 drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
  He 
0
 gains by death that hath such means to die.
  It 
0
 is thyself, mine own self's better part;
  My 
0
 food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
  My 
0
 sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
  Am 
0
 I your man? Am I myself?
  An 
0
 if the wind blow any way from shore,
  If 
0
 any bark put forth, come to the mart,
  If 
0
 every one knows us, and we know none,
  So 
0
 fly I from her that would be my wife.
  Of 
0
 such enchanting presence and discourse,
  Go 
0
 home with it, and please your wife withal;
  If 
0
 any ship put out, then straight away.
  To 
0
 Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Or 
0
 I'll attach you by this officer.
  Is 
0
 growing to me by Antipholus;
  He 
0
 had of me a chain; at five o'clock
  If 
0
 it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
  Or 
0
 else you may return without your money.
  If 
0
 not, I'll leave him to the officer.
  Or 
0
 I attach you by this officer.
  If 
0
 he should scorn me so apparently.
  As 
0
 all the metal in your shop will answer.
  To 
0
 your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
  To 
0
 Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
  Of 
0
 his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
  My 
0
 tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  He 
0
 is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
  No 
0
 evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  My 
0
 heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  It 
0
 was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
  If 
0
 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
  As 
0
 if I were their well-acquainted friend;
  Is 
0
 that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
  Is 
0
 a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of 
0
 his own doors being shut against his entrance.
  On 
0
 purpose shut the doors against his way.
  My 
0
 way is now to hie home to his house,
  He 
0
 rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My 
0
 ring away. This course I fittest choose,
  To 
0
 warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
  My 
0
 wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
  To 
0
 yield possession to my holy prayers,
  By 
0
 Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
  To 
0
 make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
  To 
0
 make a rescue?
  He 
0
 is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
  Do 
0
 outrage and displeasure to himself?
  Be 
0
 mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
  Of 
0
 credit infinite, highly belov'd,
  To 
0
 walk where any honest men resort.
  In 
0
 bed, he slept not for my urging it;
  At 
0
 board, he fed not for my urging it;
  In 
0
 company, I often glanced it;
  It 
0
 seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
  Of 
0
 pale distemperatures and foes to life?
  In 
0
 food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
  To 
0
 be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
  Or 
0
 lose my labour in assaying it.
  To 
0
 make of him a formal man again.
  It 
0
 is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  To 
0
 separate the husband and the wife.
  If 
0
 any friend will pay the sum for him,
  He 
0
 shall not die; so much we tender him.
  It 
0
 cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  At

  By

 Syracuse was I born, and wed
  By 
0
 prosperous voyages I often made
  To 
0
 Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
  As 
0
 could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
  Of 
0
 such a burden, male twins, both alike.
  My 
0
 wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  We 
0
 came aboard.
  My 
0
 wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  To 
0
 him one of the other twins was bound,
  At 
0
 length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
  Of 
0
 Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
  We 
0
 were encount'red by a mighty rock,
  So 
0
 that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  By 
0
 fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  At 
0
 length another ship had seiz'd on us;
  To 
0
 tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
  Do 
0
 me the favour to dilate at full
  At 
0
 eighteen years became inquisitive
  Or 
0
 that or any place that harbours men.
  To 
0
 bear the extremity of dire mishap!
  My 
0
 soul should sue as advocate for thee.
  To 
0
 seek thy help by beneficial hap.
  Is 
0
 apprehended for arrival here;
  Of 
0
 whom I hope to make much benefit;
  My 
0
 present business calls me from you now.
  So 
0
 I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In 
0
 quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
  My 
0
 mistress made it one upon my cheek;
  To 
0
 pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
  We 
0
 being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
  So 
0
 great a charge from thine own custody?
  If 
0
 I return, I shall be post indeed,
  ANTIPHOLUS 
0
TIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
  My 
0
 mistress and her sister stays for you.
  In 
0
 what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
  Or 
0
 I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
  If 
0
 I should pay your worship those again,
  If 
0
 it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
  Of 
0
 more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
  We 
0
 bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
  As 
0
 much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
  So 
0
 thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
  It 
0
 seems he hath great care to please his wife.
  He 
0
 ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
  So 
0
 that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  If 
0
 I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
  If 
0
 voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
  Do 
0
 their gay vestments his affections bait?
  By 
0
 him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
  Of 
0
 my defeatures. My decayed fair
  Or 
0
 else what lets it but he would be here?
  So 
0
 he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
  By 
0
 falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
  Is 
0
 wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
  By 
0
 computation and mine host's report
  As 
0
 you love strokes, so jest with me again.
  My 
0
 house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  Do 
0
 use you for my fool and chat with you,
  If 
0
 you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  Or 
0
 I will beat this method in your sconce.
  Am 
0
 better than thy dear self's better part.
  As 
0
 take from me thyself, and not me too.
  By 
0
 ruffian lust should be contaminate!
  My 
0
 blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
  In 
0
 Ephesus I am but two hours old,
  As 
0
 strange unto your town as to your talk,
  To 
0
 counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
  Be 
0
 it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  If 
0
 aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Or 
0
 sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
  We 
0
 talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
  If 
0
 we obey them not, this will ensue:
  To 
0
 put the finger in the eye and weep,
  My 
0
 wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
  To 
0
 see the making of her carcanet,
  He 
0
 met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
  If 
0
 the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
  By 
0
 the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
  My 
0
 master stays in the street.
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
    -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
  It 
0
 would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
  If 
0
 a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
  Be 
0
 rul'd by me: depart in patience,
  To 
0
 know the reason of this strange restraint.
  If 
0
 by strong hand you offer to break in
  My 
0
 wife-but, I protest, without desert-
  To 
0
 her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  Be 
0
 it for nothing but to spite my wife-
  If 
0
 you did wed my sister for her wealth,
  Be 
0
 not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
  Be 
0
 secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
  We 
0
 in your motion turn, and you may move us.
  To 
0
 make it wander in an unknown field?
  O, 
0
 train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  To 
0
 drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
  He 
0
 gains by death that hath such means to die.
  It 
0
 is thyself, mine own self's better part;
  My 
0
 food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
  My 
0
 sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
  Am 
0
 I your man? Am I myself?
  An 
0
 if the wind blow any way from shore,
  If 
0
 any bark put forth, come to the mart,
  If 
0
 every one knows us, and we know none,
  So 
0
 fly I from her that would be my wife.
  Of 
0
 such enchanting presence and discourse,
  Go 
0
 home with it, and please your wife withal;
  If 
0
 any ship put out, then straight away.
  To 
0
 Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Or 
0
 I'll attach you by this officer.
  Is 
0
 growing to me by Antipholus;
  He 
0
 had of me a chain; at five o'clock
  If 
0
 it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
  Or 
0
 else you may return without your money.
  If 
0
 not, I'll leave him to the officer.
  Or 
0
 I attach you by this officer.
  If 
0
 he should scorn me so apparently.
  As 
0
 all the metal in your shop will answer.
  To 
0
 your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
  To 
0
 Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
  Of 
0
 his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
  My 
0
 tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  He 
0
 is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
  No 
0
 evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  My 
0
 heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  It 
0
 was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
  If 
0
 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
  As 
0
 if I were their well-acquainted friend;
  Is 
0
 that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
  Is 
0
 a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of 
0
 his own doors being shut against his entrance.
  On 
0
 purpose shut the doors against his way.
  My 
0
 way is now to hie home to his house,
  He 
0
 rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My 
0
 ring away. This course I fittest choose,
  To 
0
 warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
  My 
0
 wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
  To 
0
 yield possession to my holy prayers,
  By 
0
 Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
  To 
0
 make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
  To 
0
 make a rescue?
  He 
0
 is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
  Do 
0
 outrage and displeasure to himself?
  Be 
0
 mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
  Of 
0
 credit infinite, highly belov'd,
  To 
0
 walk where any honest men resort.
  In 
0
 bed, he slept not for my urging it;
  At 
0
 board, he fed not for my urging it;
  In 
0
 company, I often glanced it;
  It 
0
 seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
  Of 
0
 pale distemperatures and foes to life?
  In 
0
 food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
  To 
0
 be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
  Or 
0
 lose my labour in assaying it.
  To 
0
 make of him a formal man again.
  It 
0
 is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  To 
0
 separate the husband and the wife.
  If 
0
 any friend will pay the sum for him,
  He 
0
 shall not die; so much we tender him.
  It 
0
 cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  At 
0
 your important letters-this ill day
  By 
0
 rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  He 
0
 broke from those that had the guard of him,
  We 
0
 came again to bind them. Then they fled
  To 
0
 do him all the grace and good I could.
  My 
0
 master and his man are both broke loose,
  My 
0
 master preaches patience to him, and the while
  He 
0
 cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
  To 
0
 scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
  As 
0
 this is false he burdens me withal!
  In 
0
 this the madman justly chargeth them.
  He 
0
 did arrest me with an officer.
  To 
0
 go in person with me to my house.
  By 
0
 th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
  Of 
0
 vile confederates. Along with them
  To 
0
 give me ample satisfaction
  If 
0
 here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
  If 
0
 he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
  In 
0
 seven short years that here my only son
  In 
0
 sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
  My 
0
 wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  My 
0
 dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
  O, 
0
 if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
  If 
0
 thou art she, tell me where is that son
  By 
0
 force took Dromio and my son from them,
  If 
0
 this be not a dream I see and hear.
  By 
0
 Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
  To 
0
 go with us into the abbey here,
  Of 
0
 you, my sons; and till this present hour
  My 
0
 heavy burden ne'er delivered.
  Go 
0
 to a gossips' feast, and go with me;

0
  To 
0
 merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
  It 
0
 hath in solemn synods been decreed,
  To 
0
 admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
  Be 
0
 seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  To 
0
 quit the penalty and to ransom him.
  My 
0
 woes end likewise with the evening sun.

  To 
0
 Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
  As 
0
 could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
  Of 
0
 such a burden, male twins, both alike.
  My 
0
 wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  We 
0
 came aboard.
  My 
0
 wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  To 
0
 him one of the other twins was bound,
  At 
0
 length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
  Of 
0
 Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
  We 
0
 were encount'red by a mighty rock,
  So 
0
 that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  By 
0
 fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  At 
0
 length another ship had seiz'd on us;
  To 
0
 tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
  Do 
0
 me the favour to dilate at full
  At 
0
 eighteen years became inquisitive
  Or 
0
 that or any place that harbours men.
  To 
0
 bear the extremity of dire mishap!
  My 
0
 soul should sue as advocate for thee.
  To 
0
 seek thy help by beneficial hap.
  Is 
0
 apprehended for arrival here;
  Of 
0
 whom I hope to make much benefit;
  My 
0
 present business calls me from you now.
  So 
0
 I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In 
0
 quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
  My 
0
 mistress made it one upon my cheek;
  To 
0
 pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
  We 
0
 being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
  So 
0
 great a charge from thine own custody?
  If 
0
 I return, I shall be post indeed,
  ANTIPHOLUS 
0
TIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
  My 
0
 mistress and her sister stays for you.
  In 
0
 what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
  Or 
0
 I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
  If 
0
 I should pay your worship those again,
  If 
0
 it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
  Of 
0
 more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
  We 
0
 bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
  As 
0
 much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
  So 
0
 thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
  It 
0
 seems he hath great care to please his wife.
  He 
0
 ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
  So 
0
 that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  If 
0
 I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
  If 
0
 voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
  Do 
0
 their gay vestments his affections bait?
  By 
0
 him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
  Of 
0
 my defeatures. My decayed fair
  Or 
0
 else what lets it but he would be here?
  So 
0
 he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
  By 
0
 falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
  Is 
0
 wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
  By 
0
 computation and mine host's report
  As 
0
 you love strokes, so jest with me again.
  My 
0
 house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  Do 
0
 use you for my fool and chat with you,
  If 
0
 you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  Or 
0
 I will beat this method in your sconce.
  Am 
0
 better than thy dear self's better part.
  As 
0
 take from me thyself, and not me too.
  By 
0
 ruffian lust should be contaminate!
  My 
0
 blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
  In 
0
 Ephesus I am but two hours old,
  As 
0
 strange unto your town as to your talk,
  To 
0
 counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
  Be 
0
 it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  If 
0
 aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Or 
0
 sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
  We 
0
 talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
  If 
0
 we obey them not, this will ensue:
  To 
0
 put the finger in the eye and weep,
  My 
0
 wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
  To 
0
 see the making of her carcanet,
  He 
0
 met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
  If 
0
 the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
  By 
0
 the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
  My 
0
 master stays in the street.
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
    -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
  It 
0
 would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
  If 
0
 a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
  Be 
0
 rul'd by me: depart in patience,
  To 
0
 know the reason of this strange restraint.
  If 
0
 by strong hand you offer to break in
  My 
0
 wife-but, I protest, without desert-
  To 
0
 her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  Be 
0
 it for nothing but to spite my wife-
  If 
0
 you did wed my sister for her wealth,
  Be 
0
 not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
  Be 
0
 secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
  We 
0
 in your motion turn, and you may move us.
  To 
0
 make it wander in an unknown field?
  O, 
0
 train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  To 
0
 drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
  He 
0
 gains by death that hath such means to die.
  It 
0
 is thyself, mine own self's better part;
  My 
0
 food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
  My 
0
 sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
  Am 
0
 I your man? Am I myself?
  An 
0
 if the wind blow any way from shore,
  If 
0
 any bark put forth, come to the mart,
  If 
0
 every one knows us, and we know none,
  So 
0
 fly I from her that would be my wife.
  Of 
0
 such enchanting presence and discourse,
  Go 
0
 home with it, and please your wife withal;
  If 
0
 any ship put out, then straight away.
  To 
0
 Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Or 
0
 I'll attach you by this officer.
  Is 
0
 growing to me by Antipholus;
  He 
0
 had of me a chain; at five o'clock
  If 
0
 it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
  Or 
0
 else you may return without your money.
  If 
0
 not, I'll leave him to the officer.
  Or 
0
 I attach you by this officer.
  If 
0
 he should scorn me so apparently.
  As 
0
 all the metal in your shop will answer.
  To 
0
 your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
  To 
0
 Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
  Of 
0
 his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
  My 
0
 tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  He 
0
 is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
  No 
0
 evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  My 
0
 heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  It 
0
 was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
  If 
0
 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
  As 
0
 if I were their well-acquainted friend;
  Is 
0
 that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
  Is 
0
 a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of 
0
 his own doors being shut against his entrance.
  On 
0
 purpose shut the doors against his way.
  My 
0
 way is now to hie home to his house,
  He 
0
 rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My 
0
 ring away. This course I fittest choose,
  To 
0
 warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
  My 
0
 wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
  To 
0
 yield possession to my holy prayers,
  By 
0
 Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
  To 
0
 make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
  To 
0
 make a rescue?
  He 
0
 is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
  Do 
0
 outrage and displeasure to himself?
  Be 
0
 mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
  Of 
0
 credit infinite, highly belov'd,
  To 
0
 walk where any honest men resort.
  In 
0
 bed, he slept not for my urging it;
  At 
0
 board, he fed not for my urging it;
  In 
0
 company, I often glanced it;
  It 
0
 seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
  Of 
0
 pale distemperatures and foes to life?
  In 
0
 food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
  To 
0
 be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
  Or 
0
 lose my labour in assaying it.
  To 
0
 make of him a formal man again.
  It 
0
 is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  To 
0
 separate the husband and the wife.
  If 
0
 any friend will pay the sum for him,
  He 
0
 shall not die; so much we tender him.
  It 
0
 cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  At 
0
 your important letters-this ill day
  By 
0
 rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  He 
0
 broke from those that had the guard of him,
  We 
0
 came again to bind them. Then they fled
  To 
0
 do him all the grace and good I could.
  My 
0
 master and his man are both broke loose,
  My 
0
 master preaches patience to him, and the while
  He 
0
 cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
  To 
0
 scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
  As 
0
 this is false he burdens me withal!
  In 
0
 this the madman justly chargeth them.
  He 
0
 did arrest me with an officer.
  To 
0
 go in person with me to my house.
  By 
0
 th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
  Of 
0
 vile confederates. Along with them
  To 
0
 give me ample satisfaction
  If 
0
 here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
  If 
0
 he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
  In 
0
 seven short years that here my only son
  In 
0
 sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
  My 
0
 wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  My 
0
 dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
  O, 
0
 if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
  If 
0
 thou art she, tell me where is that son
  By 
0
 force took Dromio and my son from them,
  If 
0
 this be not a dream I see and hear.
  By 
0
 Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
  To 
0
 go with us into the abbey here,
  Of 
0
 you, my sons; and till this present hour
  My 
0
 heavy burden ne'er delivered.
  Go 
0
 to a gossips' feast, and go with me;

0
  To 
0
 merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
  It 
0
 hath in solemn synods been decreed,
  To 
0
 admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
  Be 
0
 seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  To 
0
 quit the penalty and to ransom him.
  My 
0
 woes end likewise with the evening sun.
  In 
0
 Syracuse was I born, and wed
  By 
0
 prosperous voyages I often made
  To 
0
 Epidamnum; till my factor's death,

0
 could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
  Of 
0
 such a burden, male twins, both alike.
  My 
0
 wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  We 
0
 came aboard.
  My 
0
 wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  To 
0
 him one of the other twins was bound,
  At 
0
 length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
  Of 
0
 Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
  We 
0
 were encount'red by a mighty rock,
  So 
0
 that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  By 
0
 fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  At 
0
 length another ship had seiz'd on us;
  To 
0
 tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
  Do 
0
 me the favour to dilate at full
  At 
0
 eighteen years became inquisitive
  Or 
0
 that or any place that harbours men.
  To 
0
 bear the extremity of dire mishap!
  My 
0
 soul should sue as advocate for thee.
  To 
0
 seek thy help by beneficial hap.
  Is 
0
 apprehended for arrival here;
  Of 
0
 whom I hope to make much benefit;
  My 
0
 present business calls me from you now.
  So 
0
 I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In 
0
 quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
  My 
0
 mistress made it one upon my cheek;
  To 
0
 pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
  We 
0
 being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
  So 
0
 great a charge from thine own custody?
  If 
0
 I return, I shall be post indeed,
  ANTIPHOLUS 
0
TIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
  My 
0
 mistress and her sister stays for you.
  In 
0
 what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
  Or 
0
 I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
  If 
0
 I should pay your worship those again,
  If 
0
 it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
  Of 
0
 more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
  We 
0
 bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
  As 
0
 much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
  So 
0
 thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
  It 
0
 seems he hath great care to please his wife.
  He 
0
 ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
  So 
0
 that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  If 
0
 I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
  If 
0
 voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
  Do 
0
 their gay vestments his affections bait?
  By 
0
 him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
  Of 
0
 my defeatures. My decayed fair
  Or 
0
 else what lets it but he would be here?
  So 
0
 he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
  By 
0
 falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
  Is 
0
 wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
  By 
0
 computation and mine host's report
  As 
0
 you love strokes, so jest with me again.
  My 
0
 house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  Do 
0
 use you for my fool and chat with you,
  If 
0
 you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  Or 
0
 I will beat this method in your sconce.
  Am 
0
 better than thy dear self's better part.
  As 
0
 take from me thyself, and not me too.
  By 
0
 ruffian lust should be contaminate!
  My 
0
 blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
  In 
0
 Ephesus I am but two hours old,
  As 
0
 strange unto your town as to your talk,
  To 
0
 counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
  Be 
0
 it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  If 
0
 aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Or 
0
 sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
  We 
0
 talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
  If 
0
 we obey them not, this will ensue:
  To 
0
 put the finger in the eye and weep,
  My 
0
 wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
  To 
0
 see the making of her carcanet,
  He 
0
 met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
  If 
0
 the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
  By 
0
 the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
  My 
0
 master stays in the street.
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
  It 
0
 would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
  If 
0
 a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
  Be 
0
 rul'd by me: depart in patience,
  To 
0
 know the reason of this strange restraint.
  If 
0
 by strong hand you offer to break in
  My 
0
 wife-but, I protest, without desert-
  To 
0
 her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  Be 
0
 it for nothing but to spite my wife-
  If 
0
 you did wed my sister for her wealth,
  Be 
0
 not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
  Be 
0
 secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
  We 
0
 in your motion turn, and you may move us.
  To 
0
 make it wander in an unknown field?
  O, 
0
 train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  To 
0
 drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
  He 
0
 gains by death that hath such means to die.
  It 
0
 is thyself, mine own self's better part;
  My 
0
 food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
  My 
0
 sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
  Am 
0
 I your man? Am I myself?
  An 
0
 if the wind blow any way from shore,
  If 
0
 any bark put forth, come to the mart,
  If 
0
 every one knows us, and we know none,
  So 
0
 fly I from her that would be my wife.
  Of 
0
 such enchanting presence and discourse,
  Go 
0
 home with it, and please your wife withal;
  If 
0
 any ship put out, then straight away.
  To 
0
 Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Or 
0
 I'll attach you by this officer.
  Is 
0
 growing to me by Antipholus;
  He 
0
 had of me a chain; at five o'clock
  If 
0
 it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
  Or 
0
 else you may return without your money.
  If 
0
 not, I'll leave him to the officer.
  Or 
0
 I attach you by this officer.
  If 
0
 he should scorn me so apparently.
  As 
0
 all the metal in your shop will answer.
  To 
0
 your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
  To 
0
 Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
  Of 
0
 his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
  My 
0
 tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  He 
0
 is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
  No 
0
 evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  My 
0
 heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  It 
0
 was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
  If 
0
 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
  As 
0
 if I were their well-acquainted friend;
  Is 
0
 that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
  Is 
0
 a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of 
0
 his own doors being shut against his entrance.
  On 
0
 purpose shut the doors against his way.
  My 
0
 way is now to hie home to his house,
  He 
0
 rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My 
0
 ring away. This course I fittest choose,
  To 
0
 warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
  My 
0
 wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
  To 
0
 yield possession to my holy prayers,
  By 
0
 Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
  To 
0
 make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
  To 
0
 make a rescue?
  He 
0
 is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
  Do 
0
 outrage and displeasure to himself?
  Be 
0
 mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
  Of 
0
 credit infinite, highly belov'd,
  To 
0
 walk where any honest men resort.
  In 
0
 bed, he slept not for my urging it;
  At 
0
 board, he fed not for my urging it;
  In 
0
 company, I often glanced it;
  It 
0
 seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
  Of 
0
 pale distemperatures and foes to life?
  In 
0
 food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
  To 
0
 be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
  Or 
0
 lose my labour in assaying it.
  To 
0
 make of him a formal man again.
  It 
0
 is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  To 
0
 separate the husband and the wife.
  If 
0
 any friend will pay the sum for him,
  He 
0
 shall not die; so much we tender him.
  It 
0
 cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  At 
0
 your important letters-this ill day
  By 
0
 rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  He 
0
 broke from those that had the guard of him,
  We 
0
 came again to bind them. Then they fled
  To 
0
 do him all the grace and good I could.
  My 
0
 master and his man are both broke loose,
  My 
0
 master preaches patience to him, and the while
  He 
0
 cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
  To 
0
 scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
  As 
0
 this is false he burdens me withal!
  In 
0
 this the madman justly chargeth them.
  He 
0
 did arrest me with an officer.
  To 
0
 go in person with me to my house.
  By 
0
 th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
  Of 
0
 vile confederates. Along with them
  To 
0
 give me ample satisfaction
  If 
0
 here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
  If 
0
 he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
  In 
0
 seven short years that here my only son
  In 
0
 sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
  My 
0
 wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  My 
0
 dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
  O, 
0
 if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
  If 
0
 thou art she, tell me where is that son
  By 
0
 force took Dromio and my son from them,
  If 
0
 this be not a dream I see and hear.
  By 
0
 Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
  To 
0
 go with us into the abbey here,
  Of 
0
 you, my sons; and till this present hour
  My 
0
 heavy burden ne'er delivered.
  Go 
0
 to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
  To 
0
 merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
  It 
0
 hath in solemn synods been decreed,
  To 
0
 admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
  Be 
0
 seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  To 
0
 quit the penalty and to ransom him.
  My 
0
 woes end likewise with the evening sun.
  In 
0
 Syracuse was I born, and wed
  By 
0
 prosperous voyages I often made
  To 
0
 Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
  As 
0

 him one of the other twins was bound,
  At 
0
 length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
  Of 
0
 Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
  We 
0
 were encount'red by a mighty rock,
  So 
0
 that, in this unjust divorce of us,
  By 
0
 fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
  At 
0
 length another ship had seiz'd on us;
  To 
0
 tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
  Do 
0
 me the favour to dilate at full
  At 
0
 eighteen years became inquisitive
  Or 
0
 that or any place that harbours men.
  To 
0
 bear the extremity of dire mishap!
  My 
0
 soul should sue as advocate for thee.
  To 
0
 seek thy help by beneficial hap.
  Is 
0
 apprehended for arrival here;
  Of 
0
 whom I hope to make much benefit;
  My 
0
 present business calls me from you now.
  So 
0
 I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In 
0
 quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
  My 
0
 mistress made it one upon my cheek;
  To 
0
 pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
  We 
0
 being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
  So 
0
 great a charge from thine own custody?
  If 
0
 I return, I shall be post indeed,
  ANTIPHOLUS 
0
TIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
  My 
0
 mistress and her sister stays for you.
  In 
0
 what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
  Or 
0
 I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
  If 
0
 I should pay your worship those again,
  If 
0
 it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
  Of 
0
 more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
  We 
0
 bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
  As 
0
 much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
  So 
0
 thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
  It 
0
 seems he hath great care to please his wife.
  He 
0
 ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
  So 
0
 that my errand, due unto my tongue,
  If 
0
 I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
  If 
0
 voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
  Do 
0
 their gay vestments his affections bait?
  By 
0
 him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
  Of 
0
 my defeatures. My decayed fair
  Or 
0
 else what lets it but he would be here?
  So 
0
 he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
  By 
0
 falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
  Is 
0
 wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
  By 
0
 computation and mine host's report
  As 
0
 you love strokes, so jest with me again.
  My 
0
 house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
  Do 
0
 use you for my fool and chat with you,
  If 
0
 you will jest with me, know my aspect,
  Or 
0
 I will beat this method in your sconce.
  Am 
0
 better than thy dear self's better part.
  As 
0
 take from me thyself, and not me too.
  By 
0
 ruffian lust should be contaminate!
  My 
0
 blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
  In 
0
 Ephesus I am but two hours old,
  As 
0
 strange unto your town as to your talk,
  To 
0
 counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
  Be 
0
 it my wrong you are from me exempt,
  If 
0
 aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
  Or 
0
 sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
  We 
0
 talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
  If 
0
 we obey them not, this will ensue:
  To 
0
 put the finger in the eye and weep,
  My 
0
 wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
  To 
0
 see the making of her carcanet,
  He 
0
 met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
  If 
0
 the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
  By 
0
 the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
  My 
0
 master stays in the street.
  If 
0
 thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
  It 
0
 would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
  If 
0
 a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
  Be 
0
 rul'd by me: depart in patience,
  To 
0
 know the reason of this strange restraint.
  If 
0
 by strong hand you offer to break in
  My 
0
 wife-but, I protest, without desert-
  To 
0
 her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
  Be 
0
 it for nothing but to spite my wife-
  If 
0
 you did wed my sister for her wealth,
  Be 
0
 not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
  Be 
0
 secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
  We 
0
 in your motion turn, and you may move us.
  To 
0
 make it wander in an unknown field?
  O, 
0
 train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
  To 
0
 drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
  He 
0
 gains by death that hath such means to die.
  It 
0
 is thyself, mine own self's better part;
  My 
0
 food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
  My 
0
 sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
  Am 
0
 I your man? Am I myself?
  An 
0
 if the wind blow any way from shore,
  If 
0
 any bark put forth, come to the mart,
  If 
0
 every one knows us, and we know none,
  So 
0
 fly I from her that would be my wife.
  Of 
0
 such enchanting presence and discourse,
  Go 
0
 home with it, and please your wife withal;
  If 
0
 any ship put out, then straight away.
  To 
0
 Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Or 
0
 I'll attach you by this officer.
  Is 
0
 growing to me by Antipholus;
  He 
0
 had of me a chain; at five o'clock
  If 
0
 it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
  Or 
0
 else you may return without your money.
  If 
0
 not, I'll leave him to the officer.
  Or 
0
 I attach you by this officer.
  If 
0
 he should scorn me so apparently.
  As 
0
 all the metal in your shop will answer.
  To 
0
 your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
  To 
0
 Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
  Of 
0
 his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
  My 
0
 tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
  He 
0
 is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
  No 
0
 evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  My 
0
 heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
  It 
0
 was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
  If 
0
 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
  As 
0
 if I were their well-acquainted friend;
  Is 
0
 that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
  Is 
0
 a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of 
0
 his own doors being shut against his entrance.
  On 
0
 purpose shut the doors against his way.
  My 
0
 way is now to hie home to his house,
  He 
0
 rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My 
0
 ring away. This course I fittest choose,
  To 
0
 warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
  My 
0
 wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
  To 
0
 yield possession to my holy prayers,
  By 
0
 Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
  To 
0
 make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
  To 
0
 make a rescue?
  He 
0
 is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
  Do 
0
 outrage and displeasure to himself?
  Be 
0
 mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
  Of 
0
 credit infinite, highly belov'd,
  To 
0
 walk where any honest men resort.
  In 
0
 bed, he slept not for my urging it;
  At 
0
 board, he fed not for my urging it;
  In 
0
 company, I often glanced it;
  It 
0
 seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
  Of 
0
 pale distemperatures and foes to life?
  In 
0
 food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
  To 
0
 be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
  Or 
0
 lose my labour in assaying it.
  To 
0
 make of him a formal man again.
  It 
0
 is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
  To 
0
 separate the husband and the wife.
  If 
0
 any friend will pay the sum for him,
  He 
0
 shall not die; so much we tender him.
  It 
0
 cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  At 
0
 your important letters-this ill day
  By 
0
 rushing in their houses, bearing thence
  He 
0
 broke from those that had the guard of him,
  We 
0
 came again to bind them. Then they fled
  To 
0
 do him all the grace and good I could.
  My 
0
 master and his man are both broke loose,
  My 
0
 master preaches patience to him, and the while
  He 
0
 cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
  To 
0
 scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
  As 
0
 this is false he burdens me withal!
  In 
0
 this the madman justly chargeth them.
  He 
0
 did arrest me with an officer.
  To 
0
 go in person with me to my house.
  By 
0
 th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
  Of 
0
 vile confederates. Along with them
  To 
0
 give me ample satisfaction
  If 
0
 here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
  If 
0
 he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
  In 
0
 seven short years that here my only son
  In 
0
 sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
  My 
0
 wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
  My 
0
 dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
  O, 
0
 if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
  If 
0
 thou art she, tell me where is that son
  By 
0
 force took Dromio and my son from them,
  If 
0
 this be not a dream I see and hear.
  By 
0
 Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
  To 
0
 go with us into the abbey here,
  Of 
0
 you, my sons; and till this present hour
  My 
0
 heavy burden ne'er delivered.
  Go 
0
 to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
  To 
0
 merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
  It 
0
 hath in solemn synods been decreed,
  To 
0
 admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
  Be 
0
 seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  To 
0
 quit the penalty and to ransom him.
  My 
0
 woes end likewise with the evening sun.
  In 
0
 Syracuse was I born, and wed
  By 
0
 prosperous voyages I often made
  To 
0
 Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
  As 
0
 could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
  Of 
0
 such a burden, male twins, both alike.
  My 
0
 wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
  We 
0
 came aboard.
  My 
0
 wife, more careful for the latter-born,
  To 
0
 him one of the other twins was bound,
  At 
0
