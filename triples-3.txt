Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
    lest he catch cold on's feet.
    an you'll tell me wherefore.
    I have not din'd to-day.
    come again when you may.
    from the house I owe?
    sir, and my name is Dromio.
    office and my name!
    -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
    troubled with unruly boys.
    have come before.
    and I'll break your knave's pate.
    sir; and words are but wind;
    out upon thee, hind!
    feathers and fish have no fin.
    and my heart of steel,
    'a turns back for very fear.
    more than he's worth to season.
