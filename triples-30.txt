    Safe out of Fortune's shot, and sits aloft,
    Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,

    As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
    And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
    Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
    So Tamora.
    Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
    And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
    Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
    To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
    And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long.
    Hast prisoner held, fett'red in amorous chains,
    And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
    Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
    I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,
    To wait upon this new-made emperess.
    To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,
    This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
    This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
    And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.

    No, madam, these are no venereal signs.

    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee-
    This is the day of doom for Bassianus;
    His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
    Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
    And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
    Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,

    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt
  TITUS.

Empress

JUDGES
Lucius
TUS. Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!
    For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
    In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

Lucius

    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
    But me and mine; how happy art thou then
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
  MARCUS.

    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!

AARON
MESSENGER
Lucius
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
    And make them blind with tributary tears.
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.

    And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior and command a camp.

  PUBLIUS.

TITUS
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,

MORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,
    Thy life-blood out; if Aaron now be wise,
    Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.

    Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds.
    May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons
    That died by law for murder of our brother
    Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
    Go drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,
    Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
    In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

2
TITUS
TAMORA
MORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

    To wait upon this new-made emperess.
    To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,
    This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
    This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
    And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
    Hullo! what storm is this?

    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee-
    This is the day of doom for Bassianus;
    His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
    Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
    And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.

    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
  AARON.

MARCUS
AARON
RON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
  AARON. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RON. Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. My hand shall go.
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. By heaven, it shall not go!
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. Then I'll go fetch an axe.
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. But I will use the axe.
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. But I will use the axe.
                                        Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;
  AARON. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
  AARON. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
    And never whilst I live deceive men so;
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
                                       [He cuts off TITUS' hand]
  AARON.

MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RON. I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
  TITUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
  MARCUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RCUS. O brother, speak with possibility,
  TITUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
  MARCUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RCUS. But yet let reason govern thy lament.
  TITUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
  MESSENGER.

MARCUS

RCUS. Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
    And make them blind with tributary tears.
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
                                           Exeunt all but Lucius

  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. O, O, O!
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,

  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS

  TITUS.

TITUS

  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,

2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. Lucius, I will.           [LAVINIA turns over with her
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. For love of her that's gone,
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS

LUCIUS
TUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.

1
AARON
METRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
    You may be armed and appointed well.
    And so I leave you both-  [Aside]  like bloody villains.

1
AARON
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS.

AARON

  AARON.

AARON
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON
METRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  CHIRON.

AARON
IRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
  AARON.

AARON

  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON.

  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A devil.
  AARON.

AARON
NURSE

2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!

AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE

2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON.

AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE

  AARON. 
2
AARON

  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,

    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior and command a camp.

  PUBLIUS.

TITUS
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

2
TITUS
CLOWN
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a

2
TITUS
CLOWN

    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,
    Thy life-blood out; if Aaron now be wise,

  SATURNINUS.

AEMILIUS
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
    Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds.
    May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons
    That died by law for murder of our brother
    Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
    Go drag the villain hither by the hair;

    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand

1
MARCUS
RCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

    For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
    In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,

2
TITUS
LUCIUS

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  MARCUS.

  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,

  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
    You may be armed and appointed well.
    And so I leave you both-  [Aside]  like bloody villains.

  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON

  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS.

AARON
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
  DEMETRIUS.

AARON
NURSE

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE
RSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A devil.
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE
RON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I

AARON

  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON

AARON
NURSE

2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON.

AARON
NURSE
IRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:

AARON
NURSE
RSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  DEMETRIUS.

AARON
NURSE

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. How many women saw this child of his?
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,

AARON
NURSE

    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
         Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, bearing off the dead NURSE

NURSE
RON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior and command a camp.

TITUS

  MARCUS.

  TITUS.

  PUBLIUS. 
1
TITUS
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,

  MARCUS.

2
TITUS
CLOWN

  CLOWN. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN
OWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

2
TITUS
CLOWN
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
  CLOWN. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN

CLOWN
MORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,
    Thy life-blood out; if Aaron now be wise,
    Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.
  CLOWN.

  TAMORA. 
1
CLOWN
MORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
  CLOWN. 
1
CLOWN
OWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
  SATURNINUS. 
1
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AEMILIUS
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
    Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds.
    May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons
    That died by law for murder of our brother
    Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
    Go drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,
    Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
    In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

AEMILIUS
CLOWN
MILIUS. Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
  SATURNINUS.

AEMILIUS
CLOWN

AEMILIUS
CLOWN
MORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  SATURNINUS.

AEMILIUS
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,

AEMILIUS
CLOWN

AEMILIUS
CLOWN

  TITUS.

TAMORA
TUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?
  TAMORA.

TAMORA

  TITUS.

  TAMORA. 
1
TAMORA
MORA. If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
  TITUS. 
1
TAMORA
TUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
  TAMORA. 
1
TAMORA
MORA. Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
  TITUS. 
1
TAMORA

  TAMORA. 
1

  TITUS.

  TAMORA. 
2
TITUS
TAMORA
MORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
  TITUS.

  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

MARCUS
TUS. Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!
    For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
    In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

MARCUS
CIUS. O noble father, you lament in vain;
  TITUS. 
1

TUS. Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. To rescue my two brothers from their death;
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
    But me and mine; how happy art thou then
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. This was thy daughter.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Why, Marcus, so she is.
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. Ay me! this object kills me.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS

  TITUS.

MARCUS
TUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!

AARON

2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON

  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. But I will use the axe.

  AARON. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
    And never whilst I live deceive men so;
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.

MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,

4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
    And make them blind with tributary tears.
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.

    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,

    I know from whence this same device proceeds.
    May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons
    That died by law for murder of our brother
    Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
    Go drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,

TAMORA
MORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

AARON
RON. Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
    Safe out of Fortune's shot, and sits aloft,
    Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,
    Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach.
    As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
    And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
    Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
    So Tamora.
    Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
    And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
    Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
    To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
    And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long.
    Hast prisoner held, fett'red in amorous chains,
    And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
    Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
    I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,
    To wait upon this new-made emperess.
    To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,
    This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
    This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
    And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
    Hullo! what storm is this?

    Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
    Which, cunningly effected, will beget

    What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
    My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
    My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
    Even as an adder when she doth unroll
    To do some fatal execution?
    No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
    Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee-
    This is the day of doom for Bassianus;
    His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
    Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
    And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
    Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,

    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

    In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

MARCUS
CIUS. O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARCUS
CIUS. Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
  AARON. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
  AARON. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RON. Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. My hand shall go.
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. By heaven, it shall not go!
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  LUCIUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
CIUS. Then I'll go fetch an axe.
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. But I will use the axe.
  MARCUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RCUS. But I will use the axe.
                                        Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
  TITUS. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
TUS. Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;
  AARON. 
2
MARCUS
AARON
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
  AARON. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
    And never whilst I live deceive men so;
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
                                       [He cuts off TITUS' hand]
  AARON. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RON. I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
  TITUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
  MARCUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RCUS. O brother, speak with possibility,
  TITUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
  MARCUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
RCUS. But yet let reason govern thy lament.
  TITUS. 
3
MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
  MESSENGER.

MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
SSENGER. Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
  MARCUS.

MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
RCUS. Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
  LUCIUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
CIUS. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
  MARCUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
RCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS

  MARCUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS

  TITUS.

MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS

  MARCUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
RCUS. Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
    And make them blind with tributary tears.
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
                                           Exeunt all but Lucius
  LUCIUS.

1
TITUS
TUS. How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
  BOY. 
1
TITUS
Y. Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. O, O, O!
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. Lucius, I will.           [LAVINIA turns over with her
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. I think she means that there were more than one
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. For love of her that's gone,
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
  MARCUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS

2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;

Y. I say, my lord, that if I were a man

  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
    Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house.
    Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court;
    Ay, marry, will we, sir! and we'll be waited on.

AARON
RON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y. My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON
METRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
    You may be armed and appointed well.
    And so I leave you both-  [Aside]  like bloody villains.

  DEMETRIUS.

AARON

  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON
METRIUS. But me more good to see so great a lord
  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON
METRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  CHIRON. 
1
AARON
IRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
  CHIRON. 
1
AARON
IRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
1
AARON
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
AARON

AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE
RSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A devil.
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
  AARON.

AARON
NURSE
RON. Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
  DEMETRIUS.

AARON
NURSE

NURSE
RON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I

  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE

  NURSE.

AARON
NURSE

2
AARON
NURSE

  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE

  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,

AARON
NURSE

    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
         Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, bearing off the dead NURSE
  AARON.

AARON

NURSE
RON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior and command a camp.

RCUS. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
  TITUS.

  PUBLIUS. 
1
TITUS
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,

  MARCUS.

TITUS
CLOWN

  CLOWN. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN
OWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

2
TITUS
CLOWN
RCUS. Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
  CLOWN. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN

    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,
    Thy life-blood out; if Aaron now be wise,
    Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.

    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand

1
MARCUS
RCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
    Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery!                Exeunt

    For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
    In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
                          [ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
    But me and mine; how happy art thou then
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
  MARCUS. 
1

  LUCIUS.

RCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her
  MARCUS. 
1
MARCUS
RCUS. Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
  TITUS. 
1
MARCUS
TUS. If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,

    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!

AARON
LUCIUS

    And never whilst I live deceive men so;
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.

MARCUS
AARON
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
  TITUS. 
4
MARCUS
AARON
MESSENGER
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you

    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,

  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
  MARCUS. 
1
TITUS
RCUS. Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. O, O, O!

2
TITUS
LUCIUS

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.

TITUS

  BOY. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;

TITUS
LUCIUS

  TITUS. 
2
TITUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,

AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  BOY. 
1
AARON
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
    You may be armed and appointed well.
    And so I leave you both-  [Aside]  like bloody villains.

1
AARON
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS.

AARON
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.

AARON

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON.

  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A devil.
  AARON.

AARON
NURSE

2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!

AARON
NURSE

AARON
NURSE
RON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I

AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
  DEMETRIUS.

AARON
NURSE

  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
RON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
  NURSE. 
2
AARON
NURSE

2
AARON
NURSE
RON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON. 
2
AARON
NURSE

  CHIRON. 
2
AARON
NURSE
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
2
AARON
NURSE
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,

    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior and command a camp.

  TITUS.

  PUBLIUS.

TITUS
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,

  CLOWN. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

TITUS
CLOWN

2
TITUS
CLOWN

  CLOWN. 
2
TITUS
CLOWN

CLOWN
MORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.  [Aside]  Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all.
    But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick,
    Thy life-blood out; if Aaron now be wise,
    Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.

1
CLOWN
MORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
  CLOWN. 
1
CLOWN
OWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
  SATURNINUS. 
1
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AEMILIUS
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
    Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds.
    May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons
    That died by law for murder of our brother
    Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
    Go drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege.
    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,
    Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
    In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

AEMILIUS
CLOWN
MILIUS. Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
  SATURNINUS.

AEMILIUS
CLOWN

AEMILIUS
CLOWN
MORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AEMILIUS
CLOWN
TURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,

AEMILIUS
CLOWN

AEMILIUS
CLOWN

    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

VINIA. O, let me teach thee! For my father's sake,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
  LAVINIA. 
0
VINIA. O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.
  LAVINIA. 
0
VINIA. 'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee;
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
  LAVINIA. 
0
VINIA. No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Farewell, my sons; see that you make her sure.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Come on, my lords, the better foot before;
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. And mine, I promise you; were it not for shame,
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this,
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood,
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
  QUINTUS. 
0
INTUS. Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Along with me! I'll see what hole is here,
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
  MARTIUS. 
0
RTIUS. We know not where you left them all alive;
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Where is my lord the King?
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Here, Tamora; though griev'd with killing grief.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Where is thy brother Bassianus?
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound;
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
  AARON. 
0
RON. My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS.  [To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. If it be prov'd! You see it is apparent.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Andronicus himself did take it up.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Andronicus, I will entreat the King.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.     Exeunt
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O noble father, you lament in vain;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. To rescue my two brothers from their death;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This was thy daughter.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, Marcus, so she is.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ay me! this object kills me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
  AARON. 
0
RON. Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. My hand shall go.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. By heaven, it shall not go!
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Then I'll go fetch an axe.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. But I will use the axe.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
  AARON. 
0
RON. I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O brother, speak with possibility,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. But yet let reason govern thy lament.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. When will this fearful slumber have an end?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ha, ha, ha!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. So so, now sit; and look you eat no more
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
  BOY. 
0
Y. Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O, O, O!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;
  BOY. 
0
Y. Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  BOY. 
0
Y. Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  BOY. 
0
Y. My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Lucius, I will.           [LAVINIA turns over with her
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. I think she means that there were more than one
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  BOY. 
0
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. For love of her that's gone,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Magni Dominator poli,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, calm thee, gentle lord! although I know
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;
  BOY. 
0
Y. I say, my lord, that if I were a man
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
  BOY. 
0
Y. And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, go with me into mine armoury.
  BOY. 
0
Y. Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
  BOY. 
0
Y. My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  BOY. 
0
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well;
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. But me more good to see so great a lord
  AARON. 
0
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Soft! who comes here?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Good morrow, lords.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
  AARON. 
0
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A devil.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Villain, what hast thou done?
  AARON. 
0
RON. That which thou canst not undo.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Thou hast undone our mother.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Villain, I have done thy mother.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. It shall not live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. It shall not die.
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
  AARON. 
0
RON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
  AARON. 
0
RON. My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. How many women saw this child of his?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;
  AARON. 
0
RON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON. 
0
RON. O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Now, masters, draw.  [They shoot]  O, well said, Lucius!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ha! ha!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, there it goes! God give his lordship joy!
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, sir.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. God be with you, sir; I will.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.     Exeunt
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. 'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Go take him away, and hang him presently.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. How much money must I have?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. But he will not entreat his son for us.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If Tamora entreat him, then he will;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Aemilius, do this message honourably;
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Your bidding shall I do effectually.            Exit
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Now will I to that old Andronicus,
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Then go successantly, and plead to him.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
  FIRST 
0
RST GOTH. Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
  ALL 
0
L THE GOTHS. And as he saith, so say we all with him.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
  SECOND 
0
COND GOTH. Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
  AARON. 
0
RON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Lucius, save the child,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
  AARON. 
0
RON. An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
  AARON. 
0
RON. What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
  AARON. 
0
RON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
  GOTH. 
0
TH. What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die
  AARON. 
0
RON. If there be devils, would I were a devil,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
  GOTH. 
0
TH. My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Let him come near.
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths,
  FIRST 
0
RST GOTH. What says our general?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges

MORA. Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Do me some service ere I come to thee.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. These are my ministers, and come with me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Rape and Murder; therefore called so
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are!
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This will I do, and soon return again.            Exit
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Now will I hence about thy business,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA.  [Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? Will you abide
  TITUS. 
0
TUS.  [Aside]  I knew them all, though they suppos'd me mad,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Farewell, Andronicus, Revenge now goes
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. What is your will?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Know you these two?
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons.
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. And therefore do we what we are commanded.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Some devil whisper curses in my ear,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. What boots it thee to can thyself a sun?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Rome's Emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Marcus, we will.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Welcome, my lord; welcome, dread Queen;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Because I would be sure to have all well
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. It was, Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Your reason, mighty lord.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Because the girl should not survive her shame,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Will't please you eat?  Will't please your Highness feed?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
  MARCUS.

MARTIUS
PTAIN. Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword
    And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
  TITUS. 
1
MARTIUS
TUS. Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARTIUS
CIUS. Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
  TITUS. 
1
MARTIUS
TUS. I give him you- the noblest that survives,
  TAMORA. 
1
MARTIUS
MORA. Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,
  TITUS. 
1
MARTIUS
TUS. Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
  LUCIUS. 
1
MARTIUS
CIUS. Away with him, and make a fire straight;

1
MARTIUS
CIUS. Away with him, and make a fire straight;
    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
                                Exeunt TITUS' SONS, with ALARBUS
  TAMORA.

MARTIUS
MORA. O cruel, irreligious piety!
  CHIRON.

  DEMETRIUS.

  DEMETRIUS. 
2
MARTIUS
LUCIUS
METRIUS. Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
    Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen-
    To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
  LUCIUS.

MARTIUS

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TURNINUS. Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go.
  BASSIANUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
SSIANUS. Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal

3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
CIUS. And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.
  TITUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?
  SATURNINUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TURNINUS. Surpris'd! By whom?
  BASSIANUS. 
3
MARTIUS

3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
CIUS. My lord, you are unjust, and more than so:
  TITUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;
  TITUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;
    My sons would never so dishonour me.
  LUCIUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
CIUS. Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
  SATURNINUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TURNINUS. No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not,
  TITUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
  SATURNINUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TURNINUS. But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
  TITUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. These words are razors to my wounded heart.
  SATURNINUS. 
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TURNINUS. And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
  TAMORA.

LUCIUS
TUS, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
    Dishonoured thus, and challenged of wrongs?

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
  TITUS.

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-
  LUCIUS.

MARCUS
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
CIUS. But let us give him burial, as becomes;
  TITUS.

SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. 'And shall!' What villain was it spake that word?
  QUINTUS. 
4

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

MARCUS
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
INTUS. Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
  MARCUS. 
4
MARCUS
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
RCUS. Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-
  QUINTUS.

MARCUS
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
INTUS. Father, and in that name doth nature speak-
  TITUS.

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
  MARCUS.

  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Why mak'st thou it so strange?
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Then why should he despair that knows to court it

0
RON. Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Ay, so the turn were served.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Aaron, thou hast hit it.
  AARON. 
0

  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Faith, not me.

0
METRIUS. Nor me, so I were one.

SATURNINUS
TUS. The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
    The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green.
    Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,
    And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
    And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal,
    That all the court may echo with the noise.
    Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
    To attend the Emperor's person carefully.
    I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
    But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.
         Here a cry of hounds, and wind horns in a peal.

MORA. Saucy controller of my private steps!

SSIANUS. Believe me, Queen, your swarth Cimmerian
  LAVINIA.

  BASSIANUS.

0
CIUS. My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
  TITUS.

CIUS. To rescue my two brothers from their death;
  TITUS.

TUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
  TITUS.

RCUS. This was thy daughter.
  TITUS.

RCUS. O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief

  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. By heaven, it shall not go!
  TITUS.

RCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. Then I'll go fetch an axe.
  MARCUS.

LUCIUS
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,

  MARCUS.

SSENGER. Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid

CIUS. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
  MARCUS.

LUCIUS
RCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
  TITUS.

METRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  BOY.

RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. But me more good to see so great a lord
  AARON. 
0
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?

IRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Soft! who comes here?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Good morrow, lords.
  AARON.

RSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
  NURSE.

RSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
  AARON.

RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A devil.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Villain, what hast thou done?
  AARON. 
0
RON. That which thou canst not undo.
  CHIRON.

RON. Villain, I have done thy mother.
  DEMETRIUS.

IRON. It shall not live.
  AARON.

  AARON.

METRIUS. Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
  AARON. 
0
RON. My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE.

RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON.

  NURSE.

  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,

RON. O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Now, masters, draw.  [They shoot]  O, well said, Lucius!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ha! ha!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, there it goes! God give his lordship joy!
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, sir.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. God be with you, sir; I will.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.     Exeunt
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. 'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Go take him away, and hang him presently.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. How much money must I have?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. But he will not entreat his son for us.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If Tamora entreat him, then he will;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Aemilius, do this message honourably;
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Your bidding shall I do effectually.            Exit
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Now will I to that old Andronicus,
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Then go successantly, and plead to him.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
  FIRST 
0
RST GOTH. Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
  ALL 
0
L THE GOTHS. And as he saith, so say we all with him.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
  SECOND 
0
COND GOTH. Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
  AARON. 
0
RON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Lucius, save the child,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
  AARON. 
0
RON. An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
  AARON. 
0
RON. What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
  AARON. 
0
RON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
  GOTH. 
0
TH. What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die
  AARON. 
0
RON. If there be devils, would I were a devil,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
  GOTH. 
0
TH. My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Let him come near.
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths,
  FIRST 
0
RST GOTH. What says our general?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Do me some service ere I come to thee.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. These are my ministers, and come with me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Rape and Murder; therefore called so
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are!
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This will I do, and soon return again.            Exit
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Now will I hence about thy business,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA.  [Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? Will you abide
  TITUS. 
0
TUS.  [Aside]  I knew them all, though they suppos'd me mad,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Farewell, Andronicus, Revenge now goes
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. What is your will?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Know you these two?
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons.
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. And therefore do we what we are commanded.
  PUBLIUS. 
1
TITUS
BLIUS. And therefore do we what we are commanded.
    Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
    Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.

0
CIUS. Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,

0
RON. Some devil whisper curses in my ear,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. What boots it thee to can thyself a sun?

RCUS. Rome's Emperor, and nephew, break the parle;

  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Welcome, my lord; welcome, dread Queen;
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Because I would be sure to have all well
  TAMORA. 
1
TITUS
MORA. We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. It was, Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Your reason, mighty lord.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Because the girl should not survive her shame,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Will't please you eat?  Will't please your Highness feed?
  TAMORA. 
1
TITUS
MORA. Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
  LUCIUS.

TITUS
RCUS. You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,

Y. O grandsire, grandsire! ev'n with all my heart

    O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
    My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.

PTAIN. Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword

    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen-

RCUS. Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay

0
TUS. How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
  BOY. 
0
Y. Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O, O, O!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;
  BOY. 
0
Y. Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  BOY. 
0
Y. Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  BOY. 
0
Y. My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Lucius, I will.           [LAVINIA turns over with her
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. I think she means that there were more than one
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  BOY. 
0
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. For love of her that's gone,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Magni Dominator poli,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, calm thee, gentle lord! although I know
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;
  BOY.

Y. I say, my lord, that if I were a man
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
  BOY. 
0
Y. And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, go with me into mine armoury.
  BOY. 
0
Y. Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
  BOY. 
0
Y. My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  BOY. 
0
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well;
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. But me more good to see so great a lord
  AARON. 
0
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Soft! who comes here?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Good morrow, lords.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
  AARON. 
0
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A devil.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Villain, what hast thou done?
  AARON. 
0
RON. That which thou canst not undo.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Thou hast undone our mother.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Villain, I have done thy mother.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. It shall not live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. It shall not die.
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
  AARON. 
0
RON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
  AARON. 
0
RON. My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. How many women saw this child of his?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;
  AARON. 
0
RON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON. 
0
RON. O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Now, masters, draw.  [They shoot]  O, well said, Lucius!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ha! ha!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, there it goes! God give his lordship joy!
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all

0
TUS. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, sir.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.

TURNINUS. Go take him away, and hang him presently.
  CLOWN.

OWN. How much money must I have?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. But he will not entreat his son for us.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If Tamora entreat him, then he will;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Aemilius, do this message honourably;
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Your bidding shall I do effectually.            Exit
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Now will I to that old Andronicus,

0
TURNINUS. Then go successantly, and plead to him.

COND GOTH. Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
  AARON. 
0
RON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Lucius, save the child,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
  AARON. 
0
RON. An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
  AARON. 
0
RON. What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
  AARON. 
0
RON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?

RON. Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas

  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die
  AARON.

RON. If there be devils, would I were a devil,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
  GOTH.

MORA. Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Who doth molest my contemplation?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Do me some service ere I come to thee.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. These are my ministers, and come with me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Rape and Murder; therefore called so
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are!
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
  TITUS.

TUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
  TITUS.

METRIUS. Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.

TITUS
TURNINUS. It was, Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Your reason, mighty lord.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Because the girl should not survive her shame,

1
TITUS
TUS. A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind.
  SATURNINUS.

TITUS
TURNINUS. What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS

  TAMORA.

  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
  SATURNINUS.

MARTIUS
PTAIN. Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword
    And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
  TITUS.

    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.

MARTIUS
LUCIUS
METRIUS. Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
    Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen-
    To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
TUS. Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;

AARON
RTIUS. Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
  QUINTUS. 
1
AARON
INTUS. I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
  MARTIUS. 
1
AARON
RTIUS. To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
  QUINTUS. 
1
AARON
INTUS. Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
  MARTIUS. 
1
AARON
RTIUS. Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood,
  QUINTUS. 
1
AARON
INTUS. If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
  MARTIUS. 
1
AARON
RTIUS. Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
  QUINTUS. 
1
AARON
INTUS. Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,
  MARTIUS. 
1
AARON
RTIUS. Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
  QUINTUS. 
1
AARON
INTUS. Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
  SATURNINUS. 
1
AARON
TURNINUS. Along with me! I'll see what hole is here,
  MARTIUS. 
1
AARON
RTIUS. The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
  SATURNINUS. 
1
AARON
TURNINUS. My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
  MARTIUS. 
1
AARON
RTIUS. We know not where you left them all alive;
  MARTIUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
RTIUS. We know not where you left them all alive;
    But, out alas! here have we found him dead.
  TAMORA. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
MORA. Where is my lord the King?
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
TURNINUS. Here, Tamora; though griev'd with killing grief.
  TAMORA. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
MORA. Where is thy brother Bassianus?
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
TURNINUS. Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound;
  TAMORA.

AARON
TAMORA
MORA. Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
  AARON. 
2
AARON
TAMORA

AARON
TAMORA
TURNINUS.  [To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody
  TAMORA.

AARON
TAMORA

  TITUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
TUS. High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
TURNINUS. If it be prov'd! You see it is apparent.
  TAMORA. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
MORA. Andronicus himself did take it up.
  TITUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
TUS. I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail;
  SATURNINUS. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
TURNINUS. Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.
  TAMORA. 
2
AARON
TAMORA
MORA. Andronicus, I will entreat the King.
  TITUS.

AARON
TAMORA

  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O noble father, you lament in vain;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. To rescue my two brothers from their death;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This was thy daughter.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, Marcus, so she is.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ay me! this object kills me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. It was my dear, and he that wounded her
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
  AARON. 
0
RON. Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. My hand shall go.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. By heaven, it shall not go!
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Then I'll go fetch an axe.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. But I will use the axe.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
  AARON. 
1
LUCIUS
RON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
    And never whilst I live deceive men so;
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
                                       [He cuts off TITUS' hand]
  AARON. 
1
LUCIUS
RON. I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
  MARCUS. 
1
LUCIUS
RCUS. O brother, speak with possibility,
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
  MARCUS. 
1
LUCIUS
RCUS. But yet let reason govern thy lament.
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
  MESSENGER. 
1
LUCIUS
SSENGER. Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
  MARCUS. 
1
LUCIUS
RCUS. Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
  MARCUS. 
1
LUCIUS
RCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. When will this fearful slumber have an end?
  MARCUS. 
1
LUCIUS
RCUS. Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. Ha, ha, ha!
  MARCUS. 
1
LUCIUS
RCUS. Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
  TITUS. 
1
LUCIUS
TUS. Why, I have not another tear to shed;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. So so, now sit; and look you eat no more
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
  BOY. 
0
Y. Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. O, O, O!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;
  BOY. 
0
Y. Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  BOY. 
0
Y. Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  BOY. 
0
Y. My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Lucius, I will.           [LAVINIA turns over with her
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. I think she means that there were more than one
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  BOY. 
0
Y. Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. For love of her that's gone,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, why should nature build so foul a den,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Magni Dominator poli,
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O, calm thee, gentle lord! although I know
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;

Y. I say, my lord, that if I were a man

RCUS. Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
  BOY.

Y. And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, go with me into mine armoury.
  BOY.

Y. Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
  BOY. 
0
Y. My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  BOY. 
0
Y.  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well;
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. But me more good to see so great a lord
  AARON. 
0
RON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
  AARON. 
0
RON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Soft! who comes here?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Good morrow, lords.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
  AARON. 
0
RON. To whom?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A devil.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Villain, what hast thou done?
  AARON. 
0
RON. That which thou canst not undo.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Thou hast undone our mother.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Villain, I have done thy mother.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. It shall not live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. It shall not die.
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
  AARON. 
0
RON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
  AARON. 
0
RON. My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. How many women saw this child of his?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
  NURSE. 
0
RSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;
  AARON. 
0
RON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  AARON. 
0
RON. O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
  CHIRON. 
0
IRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. For this care of Tamora,
  AARON. 
0
RON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
  PUBLIUS. 
0
BLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Now, masters, draw.  [They shoot]  O, well said, Lucius!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Ha! ha!
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, there it goes! God give his lordship joy!
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
  MARCUS. 
0
RCUS. Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Ay, sir.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
  TITUS. 
0
TUS. Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.
  CLOWN.

OWN. Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.

OWN. 'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have

TURNINUS. Go take him away, and hang him presently.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. How much money must I have?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. But he will not entreat his son for us.
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. If Tamora entreat him, then he will;
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Aemilius, do this message honourably;
  AEMILIUS. 
0
MILIUS. Your bidding shall I do effectually.            Exit
  TAMORA. 
0
MORA. Now will I to that old Andronicus,
  SATURNINUS. 
0
TURNINUS. Then go successantly, and plead to him.
  LUCIUS.

  SECOND

COND GOTH. Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
  AARON. 
0
RON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Lucius, save the child,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
  AARON. 
0
RON. An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  AARON. 
0
RON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
  AARON. 
0
RON. What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
  AARON. 
0
RON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
  AARON. 
0
RON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
  LUCIUS.

  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
  AARON. 
0
RON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die
  AARON.

CIUS. Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.

TUS. Because I would be sure to have all well
  TAMORA. 
1
TITUS
MORA. We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.

TITUS
TURNINUS. It was, Andronicus.
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. Your reason, mighty lord.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Because the girl should not survive her shame,
  TITUS. 
1
TITUS
TUS. A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?

1
TITUS
TUS. Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
  SATURNINUS. 
1
TITUS
TURNINUS. Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
