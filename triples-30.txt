Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword
    And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.

Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,

Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.

Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive

    Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen-
    To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

LUCIUS
My lord, you are unjust, and more than so:
TITUS
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;
TITUS
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;
    My sons would never so dishonour me.
LUCIUS
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
SATURNINUS
3
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not,
TITUS

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS
LUCIUS
O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
SATURNINUS

MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.

MARCUS
MARTIUS
SATURNINUS

Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-

The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
    The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green.
    Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,
    And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
    And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal,
    That all the court may echo with the noise.
    Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
    To attend the Emperor's person carefully.
    I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
    But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.

Who have we here? Rome's royal Emperess,

Saucy controller of my private steps!
LAVINIA

Under your patience, gentle Emperess,

Believe me, Queen, your swarth Cimmerian
LAVINIA

And, being intercepted in your sport,
BASSIANUS

The King my brother shall have notice of this.
LAVINIA

Ay, for these slips have made him noted long.
TAMORA

Why, I have patience to endure all this.
DEMETRIUS

How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
TAMORA

This is a witness that I am thy son.

'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark.

O, let me teach thee! For my father's sake,

What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.
LAVINIA

'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more,

Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.

No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,

O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
AARON

AARON
 [Aside]  Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
MARTIUS
1
AARON
Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
QUINTUS
1
AARON
I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
MARTIUS

AARON
To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
QUINTUS

AARON
Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
MARTIUS

AARON
Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood,

AARON
The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,

My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:

Where is thy brother Bassianus?
SATURNINUS

Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound;

Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,

My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.

Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,

See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
CHIRON
0
Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
DEMETRIUS
0
She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
CHIRON

An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.
DEMETRIUS
0
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
MARCUS

Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
TITUS

Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!
LUCIUS

O noble father, you lament in vain;
TITUS

Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
LUCIUS

My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
TITUS

Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,

To rescue my two brothers from their death;
TITUS
0
O happy man! they have befriended thee.

Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,

Will it consume me? Let me see it then.

This was thy daughter.

0
Why, Marcus, so she is.
LUCIUS
0
Ay me! this object kills me.
TITUS
0
Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
LUCIUS
0
Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
MARCUS
0
O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
LUCIUS
0
O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
MARCUS
0
O, thus I found her straying in the park,
TITUS
0
It was my dear, and he that wounded her
MARCUS
0
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
TITUS
0
If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
LUCIUS
0
Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
MARCUS
0
Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
TITUS
0
Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
LUCIUS
0
Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
TITUS
0
Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
AARON
0
Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
TITUS
0
O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
LUCIUS
0
Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
MARCUS
0
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
AARON
0
Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
MARCUS
0
My hand shall go.
LUCIUS
0
By heaven, it shall not go!
TITUS
0
Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
LUCIUS
0
Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
MARCUS
0
And for our father's sake and mother's care,
TITUS
0
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
LUCIUS
0
Then I'll go fetch an axe.
MARCUS
0
But I will use the axe.
TITUS
0
Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;
AARON
0
 [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
AARON
1
LUCIUS
 [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
    And never whilst I live deceive men so;
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
                                       [He cuts off TITUS' hand]
AARON
1
LUCIUS
I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
TITUS
1
LUCIUS
O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
MARCUS
1
LUCIUS
O brother, speak with possibility,
TITUS
1
LUCIUS
Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
MARCUS
1
LUCIUS
But yet let reason govern thy lament.
TITUS
1
LUCIUS
If there were reason for these miseries,
MESSENGER
1
LUCIUS
Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
MARCUS
1
LUCIUS
Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
MARCUS
1
LUCIUS
Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
TITUS
1
LUCIUS
When will this fearful slumber have an end?
MARCUS
1
LUCIUS
Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
TITUS
1
LUCIUS
Ha, ha, ha!
MARCUS
1
LUCIUS
Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
TITUS
1
LUCIUS
Why, I have not another tear to shed;
LUCIUS
0
Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
TITUS
0
So so, now sit; and look you eat no more
MARCUS
0
Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay
TITUS
0
How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
BOY
0
Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;
MARCUS
0
Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
TITUS
0
Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
MARCUS
0
At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
TITUS
0
Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
MARCUS
0
Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
TITUS
0
'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
MARCUS
0
Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
TITUS
0
O, O, O!
MARCUS
0
Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
TITUS
0
Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;
BOY
0
Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
MARCUS
0
Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
TITUS
0
She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
BOY
0
Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
MARCUS
0
What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
TITUS
0
Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
MARCUS
0
Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
BOY
0
My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
MARCUS
0
Lucius, I will.           [LAVINIA turns over with her
TITUS
0
How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
MARCUS
0
I think she means that there were more than one
TITUS
0
Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
BOY
0
Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
MARCUS
0
For love of her that's gone,
TITUS
0
Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
MARCUS
0
See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
TITUS
0
Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
MARCUS
0
O, why should nature build so foul a den,
TITUS
0
Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
MARCUS
0
Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
TITUS
0
'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
MARCUS
0
What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
TITUS
0
Magni Dominator poli,
MARCUS
0
O, calm thee, gentle lord! although I know
TITUS
0
'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;
BOY
0
I say, my lord, that if I were a man
MARCUS
0
Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
BOY
0
And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
TITUS
0
Come, go with me into mine armoury.
BOY
0
Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
TITUS
0
No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
MARCUS
0
O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
CHIRON
0
Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
AARON
0
Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
BOY
0
My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
DEMETRIUS
0
Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
BOY
0
 [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
DEMETRIUS
0
What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
CHIRON
0
O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well;
AARON
0
Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
DEMETRIUS
0
But me more good to see so great a lord
AARON
0
Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
DEMETRIUS
0
I would we had a thousand Roman dames
CHIRON
0
A charitable wish and full of love.
AARON
0
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
CHIRON
0
And that would she for twenty thousand more.
DEMETRIUS
0
Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
AARON
0
 [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
DEMETRIUS
0
Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
CHIRON
0
Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
DEMETRIUS
0
Soft! who comes here?
NURSE
0
Good morrow, lords.
AARON
0
Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
NURSE
0
O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
AARON
0
Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
NURSE
0
O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
AARON
0
To whom?
NURSE
0
I mean she is brought a-bed.
AARON
0
Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
NURSE
0
A devil.
AARON
0
Why, then she is the devil's dam;
NURSE
0
A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
AARON
0
Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
DEMETRIUS
0
Villain, what hast thou done?
AARON
0
That which thou canst not undo.
CHIRON
0
Thou hast undone our mother.
AARON
0
Villain, I have done thy mother.
DEMETRIUS
0
And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
CHIRON
0
It shall not live.
AARON
0
It shall not die.
NURSE
0
Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
AARON
0
What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
DEMETRIUS
0
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
AARON
0
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
DEMETRIUS
0
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
AARON
0
My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
DEMETRIUS
0
By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
CHIRON
0
Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
NURSE
0
The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
CHIRON
0
I blush to think upon this ignomy.
AARON
0
Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
NURSE
0
Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
DEMETRIUS
0
Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
AARON
0
Then sit we down and let us all consult.
DEMETRIUS
0
How many women saw this child of his?
AARON
0
Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
NURSE
0
Cornelia the midwife and myself;
AARON
0
The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
DEMETRIUS
0
What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
AARON
0
O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
CHIRON
0
Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
DEMETRIUS
0
For this care of Tamora,
AARON
0
Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
TITUS
0
Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
MARCUS
0
O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
PUBLIUS
0
Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns
MARCUS
0
Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
TITUS
0
Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
PUBLIUS
0
No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
TITUS
0
He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
MARCUS
0
Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
TITUS
0
Now, masters, draw.  [They shoot]  O, well said, Lucius!
MARCUS
0
My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
TITUS
0
Ha! ha!
MARCUS
0
This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
TITUS
0
Why, there it goes! God give his lordship joy!
CLOWN
0
Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
TITUS
0
But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
CLOWN
0
Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all
TITUS
0
Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
CLOWN
0
Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
TITUS
0
Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
CLOWN
0
From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
MARCUS
0
Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
TITUS
0
Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
CLOWN
0
Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
TITUS
0
Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
CLOWN
0
Ay, sir.
TITUS
0
Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to
CLOWN
0
I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
TITUS
0
Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.
CLOWN
0
God be with you, sir; I will.
TITUS
0
Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.     Exeunt
SATURNINUS
0
Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
TAMORA
0
My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
CLOWN
0
Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.
TAMORA
0
Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.
CLOWN
0
'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have
SATURNINUS
0
Go take him away, and hang him presently.
CLOWN
0
How much money must I have?
TAMORA
0
Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
CLOWN
0
Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
SATURNINUS
0
Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
AEMILIUS
0
Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
SATURNINUS
0
Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
TAMORA
0
Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
SATURNINUS
0
Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
TAMORA
0
King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
SATURNINUS
0
But he will not entreat his son for us.
TAMORA
0
If Tamora entreat him, then he will;
SATURNINUS
0
Aemilius, do this message honourably;
AEMILIUS
0
Your bidding shall I do effectually.            Exit
TAMORA
0
Now will I to that old Andronicus,
SATURNINUS
0
Then go successantly, and plead to him.
LUCIUS
0
Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
FIRST GOTH
0
Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
ALL THE GOTHS
0
And as he saith, so say we all with him.
LUCIUS
0
I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
SECOND GOTH
0
Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
LUCIUS
0
O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
AARON
0
Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
LUCIUS
0
Too like the sire for ever being good.
AARON
0
Lucius, save the child,
LUCIUS
0
Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
AARON
0
An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
LUCIUS
0
Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
AARON
0
Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
LUCIUS
0
Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
AARON
0
What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
LUCIUS
0
Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
AARON
0
First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
LUCIUS
0
O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
AARON
0
Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
LUCIUS
0
O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
AARON
0
Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
LUCIUS
0
O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
AARON
0
Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
GOTH
0
What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
AARON
0
Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
LUCIUS
0
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
AARON
0
Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
LUCIUS
0
Bring down the devil, for he must not die
AARON
0
If there be devils, would I were a devil,
LUCIUS
0
Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
GOTH
0
My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
LUCIUS
0
Let him come near.
AEMILIUS
0
Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths,
FIRST GOTH
0
What says our general?
LUCIUS
0
Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
TAMORA
0
Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
TITUS
0
Who doth molest my contemplation?
TAMORA
0
Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
TITUS
0
No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,
TAMORA
0
If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
TITUS
0
I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
TAMORA
0
Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
TITUS
0
Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
TAMORA
0
I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
TITUS
0
Do me some service ere I come to thee.
TAMORA
0
These are my ministers, and come with me.
TITUS
0
Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
TAMORA
0
Rape and Murder; therefore called so
TITUS
0
Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are!
TAMORA
0
This closing with him fits his lunacy.
TITUS
0
Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
TAMORA
0
What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
DEMETRIUS
0
Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
CHIRON
0
Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
TAMORA
0
Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
TITUS
0
Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
TAMORA
0
Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
TITUS
0
Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.
MARCUS
0
This will I do, and soon return again.            Exit
TAMORA
0
Now will I hence about thy business,
TITUS
0
Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
TAMORA
0
 [Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? Will you abide
TITUS
0
 [Aside]  I knew them all, though they suppos'd me mad,
DEMETRIUS
0
Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
TAMORA
0
Farewell, Andronicus, Revenge now goes
TITUS
0
I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
CHIRON
0
Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
TITUS
0
Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
PUBLIUS
0
What is your will?
TITUS
0
Know you these two?
PUBLIUS
0
The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.
TITUS
0
Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd.
CHIRON
0
Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons.
PUBLIUS
0
And therefore do we what we are commanded.
PUBLIUS
1
TITUS
And therefore do we what we are commanded.
    Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
    Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.
TITUS
1
TITUS
Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
LUCIUS
0
Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind
LUCIUS
0
Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
AARON
0
Some devil whisper curses in my ear,
LUCIUS
0
Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!
SATURNINUS
0
What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
LUCIUS
0
What boots it thee to can thyself a sun?
MARCUS
0
Rome's Emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
SATURNINUS
0
Marcus, we will.
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
Marcus, we will.
                      [A table brought in. The company sit down]
TITUS
1
TITUS
Welcome, my lord; welcome, dread Queen;
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
TITUS
1
TITUS
Because I would be sure to have all well
TAMORA
1
TITUS
We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
TITUS
1
TITUS
An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
It was, Andronicus.
TITUS
1
TITUS
Your reason, mighty lord.
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
Because the girl should not survive her shame,
TITUS
1
TITUS
A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
TITUS
1
TITUS
Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind.
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
TITUS
1
TITUS
Will't please you eat?  Will't please your Highness feed?
TAMORA
1
TITUS
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
TITUS
1
TITUS
Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
TITUS
1
TITUS
Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
SATURNINUS
1
TITUS
Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
LUCIUS
1
TITUS
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
MARCUS
1
TITUS
You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
LUCIUS
1
TITUS
Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
MARCUS
1
TITUS
Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.
AEMILIUS
1
TITUS
Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
ALL
1
TITUS
Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal Emperor!
MARCUS
1
TITUS
Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
ALL
1
TITUS
Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
LUCIUS
1
TITUS
Thanks, gentle Romans! May I govern so
MARCUS
1
TITUS
Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
LUCIUS
1
TITUS
Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us
MARCUS
1
TITUS
How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
BOY
1
TITUS
O grandsire, grandsire! ev'n with all my heart
BOY
2
TITUS
AARON
O grandsire, grandsire! ev'n with all my heart
    Would I were dead, so you did live again!
    O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
    My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
LUCIUS
2
TITUS
AARON
Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
AARON
2
TITUS
AARON
Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
LUCIUS
2
TITUS
AARON
Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
