    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.

    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.

OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.

    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.

PHILOSTRATE
THESEUS
LYSANDER
ESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

  PROLOGUE. 
4
PHILOSTRATE
THESEUS
LYSANDER
QUINCE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,

PUCK
TITANIA
ESEUS. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;
    Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
    Egeus, I will overbear your will;
    For in the temple, by and by, with us
    These couples shall eternally be knit.
    And, for the morning now is something worn,
    Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
    Away with us to Athens, three and three;
    We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
    Come, Hippolyta.

  FLUTE. 
1
QUINCE

1
QUINCE
INCE. It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able
  FLUTE. 
1
QUINCE
UTE. No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
  QUINCE. 
1
QUINCE
INCE. Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for
  FLUTE.

    during his life; he could not have scaped sixpence a day. An the
    Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll
    be hanged. He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus,

THESEUS

2
THESEUS
LYSANDER
PPOLYTA. But all the story of the night told over,
    And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
    More witnesseth than fancy's images,
    And grows to something of great constancy,
    But howsoever strange and admirable.

  THESEUS. 
3
PHILOSTRATE
THESEUS
LYSANDER
ESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

LYSANDER
QUINCE

LYSANDER
QUINCE

LYSANDER
QUINCE

  PROLOGUE.

THESEUS
LYSANDER
QUINCE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
  PROLOGUE. 
4
PHILOSTRATE
THESEUS
LYSANDER
QUINCE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,

LYSANDER

RAMUS. No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's

    You shall see it will fall pat as I told you; yonder she comes.

METRIUS. He should have worn the horns on his head.
  THESEUS.

    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

PHILOSTRATE
THESEUS
LYSANDER
QUINCE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.

ERON.    Now, until the break of day,
             Through this house each fairy stray.
             To the best bride-bed will we,
             Which by us shall blessed be;
             And the issue there create
             Ever shall be fortunate.
             So shall all the couples three
             Ever true in loving be;
             And the blots of Nature's hand
             Shall not in their issue stand;
             Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,
             Nor mark prodigious, such as are
             Despised in nativity,
             Shall upon their children be.
             With this field-dew consecrate,
             Every fairy take his gait,
             And each several chamber bless,
             Through this palace, with sweet peace;
             And the owner of it blest
             Ever shall in safety rest.
             Trip away; make no stay;
             Meet me all by break of day.    Exeunt all but PUCK

  HERMIA.

  THESEUS.

SANDER. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,

0
TTOM. Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I

INCE. Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may

  SNUG.

  QUINCE.

INCE. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any
  QUINCE.

INCE. An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the

INCE. Why, what you will.

TTOM. We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and

  FAIRY.

IRY. And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Then I must be thy lady; but I know
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. These are the forgeries of jealousy;
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Set your heart at rest;
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. How long within this wood intend you stay?
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Well, go thy way; thou shalt not from this grove
  PUCK.

CK. I remember.
  OBERON.

ERON. That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
  PUCK.

CK. I'll put a girdle round about the earth
  OBERON.

METRIUS. I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
  HELENA.

LENA. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. And even for that do I love you the more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. And I am sick when I look not on you.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. You do impeach your modesty too much
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Your virtue is my privilege for that:
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. I will not stay thy questions; let me go;

SANDER. Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood;
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
  HERMIA.

RMIA. Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Lysander riddles very prettily.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;
  HERMIA.

RMIA. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!

CK.      Through the forest have I gone,

LENA. Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
  DEMETRIUS.

  HELENA.

LENA. O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Stay on thy peril; I alone will go.            Exit
  HELENA.

LENA. O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. [Waking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Do not say so, Lysander; say not so.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Content with Hermia! No: I do repent
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there;

RMIA. [Starting] Help me, Lysander, help me; do thy best
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. Are we all met?
  QUINCE.

INCE. Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Peter Quince!
  QUINCE.

INCE. What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that
  SNOUT. 
0
OUT. By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
  STARVELING. 
0
ARVELING. I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Not a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a
  QUINCE.

INCE. Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
  SNOUT. 
0
OUT. Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
  STARVELING. 
0
ARVELING. I fear it, I promise you.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring in-
  SNOUT. 
0
OUT. Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things- that
  SNOUT. 
0
OUT. Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Yes, it doth shine that night.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
  SNOUT. 
0
OUT. You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some
  QUINCE.

INCE. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every

CK. What hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here,
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet-
  QUINCE.

INCE. 'Odious'- odorous!
  BOTTOM.

UTE. Must I speak now?
  QUINCE.

INCE. Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes but to
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
  QUINCE.

INCE. 'Ninus' tomb,' man! Why, you must not speak that yet; that
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. O- As true as truest horse, that y et would never tire.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
  QUINCE.

INCE. O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters! fly,
  PUCK. 
0
CK. I'll follow you; I'll lead you about a round,
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me
  SNOUT. 
0
OUT. O Bottom, thou art chang'd! What do I see on thee?
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. What do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art translated.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to
  TITANIA.

TANIA. What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed?
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. [Sings]
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this
  TITANIA.

ERON. I wonder if Titania be awak'd;
  PUCK.

CK. My mistress with a monster is in love.
  OBERON.

ERON. This falls out better than I could devise.
  PUCK. 
0
CK. I took him sleeping- that is finish'd too-
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
  PUCK.

CK. This is the woman, but not this the man.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. So should the murdered look; and so should I,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. What's this to my Lysander? Where is he?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. An if I could, what should I get therefore?
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. A privilege never to see me more.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. There is no following her in this fierce vein;
  OBERON.

ERON. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,
  PUCK.

CK. Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
  OBERON.

  PUCK.

CK.         Then will two at once woo one.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. You do advance your cunning more and more.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. [Awaking] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
  HELENA.

LENA. O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
  HELENA.

LENA. Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. Helen, it is not so.

RMIA. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. What love could press Lysander from my side?
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. I am amazed at your passionate words;
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. I understand not what you mean by this.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad looks,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. O excellent!
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Sweet, do not scorn her so.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I say I love thee more than he can do.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Quick, come.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Lysander, whereto tends all this?
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Away, you Ethiope!
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. No, no, he will
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Hang off, thou cat, thou burr; vile thing, let loose,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out!
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Do you not jest?
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Yes, sooth; and so do you.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I would I had your bond; for I perceive
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Ay, by my life!
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Fine, i' faith!
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. 'Puppet!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. 'Lower' hark, again.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. What! with Lysander?
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. With Demetrius.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd;
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. 'Little' again! Nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Get you gone, you dwarf;
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. You are too officious
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Now she holds me not.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Follow! Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. I will not trust you, I;

  OBERON. 
0
ERON. This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak'st,
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
  PUCK. 
0
CK. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. But we are spirits of another sort:
  PUCK. 
0
CK.      Up and down, up and down,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. I will be with thee straight.
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Follow me, then,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Lysander, speak again.
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Yea, art thou there?
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.       Exeunt
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. He goes before me, and still dares me on;
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Come hither; I am here.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. O weary night, O long and tedious night,
  PUCK. 
0
CK.       Yet but three? Come one more;
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Never so weary, never so in woe,
  PUCK. 
0
CK.          On the ground
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Come, sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed,
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Where's Peaseblossom?
  PEASEBLOSSOM. 
0
ASEBLOSSOM. Ready.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
  COBWEB. 
0
BWEB. Ready.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Mounsieur Cobweb; good mounsieur, get you your weapons in
  MUSTARDSEED. 
0
STARDSEED. Ready.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you, leave
  MUSTARDSEED. 
0
STARDSEED. What's your will?
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the tongs
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. [Advancing] Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. My Oberon! What visions have I seen!
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. There lies your love.
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. How came these things to pass?
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA. Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep!
  PUCK. 
0
CK. Now when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep.
  OBERON. 
0
ERON. Sound, music. Come, my Queen, take hands with me,
  PUCK. 
0
CK.       Fairy King, attend and mark;
  OBERON. 
0
ERON.     Then, my Queen, in silence sad,
  TITANIA. 
0
TANIA.    Come, my lord; and in our flight,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Go, one of you, find out the forester;
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
  EGEUS. 
0
EUS. My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. No doubt they rose up early to observe
  EGEUS. 
0
EUS. It is, my lord.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Pardon, my lord.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. I pray you all, stand up.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
  EGEUS. 
0
EUS. Enough, enough, my Lord; you have enough;
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. These things seem small and undistinguishable,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. So methinks;
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Are you sure
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Yea, and my father.
  HELENA. 
0
LENA. And Hippolyta.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. And he did bid us follow to the temple.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Why, then, we are awake; let's follow him;
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
  STARVELING. 
0
ARVELING. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. If he come not, then the play is marr'd; it goes not
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. You must say 'paragon.' A paramour is- God bless us!- A
  SNUG. 
0
UG. Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple; and there is two
  FLUTE. 
0
UTE. O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what;
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. 'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. More strange than true. I never may believe
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. But all the story of the night told over,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. More than to us
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
  PHILOSTRATE. 
0
ILOSTRATE. Here, mighty Theseus.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?
  PHILOSTRATE. 
0
ILOSTRATE. There is a brief how many sports are ripe;
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
  PHILOSTRATE. 
0
ILOSTRATE. A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. What are they that do play it?
  PHILOSTRATE. 
0
ILOSTRATE. Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. And we will hear it.
  PHILOSTRATE. 
0
ILOSTRATE. No, my noble lord,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. I will hear that play;
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. He says they can do nothing in this kind.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
  PHILOSTRATE. 
0
ILOSTRATE. SO please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Let him approach.              [Flourish of trumpets]
  PROLOGUE. 
0
OLOGUE. If we offend, it is with our good will.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. This fellow doth not stand upon points.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired,
  PROLOGUE. 
0
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. I wonder if the lion be to speak.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
  WALL. 
0
LL. In this same interlude it doth befall
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. O wall, full often hast thou beard my moans,
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. I see a voice; now will I to the chink,
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. My love! thou art my love, I think.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
  WALL. 
0
LL. Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,
  LION. 
0
ON. You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. This lion is a very fox for his valour.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. True; and a goose for his discretion.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for
  MOONSHINE. 
0
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. He should have worn the horns on his head.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
  MOONSHINE. 
0
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Proceed, Moon.
  MOON. 
0
ON. All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY. This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
  LION. 
0
ON. [Roaring] O-                           [THISBY runs off]
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Well roar'd, Lion.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Well run, Thisby.
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Well mous'd, Lion.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. And then came Pyramus.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. And so the lion vanish'd.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
  PYRAMUS. 
0
RAMUS. O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her
  HIPPOLYTA. 
0
PPOLYTA. Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. And thus she moans, videlicet:-
  THISBY. 
0
ISBY.      Asleep, my love?
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Ay, and Wall too.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. [Starting up] No, I assure you; the wall is down that

PPOLYTA. Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;

ESEUS. Go, Philostrate,
  EGEUS. 
0
EUS. Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?
  EGEUS. 
0
EUS. Full of vexation come I, with complaint
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. What say you, Hermia? Be advis'd, fair maid.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. So is Lysander.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. In himself he is;
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Either to die the death, or to abjure
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
  THESEUS. 
0
ESEUS. Take time to pause; and by the next new moon-
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. You have her father's love, Demetrius;
  EGEUS.

EUS. Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,

RMIA. Belike for want of rain, which I could well
  LYSANDER.

SANDER. Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Or else misgraffed in respect of years-
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. O spite! too old to be engag'd to young.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
  LYSANDER. 
0
SANDER. A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.
  HERMIA.

RMIA. My good Lysander!
  LYSANDER.

  BOTTOM.

TTOM. What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?
  QUINCE.

INCE. A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

UTE. What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?
  QUINCE.

TANIA. Then I must be thy lady; but I know

ERON. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,

ERON. Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.

METRIUS. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;

  STARVELING.

ARVELING. I fear it, I promise you.
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring in-

  HELENA.

PUCK
LENA. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

  HERMIA.

  LYSANDER.

PUCK
METRIUS. I say I love thee more than he can do.

  HERMIA.

    Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,

    That fallen am I in dark uneven way,

PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. This fellow doth not stand upon points.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired,
  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,
  THESEUS.

METRIUS. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
  WALL. 
1
PHILOSTRATE

  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
  THESEUS.

PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's
  THISBY. 
1
PHILOSTRATE

  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE

  THISBY. 
1
PHILOSTRATE

PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
  THESEUS.

  LION.

  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. This lion is a very fox for his valour.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. True; and a goose for his discretion.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for
  MOONSHINE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. He should have worn the horns on his head.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
  MOONSHINE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should

1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!

    Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
    Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame

             Come, tears, confound;

METRIUS. So should the murdered look; and so should I,
  HERMIA.

RMIA. What's this to my Lysander? Where is he?
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
  HERMIA. 
0
RMIA. Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:

RMIA. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. An if I could, what should I get therefore?
  HERMIA.

RMIA. A privilege never to see me more.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. There is no following her in this fierce vein;

ERON. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,

                Sink in apple of his eye.
                When his love he doth espy,
                Let her shine as gloriously
                As the Venus of the sky.
                When thou wak'st, if she be by,
                Beg of her for remedy.

  LYSANDER.

PUCK
SANDER. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. You do advance your cunning more and more.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
  DEMETRIUS.

PUCK
METRIUS. [Awaking] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
  HELENA.

SANDER. Helen, it is not so.
  DEMETRIUS.

RMIA. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. What love could press Lysander from my side?
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. I am amazed at your passionate words;
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. I understand not what you mean by this.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad looks,

PUCK
SANDER. Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;

PUCK
LENA. O excellent!
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. Sweet, do not scorn her so.
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. I say I love thee more than he can do.

  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
  HELENA.

PUCK
LENA. A foolish heart that I leave here behind.

    And, like a forester, the groves may tread
    Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,
    Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
    Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.

    That fallen am I in dark uneven way,

PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE

  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,

RAMUS. O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE

1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
  THESEUS.

PHILOSTRATE

PHILOSTRATE

  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. This lion is a very fox for his valour.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. True; and a goose for his discretion.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his

1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for
  MOONSHINE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. He should have worn the horns on his head.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
  MOONSHINE.

PHILOSTRATE
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;

PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should

1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. Proceed, Moon.
  MOON. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ON. All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is

PYRAMUS
PHILOSTRATE
THISBY
RAMUS. O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
    Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
    Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame
    That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.
             Come, tears, confound;
             Out, sword, and wound
           The pap of Pyramus;
             Ay, that left pap,
             Where heart doth hop.               [Stabs himself]
           Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
             Now am I dead,
             Now am I fled;
           My soul is in the sky.
             Tongue, lose thy light;
             Moon, take thy flight.             [Exit MOONSHINE]

PYRAMUS
PHILOSTRATE
THISBY
SANDER. Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.

PYRAMUS
PHILOSTRATE

ESEUS. With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet

THISBY
PPOLYTA. How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back

PYRAMUS
PHILOSTRATE

             Which by us shall blessed be;

             So shall all the couples three
             Ever true in loving be;

             Shall not in their issue stand;

             Nor mark prodigious, such as are
             Despised in nativity,

TTOM. No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

OUT. Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
  STARVELING. 
0
ARVELING. I fear it, I promise you.
  BOTTOM. 
0
TTOM. Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring in-

  BOTTOM.

TTOM. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen
  QUINCE.

INCE. Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things- that

INCE. Yes, it doth shine that night.
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber
  QUINCE. 
0
INCE. Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a

OUT. You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
  BOTTOM.

TTOM. Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some

RMIA. What's this to my Lysander? Where is he?
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
  HERMIA.

RMIA. Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds
  DEMETRIUS.

METRIUS. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:

RMIA. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
  DEMETRIUS. 
0
METRIUS. An if I could, what should I get therefore?
  HERMIA.

METRIUS. There is no following her in this fierce vein;

                When his love he doth espy,
                Let her shine as gloriously
                As the Venus of the sky.

  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. You do advance your cunning more and more.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. [Awaking] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK

PUCK
LENA. Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

SANDER. Helen, it is not so.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
  HERMIA.

PUCK
RMIA. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. What love could press Lysander from my side?
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. I am amazed at your passionate words;
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. I understand not what you mean by this.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad looks,
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
  HELENA.

PUCK
LENA. O excellent!
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. Sweet, do not scorn her so.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. I say I love thee more than he can do.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. Quick, come.
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. Lysander, whereto tends all this?

PUCK
SANDER. Away, you Ethiope!
  DEMETRIUS.

PUCK
RMIA. Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out!
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. Do you not jest?
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Yes, sooth; and so do you.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. I would I had your bond; for I perceive
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Ay, by my life!
  HERMIA.

RMIA. O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
  HELENA.

LENA. Fine, i' faith!
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. 'Puppet!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. 'Lower' hark, again.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. What! with Lysander?
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. With Demetrius.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
  HELENA. 
1
PUCK
LENA. O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd;
  HERMIA. 
1
PUCK
RMIA. 'Little' again! Nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Get you gone, you dwarf;
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PUCK
METRIUS. You are too officious
  LYSANDER. 
1
PUCK
SANDER. Now she holds me not.
  DEMETRIUS.

CK. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
  OBERON. 
1
PUCK
ERON. Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.

CK. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
  OBERON. 
1
PUCK
ERON. But we are spirits of another sort:
  OBERON. 
1
PUCK
ERON. But we are spirits of another sort:
    I with the Morning's love have oft made sport;
    And, like a forester, the groves may tread
    Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,
    Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
    Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
    But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay;
    We may effect this business yet ere day.         Exit OBERON

    When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
    The villain is much lighter heel'd than I.
    I followed fast, but faster he did fly,
    That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
    And here will rest me. [Lies down] Come, thou gentle day.
    For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
    I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.        [Sleeps]

  THESEUS.

PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
OLOGUE. If we offend, it is with our good will.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. This fellow doth not stand upon points.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired,
  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
  PROLOGUE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
OLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,
  THESEUS.

PHILOSTRATE

  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
  WALL.

PHILOSTRATE

  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's
  THISBY. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ISBY. O wall, full often hast thou beard my moans,
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. I see a voice; now will I to the chink,

1
PHILOSTRATE
ISBY. My love! thou art my love, I think.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
  THISBY.

PHILOSTRATE
ISBY. And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
  THISBY. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ISBY. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
  PYRAMUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
RAMUS. O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
  THISBY. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ISBY. I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
  PYRAMUS.

PHILOSTRATE

PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,
  LION. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ON. You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. This lion is a very fox for his valour.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. True; and a goose for his discretion.
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for
  MOONSHINE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. He should have worn the horns on his head.
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
  MOONSHINE. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ONSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should
  DEMETRIUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it
  HIPPOLYTA. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
PPOLYTA. I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
  THESEUS. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ESEUS. It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is
  LYSANDER. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
SANDER. Proceed, Moon.
  MOON. 
1
PHILOSTRATE
ON. All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is
  DEMETRIUS.

PHILOSTRATE
METRIUS. Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these

PHILOSTRATE

METRIUS. Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these

RAMUS. O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
    Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
    Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame
    That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.
             Come, tears, confound;
             Out, sword, and wound
           The pap of Pyramus;
             Ay, that left pap,
             Where heart doth hop.               [Stabs himself]
           Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
             Now am I dead,
             Now am I fled;
           My soul is in the sky.
             Tongue, lose thy light;

             Which by us shall blessed be;
             And the issue there create
             Ever shall be fortunate.
             So shall all the couples three
             Ever true in loving be;
             And the blots of Nature's hand
             Shall not in their issue stand;

             Nor mark prodigious, such as are
             Despised in nativity,
