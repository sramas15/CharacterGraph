Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
HIPPOLYTA

Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
THESEUS
0
Go, Philostrate,
EGEUS
0
Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!
THESEUS
0
Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?
EGEUS
0
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
THESEUS
0
What say you, Hermia? Be advis'd, fair maid.
HERMIA
0
So is Lysander.
THESEUS
0
In himself he is;
HERMIA
0
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
THESEUS
0
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
HERMIA
0
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
THESEUS
0
Either to die the death, or to abjure
HERMIA
0
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
THESEUS
0
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon-
DEMETRIUS
0
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield
LYSANDER
0
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
EGEUS
0
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
LYSANDER
0
I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
THESEUS
0
I must confess that I have heard so much,
EGEUS
0
With duty and desire we follow you.
LYSANDER
0
How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale?
HERMIA
0
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
LYSANDER
0
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
HERMIA
0
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
LYSANDER
0
Or else misgraffed in respect of years-
HERMIA
0
O spite! too old to be engag'd to young.
LYSANDER
0
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
HERMIA
0
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
LYSANDER
0
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
HERMIA
0
If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
LYSANDER
0
A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.
HERMIA
0
My good Lysander!
LYSANDER
0
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
HERMIA
0
God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
HELENA
0
Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.
HERMIA
0
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
HELENA
0
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
HERMIA
0
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
HELENA
0
O that my prayers could such affection move!
HERMIA
0
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
HELENA
0
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
HERMIA
0
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
HELENA
0
None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
HERMIA
0
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
LYSANDER
0
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
HERMIA
0
And in the wood where often you and I
LYSANDER
0
I will, my Hermia. [Exit HERMIA] Helena, adieu;

How happy some o'er other some can be!

You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?

A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.

That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may

What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;

Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
TITANIA

Then I must be thy lady; but I know
OBERON

How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,

These are the forgeries of jealousy;

Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.

Set your heart at rest;

How long within this wood intend you stay?
TITANIA

Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
OBERON

Give me that boy and I will go with thee.

Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.

Well, go thy way; thou shalt not from this grove

You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;

And even for that do I love you the more.

Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;

And I am sick when I look not on you.
DEMETRIUS

You do impeach your modesty too much

Your virtue is my privilege for that:

Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood;

One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;

Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,

O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!

Lysander riddles very prettily.

Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;

No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
SNOUT

Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
STARVELING

I fear it, I promise you.
BOTTOM

Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring in-
SNOUT

Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen

Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things- that

Yes, it doth shine that night.

Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,

So should the murdered look; and so should I,

What's this to my Lysander? Where is he?
DEMETRIUS

I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds

You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:

Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
HELENA

You do advance your cunning more and more.
LYSANDER
1
PUCK
I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
HELENA
1

Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
LYSANDER

Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,

Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,

Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?

What love could press Lysander from my side?
LYSANDER
1
PUCK
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
HERMIA

PUCK
You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
HELENA
1
PUCK
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
HERMIA
1
PUCK
I am amazed at your passionate words;
HELENA

Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,

I understand not what you mean by this.

Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad looks,

Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;

Sweet, do not scorn her so.
DEMETRIUS

If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
LYSANDER

Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;

I say I love thee more than he can do.
LYSANDER

If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
DEMETRIUS

No, no, he will

Hang off, thou cat, thou burr; vile thing, let loose,

Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,

Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out!
HERMIA

Do you not jest?
HELENA

PUCK
Yes, sooth; and so do you.
LYSANDER

Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
DEMETRIUS

I would I had your bond; for I perceive
LYSANDER

What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
HERMIA

What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
LYSANDER

Ay, by my life!

Fine, i' faith!

Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.

Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?

A foolish heart that I leave here behind.

What! with Lysander?

With Demetrius.
LYSANDER

Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd;

Get you gone, you dwarf;

You are too officious

Now she holds me not.

Follow! Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.

You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.

Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.

But we are spirits of another sort:
OBERON

But we are spirits of another sort:

    Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
    But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay;

THESEUS

PHILOSTRATE
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
    And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most to my capacity.

Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
PROLOGUE
1
PHILOSTRATE
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    At large discourse while here they do remain.
                               Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY,

No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's
