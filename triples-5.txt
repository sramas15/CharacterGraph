You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
But what's the matter?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
None but the King?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
And why so?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
You speak him far.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
I do extend him, sir, within himself;
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
What's his name and birth?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
I cannot delve him to the root; his father
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
I honour him
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
His only child.
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
How long is this ago?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Some twenty years.
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
That a king's children should be so convey'd,
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
I do well believe you.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
QUEEN
0
No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
POSTHUMUS
0
Please your Highness,
QUEEN
0
You know the peril.
IMOGEN

O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
POSTHUMUS

My queen! my mistress!
POSTHUMUS
1
QUEEN
My queen! my mistress!
    O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
    To be suspected of more tenderness
    Than doth become a man. I will remain
    The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth;
    My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
    Who to my father was a friend, to me
    Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
    And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
    Though ink be made of gall.
QUEEN

QUEEN
Be brief, I pray you.
POSTHUMUS

Should we be taking leave
IMOGEN
1

Nay, stay a little.

How, how? Another?
IMOGEN

O the gods!

Alack, the King!

Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight

The gods protect you,

There cannot be a pinch in death

O disloyal thing,
IMOGEN
1
QUEEN
I beseech you, sir,
CYMBELINE
1
QUEEN
Past grace? obedience?
IMOGEN
1
QUEEN
Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.
CYMBELINE
1
QUEEN
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
IMOGEN
1
QUEEN
O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle,
CYMBELINE
1
QUEEN
Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
IMOGEN
1
QUEEN
No; I rather added

O thou vile one!

Sir,
CYMBELINE

What, art thou mad?
IMOGEN

Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were

Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were
    A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus

Thou foolish thing!

Beseech your patience.- Peace,

Fie! you must give way.

My lord your son drew on my master.

Ha!

There might have been,

I am very glad on't.
IMOGEN
1

Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part

On his command. He would not suffer me

This hath been

I humbly thank your Highness.

About some half-hour hence,
FIRST LORD
0
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
CLOTEN
0
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
FIRST LORD
0
Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
CLOTEN
0
The villain would not stand me.
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
FIRST LORD
0
Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
CLOTEN
0
I would they had not come between us.
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a
CLOTEN

And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
FIRST LORD
0
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection
CLOTEN
0
Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt
SECOND LORD
0
[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
CLOTEN
0
You'll go with us?
FIRST LORD
0
I'll attend your lordship.
CLOTEN
0
Nay, come, let's go together.
SECOND LORD
0
Well, my lord.                             Exeunt
IMOGEN
0
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven,
PISANIO
0
It was: his queen, his queen!
IMOGEN
0
Then wav'd his handkerchief?
PISANIO
0
And kiss'd it, madam.
IMOGEN
0
Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
PISANIO
0
No, madam; for so long
IMOGEN
0
Thou shouldst have made him
PISANIO
0
Madam, so I did.
IMOGEN
0
I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack'd them but
PISANIO
0
Be assur'd, madam,
IMOGEN
0
I did not take my leave of him, but had
LADY
0
The Queen, madam,
IMOGEN
0
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
PISANIO
0
Madam, I shall.                                Exeunt
IACHIMO
0
Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then
PHILARIO
0
You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
FRENCHMAN
0
I have seen him in France; we had very many there could
IACHIMO
0
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he

0
And then his banishment.
IACHIMO
0
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
PHILARIO
0
His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have
FRENCHMAN
0
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
POSTHUMUS
0
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
FRENCHMAN
0
Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did
POSTHUMUS
0
By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller;
FRENCHMAN
0
Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and
IACHIMO
0
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
FRENCHMAN
0
Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which
IACHIMO
0
That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion,
POSTHUMUS
0
She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
IACHIMO
0
You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.
POSTHUMUS
0
Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate
IACHIMO
0
As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison-
POSTHUMUS
0
I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone.
IACHIMO
0
What do you esteem it at?
POSTHUMUS
0
More than the world enjoys.
IACHIMO
0
Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's
POSTHUMUS
0
You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there
IACHIMO
0
Which the gods have given you?
POSTHUMUS
0
Which by their graces I will keep.
IACHIMO
0
You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl
POSTHUMUS
0
Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
PHILARIO
0
Let us leave here, gentlemen.
POSTHUMUS
0
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank
IACHIMO
0
With five times so much conversation I should get ground
POSTHUMUS
0
No, no.
IACHIMO
0
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
POSTHUMUS
0
You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion,
IACHIMO
0
What's that?
POSTHUMUS
0
A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve
PHILARIO
0
Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let
IACHIMO
0
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th'
POSTHUMUS
0
What lady would you choose to assail?
IACHIMO
0
Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will
POSTHUMUS
0
I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I
IACHIMO
0
You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy
POSTHUMUS
0
This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver
IACHIMO
0
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's
POSTHUMUS
0
Will you? I Shall but lend my diamond till your return.
PHILARIO
0
I will have it no lay.
IACHIMO
0
By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient
POSTHUMUS
0
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt
IACHIMO
0
Your hand- a covenant! We will have these things set down
POSTHUMUS
0
Agreed.                Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO

Will this hold, think you?
PHILARIO

Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow 'em.

[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has

    Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
    When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
    I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
    As great as is thy master; greater, for
    His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
    Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
    Continue where he is. To shift his being
    Is to exchange one misery with another,
    And every day that comes comes comes to
    A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
    To be depender on a thing that leans,
    Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
    So much as but to prop him?
                  [The QUEEN drops the box. PISANIO takes it up]
    Thou tak'st up
    Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.
    It is a thing I made, which hath the King
    Five times redeem'd from death. I do not know
    What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;
    It is an earnest of a further good
    That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
    The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
    Think what a chance thou changest on; but think
    Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
    Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King
    To any shape of thy preferment, such
    As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
    That set thee on to this desert, am bound
    To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
    Think on my words.                              Exit PISANIO
    A sly and constant knave,
    Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,
    And the remembrancer of her to hold
    The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
    Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
    Of leigers for her sweet; and which she after,
    Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd
    To taste of too.

I never saw him sad.

Will my lord say so?

No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to

Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

Why, so I say.

Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court

A stranger, and I not known on't?

Not easily, I think.

Sir- I thank her- that.

May be she pluck'd it of

She writes so to you, doth she?
POSTHUMUS

O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
PHILARIO

Have patience, sir,
POSTHUMUS
0
Very true;
IACHIMO

By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!
POSTHUMUS
0
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
PHILARIO
0
Sir, be patient;
POSTHUMUS
0
Never talk on't;
IACHIMO
0
If you seek
POSTHUMUS
0
Ay, and it doth confirm
IACHIMO
0
Will you hear more?
POSTHUMUS
0
Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns.
IACHIMO
0
I'll be sworn-
POSTHUMUS
0
No swearing.
IACHIMO
0
I'll deny nothing.
POSTHUMUS
0
O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!
PHILARIO

Quite besides
IACHIMO

With all my heart.                             Exeunt

I am sorry, Cymbeline,

Thou art welcome, Caius.
LUCIUS

Let proof speak.

His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or

So, sir.

I know your master's pleasure, and he mine;

How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
IMOGEN
0
How now, Pisanio!
PISANIO

Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
IMOGEN

Who? thy lord? That is my lord- Leonatus?
PISANIO

One score 'twixt sun and sun,
IMOGEN

Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
PISANIO
0
Madam, you're best consider.
IMOGEN

I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,

A goodly day not to keep house with such

Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS

Hail, heaven!
BELARIUS
0
Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,
GUIDERIUS
0
Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg'd,
ARVIRAGUS
0
What should we speak of
BELARIUS
0
How you speak!
GUIDERIUS
0
Uncertain favour!
BELARIUS
0
My fault being nothing- as I have told you oft-
IMOGEN

Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place

Alas, good lady!

I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,

Good madam, hear me.
IMOGEN

True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,

Why, I must die;
PISANIO

O gracious lady,
IMOGEN

Do't, and to bed then.
PISANIO

I'll wake mine eyeballs first.
IMOGEN
0
Wherefore then

But to win time
IMOGEN

Talk thy tongue weary- speak.
PISANIO

Then, madam,
IMOGEN

Most like-
PISANIO

Not so, neither;
IMOGEN

Some Roman courtezan!
PISANIO
0
No, on my life!
IMOGEN

Why, good fellow,
PISANIO

If you'll back to th' court-
IMOGEN

No court, no father, nor no more ado
PISANIO

If not at court,
IMOGEN

Where then?
PISANIO

I am most glad
IMOGEN
0
O! for such means,
PISANIO
0
Well then, here's the point:
IMOGEN
0
Nay, be brief;
PISANIO
0
First, make yourself but like one.
IMOGEN
0
Thou art all the comfort
PISANIO
0
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
IMOGEN
0
Amen. I thank thee.                   Exeunt severally

Thus far; and so farewell.

Royal sir,
    Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd
    Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
    'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
    Forbear sharp speeches to her; she's a lady
    So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,
    And strokes death to her.

Where is she, sir? How

Go, look after.                             Exit CLOTEN
    Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
    He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
    Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes
    It is a thing most precious. But for her,
    Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz'd her;
    Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown
    To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is
    To death or to dishonour, and my end
    Can make good use of either. She being down,
    I have the placing of the British crown.
CLOTEN

'Tis certain she is fled.

PISANIO
CLOTEN
MESSENGER
Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing;
    I'll remember't anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I
    kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a
    time- the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart- that she
    held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble
    and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities.
    With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him,
    and in her eyes. There shall she see my valour, which will then
    be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of
    insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined-
    which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that
    she so prais'd- to the court I'll knock her back, foot her home
    again. She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my
    revenge.

O thou goddess,
    Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st

    As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
    Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
    Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind
    That by the top doth take the mountain pine
    And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder
    That an invisible instinct should frame them
    To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
    Civility not seen from other, valour
    That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
    As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
    What Cloten's being here to us portends,
    Or what his death will bring us.

Sir, my life is yours;

The time is troublesome.

So please your Majesty,

Now for the counsel of my son and queen!

Good my liege,

I thank you. Let's withdraw,

I heard no letter from my master since
GUIDERIUS

The noise is round about us.
BELARIUS

Let us from it.

What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it

Nay, what hope

It is not likely

BELARIUS
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
    Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,
    The Princess of this country, and the air on't
    Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
    A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
    In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne
    As I wear mine are titles but of scorn.
    If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
    This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
    Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.            Exit
    The battle continues; the BRITONS fly; CYMBELINE is taken.

No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,

Where was this lane?

Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf,

This was strange chance:

GAOLER
[Waking] Sleep, thou has been a grandsire and begot
    A father to me; and thou hast created
    A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
    Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born.
    And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend
    On greatness' favour, dream as I have done;
    Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve;
    Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
    And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,
    That have this golden chance, and know not why.
    What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
    Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
    Nobler than that it covers. Let thy effects
    So follow to be most unlike our courtiers,
    As good as promise.
    [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
    without seeking find, and be embrac'd by a piece of tender air;
    and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches which,
    being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
    stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
    Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'
    'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
    Tongue, and brain not; either both or nothing,
    Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such
    As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
    The action of my life is like it, which
    I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

GAOLER
Come, sir, are you ready for death?
POSTHUMUS

Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

Hail, great King!

Who worse than a physician

With horror, madly dying, like her life;
CYMBELINE
0
Prithee say.
CORNELIUS
0
First, she confess'd she never lov'd you; only
CYMBELINE
0
She alone knew this;
CORNELIUS
0
Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
CYMBELINE
0
O most delicate fiend!
CORNELIUS
0
More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had

Heard you all this, her women?

We did, so please your Highness.

Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day

I have surely seen him;

I humbly thank your Highness.

I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
IMOGEN
0
No, no! Alack,
LUCIUS

The boy disdains me,
CYMBELINE
0
What wouldst thou, boy?
IMOGEN
0
He is a Roman, no more kin to me
CYMBELINE

Wherefore ey'st him so?
IMOGEN

I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
CYMBELINE
0
Ay, with all my heart,

Fidele, sir.

Thou'rt my good youth, my page;

Is not this boy reviv'd from death?

One sand another

The same dead thing alive.
BELARIUS

Peace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear.
GUIDERIUS

But we saw him dead.

Be silent; let's see further.

[Aside] It is my mistress.

Come, stand thou by our side;

My boon is that this gentleman may render

That diamond upon your finger, say

Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that

How? me?

I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that

All that belongs to this.

That paragon, thy daughter,

My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;

Upon a time- unhappy was the clock
CYMBELINE

I stand on fire.

All too soon I shall,

Nay, nay, to th' purpose.

Peace, my lord. Hear, hear!

Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,

O gentlemen, help!
CYMBELINE

Does the world go round?
POSTHUMUS

How comes these staggers on me?
PISANIO

Wake, my mistress!
CYMBELINE

If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me

How fares my mistress?

O, get thee from my sight;

O gods!

What's this, Cornelius?

The Queen, sir, very oft importun'd me

Most like I did, for I was dead.

This is sure Fidele.

My lord,

Let me end the story:

0
Marry, the gods forfend!
GUIDERIUS
0
I have spoke it, and I did it.
CYMBELINE
0
He was a prince.
GUIDERIUS
0
A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
CYMBELINE
0
I am sorry for thee.

That headless man

0
Bind the offender,
BELARIUS
0
Stay, sir King.
CYMBELINE
0
Why, old soldier,
ARVIRAGUS
0
In that he spake too far.
CYMBELINE
0
And thou shalt die for't.
BELARIUS
0
We will die all three;
ARVIRAGUS
0
Your danger's ours.
GUIDERIUS
0
And our good his.
BELARIUS
0
Have at it then by leave!

What of him? He is

He it is that hath

Take him hence,

Not too hot.

Nursing of my sons?

I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee.
CYMBELINE
0
How? my issue?

0
So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,

Thou weep'st and speak'st.

Be pleas'd awhile.

Did you e'er meet?

Ay, my good lord.

And at first meeting lov'd,
