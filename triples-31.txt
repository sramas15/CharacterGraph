TROILUS

PANDARUS
Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again.
    Why should I war without the walls of Troy
    That find such cruel battle here within?
    Each Troyan that is master of his heart,
    Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none!

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Will this gear ne'er be mended?

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,
    Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
    But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
    Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
    Less valiant than the virgin in the night,
    And skilless as unpractis'd infancy.

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part,
    I'll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake
    out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Have I not tarried?

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Have I not tarried?

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Still have I tarried.

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
    'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating
    of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too,
    or you may chance to burn your lips.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
    Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do.
    At Priam's royal table do I sit;
    And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts-
    So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her
    look, or any woman else.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
I was about to tell thee: when my heart,
    As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
    I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.
    But sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
    Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well,
    go to- there were no more comparison between the women. But, for
    my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
    I did. I  will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit; but-

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus-
    When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,
    Reply not in how many fathoms deep
    They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
    In Cressid's love. Thou answer'st 'She is fair'-
    Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-
    Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
    Handlest in thy discourse. O, that her hand,
    In whose comparison all whites are ink
    Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure
    The cygnet's down is harsh, and spirit of sense
    Hard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell'st me,
    As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
    But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
    Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    The knife that made it.

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
I speak no more than truth.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Thou dost not speak so much.

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is: if
    she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the
    mends in her own hands.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
    her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but
    small thanks for my labour.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as
    Helen. An she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a Friday
    as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she were a
    blackamoor; 'tis all one to me.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Say I she is not fair?

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay
    behind her father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her
    the next time I see her. For my part, I'll meddle nor make no
    more i' th' matter.

TROILUS
1
PANDARUS
Pandarus!

PANDARUS
1
TROILUS
Not I.

TROILUS

PANDARUS
Sweet Pandarus!

PANDARUS

TROILUS
Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all

TROILUS

Peace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!
    Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
    When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
    I cannot fight upon this argument;
    It is too starv'd a subject for my sword.
    But Pandarus-O gods, how do you plague me!
    I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
    And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
    As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
    Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
    What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
    Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;
    Between our Ilium and where she resides
    Let it be call'd the wild and wand'ring flood;
    Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
    Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.
                Alarum. Enter AENEAS

TROILUS
How now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?

TROILUS
0
Because not there. This woman's answer sorts,
    For womanish it is to be from thence.
    What news, Aeneas, from the field to-day?

AENEAS
0
TROILUS
That Paris is returned home, and hurt.

TROILUS
0
By whom, Aeneas?

AENEAS

TROILUS
Troilus, by Menelaus.

Let Paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
    Paris is gor'd with Menelaus' horn.                      [Alarum]

Hark what good sport is out of town to-day!

Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'

CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Come, go we then together.                          Exeunt

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Who were those went by?

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
Queen Hecuba and Helen.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
And whither go they?

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
Up to the eastern tower,
    Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
    To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
    Is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was mov'd.
    He chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;
    And, like as there were husbandry in war,
    Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    And to the field goes he; where every flower
    Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
    In Hector's wrath.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
What was his cause of anger?

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
    A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
    They call him Ajax.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Good; and what of him?

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
They say he is a very man per se,
    And stands alone.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
    legs.

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
This man, lady, hath robb'd many beasts of their
    particular additions: he is as valiant as a lion, churlish as the
    bear, slow as the elephant-a man into whom nature hath so crowded
    humours that his valour is crush'd into folly, his folly sauced
    with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a
    glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of
    it; he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair; he
    hath the joints of every thing; but everything so out of joint
    that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind
    Argus, all eyes and no sight.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector
      angry?

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
They say he yesterday cop'd Hector in the battle and
    struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
    kept Hector fasting and waking.
                          Enter PANDARUS

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Who comes here?

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
Madam, your uncle Pandarus.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Hector's a gallant man.

ALEXANDER
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
As may be in the world, lady.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
What's that? What's that?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?- Good
    morrow, Alexander.-How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
This morning, uncle.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm'd
    and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
E'en so. Hector was stirring early.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
That were we talking of, and of his anger.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Was he angry?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
So he says here.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about
    him today, I can tell them that. And there's Troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell
    them that too.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
What, is he angry too?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man
    if you see him?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
So he is.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Condition I had gone barefoot to India.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
He is not Hector.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Himself! no, he's not himself. Would 'a were himself!
    Well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus,
    well! I would my heart were in her body! No, Hector is not a
    better man than Troilus.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Excuse me.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
He is elder.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Pardon me, pardon me.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
    when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not have his wit this
    year.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
He shall not need it if he have his own.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Nor his qualities.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
No matter.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Nor his beauty.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
'Twould not become him: his own's better.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
YOU have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th'
    other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, I must
    confess- not brown neither-

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
No, but brown.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
To say the truth, true and not true.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
She prais'd his complexion above Paris.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Why, Paris hath colour enough.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
So he has.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Then Troilus should have too much. If she prais'd him
    above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
    enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
    complexion. I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended
    Troilus for a copper nose.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day
    into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or
    four hairs on his chin-

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
    lift as much as his brother Hector.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Why, you know, 'tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes
    him better than any man in all Phrygia.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
O, he smiles valiantly!

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Does he not?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Why, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves
    Troilus-

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an
    addle egg.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
    chin. Indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, I must needs
    confess.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Without the rack.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh'd that
    her eyes ran o'er.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
With millstones.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
And Cassandra laugh'd.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. Did her eyes run o'er too?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
And Hector laugh'd.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
At what was all this laughing?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus'
    chin.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
An't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd too.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
What was his answer?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Quoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
    and one of them is white.'

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
This is her question.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and fifty
    hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. That white hair is my father,
    and all the rest are his sons.' 'Jupiter!' quoth she 'which of
    these hairs is Paris my husband?' 'The forked one,' quoth he,
    'pluck't out and give it him.' But there was such laughing! and
    Helen so blush'd, and Paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so
    laugh'd that it pass'd.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
So I do.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
    man born in April.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
    against May.                                    [Sound a retreat]

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Hark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up
    here and see them as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do,
    sweet niece Cressida.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
At your pleasure.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
    most bravely. I'll tell you them all by their names as they pass
    by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
                       AENEAS passes

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Speak not so loud.

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
That's Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He's one of the
    flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus; you shall see
    anon.
                       ANTENOR passes

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Who's that?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
That's Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and
    he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
    Troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. When comes Troilus?
    I'll show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see him nod
    at me.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Will he give you the nod?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
You shall see.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
If he do, the rich shall have more.
                     HECTOR passes

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
    fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man, niece. O brave
    Hector! Look how he looks. There's a countenance! Is't not a
    brave man?

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
O, a brave man!

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Is 'a not? It does a man's heart good. Look you what
    hacks are on his helmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you
    there. There's no jesting; there's laying on; take't off who
    will, as they say. There be hacks.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Be those with swords?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
    it's all one. By God's lid, it does one's heart good. Yonder
    comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
                       PARIS passes
    Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? Why,
    this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home to-day? He's not
    hurt. Why, this will do Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could
    see Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
                      HELENUS passes

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Who's that?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
    Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Can Helenus fight, uncle?

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Helenus! no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I marvel
    where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the people cry 'Troilus'?
    Helenus is a priest.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
                    TROILUS passes

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Where? yonder? That's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus. There's a
    man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Peace, for shame, peace!

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him,
    niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more
    hack'd than Hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! O
    admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. Go thy way,
    Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a
    goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris
    is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change, would give an
    eye to boot.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
Here comes more.
                 Common soldiers pass

PANDARUS
2
TROILUS
CRESSIDA
ALEXANDER
Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
    porridge after meat! I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus.
    Ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone. Crows and daws,
    crows and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than
    Agamemnon and all Greece.

CRESSIDA
2
TROILUS
ALEXANDER
There is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than
    Troilus.

Princes,
    What grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?
    The ample proposition that hope makes
    In all designs begun on earth below
    Fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters
    Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
    Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
    Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
    That we come short of our suppose so far
    That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
    Sith every action that hath gone before,
    Whereof we have record, trial did draw
    Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
    And that unbodied figure of the thought
    That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
    Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
    And call them shames, which are, indeed, nought else
    But the protractive trials of great Jove
    To find persistive constancy in men;
    The fineness of which metal is not found
    In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward,
    The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
    The hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin.
    But in the wind and tempest of her frown
    Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
    Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
    And what hath mass or matter by itself
    Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.

With due observance of thy godlike seat,
    Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
    Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
    Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,
    How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
    Upon her patient breast, making their way
    With those of nobler bulk!
    But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
    The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
    The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
    Bounding between the two moist elements
    Like Perseus' horse. Where's then the saucy boat,
    Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
    Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled
    Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
    Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
    In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
    The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
    Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
    Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
    And flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage
    As rous'd with rage, with rage doth sympathise,
    And with an accent tun'd in self-same key
    Retorts to chiding fortune.

Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
    And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    But for these instances:
    The specialty of rule hath been neglected;
    And look how many Grecian tents do stand
    Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
    When that the general is not like the hive,
    To whom the foragers shall all repair,
    What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
    Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
    The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,
    Observe degree, priority, and place,
    Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
    Office, and custom, in all line of order;
    And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
    In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd
    Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye
    Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
    And posts, like the commandment of a king,
    Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets
    In evil mixture to disorder wander,
    What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,
    What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,
    Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,
    Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,
    The unity and married calm of states
    Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak'd,
    Which is the ladder of all high designs,
    The enterprise is sick! How could communities,
    Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,
    Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
    The primogenity and due of birth,
    Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
    But by degree, stand in authentic place?
    Take but degree away, untune that string,
    And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts
    In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
    Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,
    And make a sop of all this solid globe;
    Strength should be lord of imbecility,
    And the rude son should strike his father dead;
    Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong-
    Between whose endless jar justice resides-
    Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
    Then everything includes itself in power,
    Power into will, will into appetite;
    And appetite, an universal wolf,
    So doubly seconded with will and power,
    Must make perforce an universal prey,
    And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
    This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
    Follows the choking.
    And this neglection of degree it is
    That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
    It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
    By him one step below, he by the next,
    That next by him beneath; so ever step,
    Exampl'd by the first pace that is sick
    Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
    Of pale and bloodless emulation.
    And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
    Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
    Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.

The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
    The sinew and the forehand of our host,
    Having his ear full of his airy fame,
    Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
    Lies mocking our designs; with him Patroclus
    Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
    Breaks scurril jests;
    And with ridiculous and awkward action-
    Which, slanderer, he imitation calls-
    He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
    Thy topless deputation he puts on;
    And like a strutting player whose conceit
    Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
    To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
    'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
    Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
    He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks
    'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
    Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd,
    Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
    The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
    From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
    Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
    As he being drest to some oration.'
    That's done-as near as the extremest ends
    Of parallels, as like Vulcan and his wife;
    Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
    'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
    Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
    And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
    Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit
    And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
    Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport
    Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
    Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
    In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion
    All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
    Severals and generals of grace exact,
    Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
    Excitements to the field or speech for truce,
    Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
    As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.

    Ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    In such a rein, in full as proud a place
    As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,

    We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
    A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
    Who in this dull and long-continued truce
    Is resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet
    And to this purpose speak: Kings, princes, lords!
    If there be one among the fair'st of Greece

    That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
    That knows his valour and knows not his fear,
    That loves his mistress more than in confession
    With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
    And dare avow her beauty and her worth
    In other arms than hers-to him this challenge.
    Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,
    Shall make it good or do his best to do it:
    He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,
    Than ever Greek did couple in his arms;
    And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
    Mid-way between your tents and walls of Troy
    To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.
    If any come, Hector shall honour him;
    If none, he'll say in Troy, when he retires,
    The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    The splinter of a lance. Even so much.

Why, 'tis most meet. Who may you else oppose

    For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute

    Our imputation shall be oddly pois'd

    Although particular, shall give a scantling
    Of good or bad unto the general;
    And in such indexes, although small pricks
    To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
    The baby figure of the giant mas
    Of things to come at large. It is suppos'd
    He that meets Hector issues from our choice;
    And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
    Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
    As 'twere from forth us all, a man distill'd
    Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
    What heart receives from hence a conquering part,

    In taint of our best man. No, make a lott'ry;
    And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
    The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves
    Give him allowance for the better man;
    For that will physic the great Myrmidon,
    Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
    His crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.
    If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
    We'll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
    Yet go we under our opinion still
    That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
    Our project's life this shape of sense assumes-
    Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.

I take to-day a wife, and my election

    Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,

    The wife I chose? There can be no evasion
    To blench from this and to stand firm by honour.
    We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
    When we have soil'd them; nor the remainder viands
    We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
    Because we now are full. It was thought meet
    Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks;
    Your breath with full consent benied his sails;
    The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,
    And did him service. He touch'd the ports desir'd;
    And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
    He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
    Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
    Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.
    Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl
    Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
    And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
    If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went-
    As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go'-
    If you'll confess he brought home worthy prize-
    As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands,
    And cried 'Inestimable!' -why do you now

    And do a deed that never fortune did-
    Beggar the estimation which you priz'd
    Richer than sea and land? O theft most base,

    Wip'd off in honourable keeping her.
    What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
    Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
    Now to deliver her possession up
    On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
    That so degenerate a strain as this
    Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
    There's not the meanest spirit on our party
    Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
    When Helen is defended; nor none so noble
    Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
    Where Helen is the subject. Then, I say,
    Well may we fight for her whom we know well
    The world's large spaces cannot parallel.

Paris and Troilus, you have both said well;
    And on the cause and question now in hand
    Have gloz'd, but superficially; not much
    Unlike young men, whom Aristode thought
    Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
    The reasons you allege do more conduce
    To the hot passion of distemp'red blood
    Than to make up a free determination
    'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
    Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
    Of any true decision. Nature craves
    All dues be rend'red to their owners. Now,
    What nearer debt in all humanity
    Than wife is to the husband? If this law
    Of nature be corrupted through affection;
    And that great minds, of partial indulgence
    To their benumbed wills, resist the same;
    There is a law in each well-order'd nation
    To curb those raging appetites that are
    Most disobedient and refractory.
    If Helen, then, be wife to Sparta's king-
    As it is known she is-these moral laws
    Of nature and of nations speak aloud
    To have her back return'd. Thus to persist
    In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
    But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
    Is this, in way of truth. Yet, ne'er the less,
    My spritely brethren, I propend to you
    In resolution to keep Helen still;
    For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
    Upon our joint and several dignities.

Why, there you touch'd the life of our design.
    Were it not glory that we more affected
    Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
    I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood
    Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
    She is a theme of honour and renown,
    A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
    Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
    And fame in time to come canonize us;

    Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
    Disguise the holy strength of their command,

What, am I poor of late?
    'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
    Must fall out with men too. What the declin'd is,
    He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
    As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
    Show not their mealy wings but to the summer;
    And not a man for being simply man
    Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
    That are without him, as place, riches, and favour,
    Prizes of accident, as oft as merit;
    Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
    The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
    Doth one pluck down another, and together
    Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
    Fortune and I are friends; I do enjoy
    At ample point all that I did possess
    Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
    Something not worth in me such rich beholding
    As they have often given. Here is Ulysses.

This is not strange, Ulysses.
    The beauty that is borne here in the face
    The bearer knows not, but commends itself

    That most pure spirit of sense-behold itself,
    Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
    Salutes each other with each other's form;
    For speculation turns not to itself

    Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

I do not strain at the position-
    It is familiar-but at the author's drift;
    Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
    That no man is the lord of anything,
    Though in and of him there be much consisting,
    Till he communicate his parts to others;
    Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
    Till he behold them formed in th' applause
    Where th' are extended; who, like an arch, reverb'rate
    The voice again; or, like a gate of steel
    Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
    His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;
    And apprehended here immediately
    Th' unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!
    A very horse that has he knows not what!
    Nature, what things there are
    Most abject in regard and dear in use!
    What things again most dear in the esteem
    And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow-
    An act that very chance doth throw upon him-
    Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
    While some men leave to do!
    How some men creep in skittish Fortune's-hall,
    Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
    How one man eats into another's pride,
    While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
    To see these Grecian lords!-why, even already
    They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
    As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast,
    And great Troy shrinking.

Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
    Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
    A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
    Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd
    As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
    As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,
    Keeps honour bright. To have done is to hang
    Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
    In monumental mock'ry. Take the instant way;
    For honour travels in a strait so narrow -
    Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,
    For emulation hath a thousand sons
    That one by one pursue; if you give way,
    Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
    Like to an ent'red tide they all rush by
    And leave you hindmost;
    Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
    Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
    O'er-run and trampled on. Then what they do in present,
    Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
    For Time is like a fashionable host,
    That slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand;
    And with his arms out-stretch'd, as he would fly,
    Grasps in the corner. The welcome ever smiles,
    And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek
    Remuneration for the thing it was;
    For beauty, wit,
    High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
    Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
    To envious and calumniating Time.
    One touch of nature makes the whole world kin-
    That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
    Though they are made and moulded of things past,
    And give to dust that is a little gilt
    More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
    The present eye praises the present object.
    Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
    That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,
    Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
    Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,
    And still it might, and yet it may again,
    If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
    And case thy reputation in thy tent,
    Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
    Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves,
    And drave great Mars to faction.

Both alike:
    He merits well to have her that doth seek her,

    And you as well to keep her that defend her,
    Not palating the taste of her dishonour,

    A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple

    A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,

The youngest son of Priam, a true knight;
    Not yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word;
    Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
    Not soon provok'd, nor being provok'd soon calm'd;
    His heart and hand both open and both free;
    For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,
    Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
    Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;
    Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
    For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
    To tender objects, but he in heat of action
    Is more vindicative than jealous love.
    They call him Troilus, and on him erect
    A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
    Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth
    Even to his inches, and, with private soul,
    Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.

Why, then will I no more.
    Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,

    A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
    Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so
    That thou could'st say 'This hand is Grecian all,
    And this is Troyan; the sinews of this leg
    All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
    Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
    Bounds in my father's'; by Jove multipotent,
    Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
    Wherein my sword had not impressure made
    Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay
    That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
    My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
    Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax.
    By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
    Hector would have them fall upon him thus.

My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite

    Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
    A token from her daughter, my fair love,
    Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
    An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.
    Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
    My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
    Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent;
    This night in banqueting must all be spent.

With too much blood and too little brain these two may

    I'll be a curer of madmen. Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow
    enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain
    as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his
    brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of
    cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his
    brother's leg-to what form but that he is, should wit larded with
    malice, and malice forced with wit, turn him to? To an ass, were
    nothing: he is both ass and ox. To an ox, were nothing: he is both
    ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a
    lizard, an owl, a put-tock, or a herring without a roe, I would
    not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny.
    Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care
    not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus. Hey-day!

    The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolv'd, and loos'd;
    And with another knot, five-finger-tied,

I am a bastard too; I love bastards. I am a bastard

    wherefore should one bastard? Take heed, the quarrel's most
    ominous to us: if the son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts

You understand me not that tell me so.
    I do not speak of flight, of fear of death,
    But dare all imminence that gods and men
    Address their dangers in. Hector is gone.
    Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
    Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd
    Go in to Troy, and say there 'Hector's dead.'
    There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
    Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
    Cold statues of the youth; and, in a word,
    Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away;
    Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
    Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
    Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
    Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
    I'll through and through you. And, thou great-siz'd coward,
    No space of earth shall sunder our two hates;
    I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
    That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
    Strike a free march to Troy. With comfort go;
    Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
