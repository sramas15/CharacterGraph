TROILUS
0
Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again.
PANDARUS
0
Will this gear ne'er be mended?
TROILUS
0
The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,
PANDARUS
0
Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part,
TROILUS
0
Have I not tarried?
PANDARUS
0
Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
TROILUS
0
Have I not tarried?
PANDARUS
0
Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
TROILUS
0
Still have I tarried.
PANDARUS
0
Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
TROILUS
0
Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
PANDARUS
0
Well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her
TROILUS
0
I was about to tell thee: when my heart,
PANDARUS
0
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well,
TROILUS
0
O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus-
PANDARUS
0
I speak no more than truth.
TROILUS
0
Thou dost not speak so much.
PANDARUS
0
Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is: if
TROILUS
0
Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!
PANDARUS
0
I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
TROILUS
0
What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?
PANDARUS
0
Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as
TROILUS
0
Say I she is not fair?
PANDARUS
0
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay
TROILUS
0
Pandarus!
PANDARUS
0
Not I.
TROILUS
0
Sweet Pandarus!
PANDARUS
0
Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all
TROILUS
0
Peace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!
AENEAS
0
How now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?
TROILUS
0
Because not there. This woman's answer sorts,
AENEAS
0
That Paris is returned home, and hurt.
TROILUS
0
By whom, Aeneas?
AENEAS
0
Troilus, by Menelaus.
TROILUS
0
Let Paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
AENEAS
0
Hark what good sport is out of town to-day!
TROILUS
0
Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
AENEAS
0
In all swift haste.
TROILUS
0
Come, go we then together.                          Exeunt
CRESSIDA
0
Who were those went by?
ALEXANDER
0
Queen Hecuba and Helen.
CRESSIDA
0
And whither go they?
ALEXANDER
0
Up to the eastern tower,
CRESSIDA
0
What was his cause of anger?
ALEXANDER
0
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
CRESSIDA
0
Good; and what of him?
ALEXANDER
0
They say he is a very man per se,
CRESSIDA
0
So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
ALEXANDER
0
This man, lady, hath robb'd many beasts of their
CRESSIDA
0
But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector
ALEXANDER
0
They say he yesterday cop'd Hector in the battle and
CRESSIDA
0
Who comes here?
ALEXANDER
0
Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
CRESSIDA
0
Hector's a gallant man.
ALEXANDER
0
As may be in the world, lady.
PANDARUS
0
What's that? What's that?
CRESSIDA
0
Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
PANDARUS
0
Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?- Good
CRESSIDA
0
This morning, uncle.
PANDARUS
0
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm'd
CRESSIDA
0
Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.
PANDARUS
0
E'en so. Hector was stirring early.
CRESSIDA
0
That were we talking of, and of his anger.
PANDARUS
0
Was he angry?
CRESSIDA
0
So he says here.
PANDARUS
0
True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about
CRESSIDA
0
What, is he angry too?
PANDARUS
0
Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
CRESSIDA
0
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
PANDARUS
0
What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man
CRESSIDA
0
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
PANDARUS
0
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
CRESSIDA
0
Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.
PANDARUS
0
No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
CRESSIDA
0
'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.
PANDARUS
0
Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!
CRESSIDA
0
So he is.
PANDARUS
0
Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
CRESSIDA
0
He is not Hector.
PANDARUS
0
Himself! no, he's not himself. Would 'a were himself!
CRESSIDA
0
Excuse me.
PANDARUS
0
He is elder.
CRESSIDA
0
Pardon me, pardon me.
PANDARUS
0
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
CRESSIDA
0
He shall not need it if he have his own.
PANDARUS
0
Nor his qualities.
CRESSIDA
0
No matter.
PANDARUS
0
Nor his beauty.
CRESSIDA
0
'Twould not become him: his own's better.
PANDARUS
0
YOU have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th'
CRESSIDA
0
No, but brown.
PANDARUS
0
Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
CRESSIDA
0
To say the truth, true and not true.
PANDARUS
0
She prais'd his complexion above Paris.
CRESSIDA
0
Why, Paris hath colour enough.
PANDARUS
0
So he has.
CRESSIDA
0
Then Troilus should have too much. If she prais'd him
PANDARUS
0
I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
CRESSIDA
0
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
PANDARUS
0
Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day
CRESSIDA
0
Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
PANDARUS
0
Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
CRESSIDA
0
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
PANDARUS
0
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
CRESSIDA
0
Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
PANDARUS
0
Why, you know, 'tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes
CRESSIDA
0
O, he smiles valiantly!
PANDARUS
0
Does he not?
CRESSIDA
0
O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
PANDARUS
0
Why, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves
CRESSIDA
0
Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
PANDARUS
0
Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an
CRESSIDA
0
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
PANDARUS
0
I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
CRESSIDA
0
Without the rack.
PANDARUS
0
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
CRESSIDA
0
Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.
PANDARUS
0
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh'd that
CRESSIDA
0
With millstones.
PANDARUS
0
And Cassandra laugh'd.
CRESSIDA
0
But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
PANDARUS
0
And Hector laugh'd.
CRESSIDA
0
At what was all this laughing?
PANDARUS
0
Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus'
CRESSIDA
0
An't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd too.
PANDARUS
0
They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
CRESSIDA
0
What was his answer?
PANDARUS
0
Quoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
CRESSIDA
0
This is her question.
PANDARUS
0
That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and fifty
CRESSIDA
0
So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
PANDARUS
0
Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
CRESSIDA
0
So I do.
PANDARUS
0
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
CRESSIDA
0
And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
PANDARUS
0
Hark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up
CRESSIDA
0
At your pleasure.
PANDARUS
0
Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
CRESSIDA
0
Speak not so loud.
PANDARUS
0
That's Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He's one of the
CRESSIDA
0
Who's that?
PANDARUS
0
That's Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and
CRESSIDA
0
Will he give you the nod?
PANDARUS
0
You shall see.
CRESSIDA
0
If he do, the rich shall have more.
PANDARUS
0
That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
CRESSIDA
0
O, a brave man!
PANDARUS
0
Is 'a not? It does a man's heart good. Look you what
CRESSIDA
0
Be those with swords?
PANDARUS
0
Swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
CRESSIDA
0
Who's that?
PANDARUS
0
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
CRESSIDA
0
Can Helenus fight, uncle?
PANDARUS
0
Helenus! no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I marvel
CRESSIDA
0
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
PANDARUS
0
Where? yonder? That's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus. There's a
CRESSIDA
0
Peace, for shame, peace!
PANDARUS
0
Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him,
CRESSIDA
0
Here comes more.
PANDARUS
0
Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
CRESSIDA
0
There is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than
PANDARUS
0
Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!
CRESSIDA
0
Well, well.
PANDARUS
0
Well, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any
CRESSIDA
0
Ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in
PANDARUS
0
You are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you
CRESSIDA

Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend
PANDARUS
0
Say one of your watches.
CRESSIDA
0
Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
PANDARUS
0
You are such another!
BOY
0
Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
PANDARUS
0
Where?
BOY
0
At your own house; there he unarms him.
PANDARUS
0
Good boy, tell him I come.                       Exit Boy
CRESSIDA
0
Adieu, uncle.
PANDARUS
0
I will be with you, niece, by and by.
CRESSIDA
0
To bring, uncle.
PANDARUS
0
Ay, a token from Troilus.
CRESSIDA
0
By the same token, you are a bawd.
AGAMEMNON

Princes,

With due observance of thy godlike seat,
ULYSSES

Agamemnon,
AGAMEMNON
0
Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
ULYSSES
0
Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
NESTOR
0
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
AGAMEMNON
0
The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
ULYSSES
0
The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
NESTOR
0
And in the imitation of these twain-
ULYSSES
0
They tax our policy and call it cowardice,
NESTOR
0
Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
AGAMEMNON
0
What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.
MENELAUS
0
From Troy.
AGAMEMNON
0
What would you fore our tent?
AENEAS
0
Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
AGAMEMNON
0
Even this.
AENEAS
0
May one that is a herald and a prince
AGAMEMNON
0
With surety stronger than Achilles' an
AENEAS
0
Fair leave and large security. How may
AGAMEMNON
0
How?
AENEAS
0
Ay;
AGAMEMNON
0
This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy
AENEAS
0
Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
AGAMEMNON
0
Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
AENEAS
0
Ay, Greek, that is my name.
AGAMEMNON
0
What's your affair, I pray you?
AENEAS
0
Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
AGAMEMNON
0
He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.
AENEAS
0
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him;
AGAMEMNON
0
Speak frankly as the wind;
AENEAS
0
Trumpet, blow loud,
AGAMEMNON
0
This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.
NESTOR
0
Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
AENEAS
0
Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!
ULYSSES
0
Amen.
AGAMEMNON
0
Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;
ULYSSES
0
Nestor!
NESTOR
0
What says Ulysses?
ULYSSES
0
I have a young conception in my brain;
NESTOR
0
What is't?
ULYSSES
0
This 'tis:
NESTOR
0
Well, and how?
ULYSSES
0
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
NESTOR
0
True. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance
ULYSSES
0
And wake him to the answer, think you?
NESTOR
0
Why, 'tis most meet. Who may you else oppose
ULYSSES
0
Give pardon to my speech.
NESTOR
0
I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?
ULYSSES
0
What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
NESTOR
0
Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice;

The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted

Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?

The proclamation!

Thou art proclaim'd, a fool, I think.

Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.
THERSITES

I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the

Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles; and

Thou shouldst strike him.

Why, how now, Ajax! Wherefore do you thus?
THERSITES

You see him there, do you?
ACHILLES
0
Ay; what's the matter?
THERSITES
0
Nay, look upon him.
ACHILLES
0
So I do. What's the matter?
THERSITES
0
Nay, but regard him well.
ACHILLES
0
Well! why, so I do.
THERSITES
0
But yet you look not well upon him; for who some ever

I know that, fool.
THERSITES

Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
AJAX

Therefore I beat thee.
THERSITES

Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His

What?
THERSITES

I say this Ajax-             [AJAX offers to strike him]
ACHILLES
0
Nay, good Ajax.
THERSITES

Has not so much wit-

0
Nay, I must hold you.
THERSITES

As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he

I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not-

O thou damned cur! I shall-

Will you set your wit to a fool's?

No, I warrant you, the fool's will shame it.

Good words, Thersites.

What's the quarrel?

I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the

I serve thee not.

Well, go to, go to.
THERSITES

Your last service was suff'rance; 'twas not voluntary. No

E'en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your

There's Ulysses and old Nestor-whose wit was mouldy ere

Yes, good sooth. To Achilles, to Ajax, to-

ULYSSES
PATROCLUS
Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
    fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass,
    his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself
    but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.

I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.

What's his excuse?

He doth rely on none;

Why will he not, upon our fair request,

Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,

If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the

Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.

A paltry, insolent fellow!

Can he not be sociable?

Our noble general, do not do so.

You must prepare to fight without Achilles.

If he were proud.

I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
    Th' imaginary relish is so sweet
    That it enchants my sense; what will it be
    When that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed
    Love's thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;
    Swooning destruction; or some joy too fine,
    Too subtle-potent, tun'd too sharp in sweetness,
    For the capacity of my ruder powers.
    I fear it much; and I do fear besides
    That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
    As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
    The enemy flying.

I'll give you boot; I'll give you three for one.

You are an odd man; give even or give none.
