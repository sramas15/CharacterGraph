Ber
0
Who's there.?
Fran
0
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Ber
0
Long live the King!
Fran
0
Bernardo?
Ber
0
He.
Fran
0
You come most carefully upon your hour.
Ber
0
'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Fran
0
For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
Ber
0
Have you had quiet guard?
Fran
0
Not a mouse stirring.
Ber
0
Well, good night.
Fran
0
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Hor
0
Friends to this ground.
Mar
0
And liegemen to the Dane.
Fran
0
Give you good night.
Mar
0
O, farewell, honest soldier.
Fran
0
Bernardo hath my place.
Mar
0
Holla, Bernardo!
Ber
0
Say-
Hor
0
A piece of him.
Ber
0
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
Mar
0
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Ber
0
I have seen nothing.
Mar
0
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Hor
0
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Ber
0
Sit down awhile,
Hor
0
Well, sit we down,
Ber
0
Last night of all,
Mar
0
Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Ber
0
In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Mar
0
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Ber
0
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
Hor
0
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Ber
0
It would be spoke to.
Mar
0
Question it, Horatio.
Hor
0
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Mar
0
It is offended.
Ber
0
See, it stalks away!
Hor
0
Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Mar
0
'Tis gone and will not answer.
Ber
0
How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Hor
0
Before my God, I might not this believe
Mar
0
Is it not like the King?
Hor
0
As thou art to thyself.
Mar
0
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Hor
0
In what particular thought to work I know not;
Mar
0
Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Hor
0
That can I.
Ber
0
I think it be no other but e'en so.
Hor
0
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Mar
0
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Hor
0
Do, if it will not stand.
Ber
0
'Tis here!
Hor
0
'Tis here!
Mar
0
'Tis gone!
Ber
0
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Hor
0
And then it started, like a guilty thing
Mar
0
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Hor
0
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
King
0
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Cor
0
 Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
King
0
We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
Laer
0
My dread lord,
King
0
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Pol
0
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
King
0
Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
Ham
0
[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
King
0
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Ham
0
Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
Queen
0
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Ham
0
Ay, madam, it is common.
Queen
0
If it be,
Ham
0
Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
King
0
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Queen
0
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Ham
0
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
King
0
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Ham
0
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Hor
0
Hail to your lordship!
Ham
0
I am glad to see you well.
Hor
0
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Ham
0
Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
Mar
0
My good lord!
Ham
0
I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-
Hor
0
A truant disposition, good my lord.
Ham
0
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Hor
0
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Ham
0
I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
Hor
0
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Ham
0
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Hor
0
O, where, my lord?
Ham
0
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
Hor
0
I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
Ham
0
He was a man, take him for all in all.
Hor
0
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Ham
0
Saw? who?
Hor
0
My lord, the King your father.
Ham
0
The King my father?
Hor
0
Season your admiration for a while
Ham
0
For God's love let me hear!
Hor
0
Two nights together had these gentlemen
Ham
0
But where was this?
Mar
0
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Ham
0
Did you not speak to it?
Hor
0
My lord, I did;
Ham
0
'Tis very strange.
Hor
0
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Ham
0
Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Ham
0
Arm'd, say you?
Both
0
Arm'd, my lord.
Ham
0
From top to toe?
Both
0
My lord, from head to foot.
Ham
0
Then saw you not his face?
Hor
0
O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
Ham
0
What, look'd he frowningly.
Hor
0
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Ham
0
Pale or red?
Hor
0
Nay, very pale.
Ham
0
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Hor
0
Most constantly.
Ham
0
I would I had been there.
Hor
0
It would have much amaz'd you.
Ham
0
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Hor
0
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Both
0
Longer, longer.
Hor
0
Not when I saw't.
Ham
0
His beard was grizzled- no?
Hor
0
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
Ham
0
I will watch to-night.
Hor
0
I warr'nt it will.
Ham
0
If it assume my noble father's person,
All
0
Our duty to your honour.
Ham
0
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
Laer
0
My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
Oph
0
Do you doubt that?
Laer
0
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
Oph
0
No more but so?
Laer
0
Think it no more.
Oph
0
I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
Laer
0
O, fear me not!
Pol
0
Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
Laer
0
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Pol
0
The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
Laer
0
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
Oph
0
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
Laer
0
Farewell.                                          Exit.
Pol
0
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
Oph
0
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Pol
0
Marry, well bethought!
Oph
0
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Pol
0
Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
Oph
0
I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
Pol
0
Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
Oph
0
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
Pol
0
Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
Oph
0
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Pol
0
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
Oph
0
I shall obey, my lord.
Ham
0
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
Hor
0
It is a nipping and an eager air.
Ham
0
What hour now?
Hor
0
I think it lacks of twelve.
Mar
0
No, it is struck.
Hor
0
Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Ham
0
The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Hor
0
Is it a custom?
Ham
0
Ay, marry, is't;
Hor
0
Look, my lord, it comes!
Ham
0
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Hor
0
It beckons you to go away with it,
Mar
0
Look with what courteous action
Hor
0
No, by no means!
Ham
0
It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
Hor
0
Do not, my lord!
Ham
0
Why, what should be the fear?
Hor
0
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Ham
0
It waves me still.
Mar
0
You shall not go, my lord.
Ham
0
Hold off your hands!
Hor
0
Be rul'd. You shall not go.
Ham
0
My fate cries out
Hor
0
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Mar
0
Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
Hor
0
Have after. To what issue wail this come?
Mar
0
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Hor
0
Heaven will direct it.
Mar
0
Nay, let's follow him.
Ham
0
Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
Ghost
0
Mark me.
Ham
0
I will.
Ghost
0
My hour is almost come,
Ham
0
Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost
0
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
Ham
0
Speak. I am bound to hear.
Ghost
0
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
Ham
0
What?
Ghost
0
I am thy father's spirit,
Ham
0
O God!
Ghost
0
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
Ham
0
Murther?
Ghost
0
Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
Ham
0
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Ghost
0
I find thee apt;
Ham
0
O my prophetic soul!
Ghost
0
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Ham
0
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
Ghost
0
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Ham
0
O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
Hor
0
(within) My lord, my lord!
Mar
0
Lord Hamlet!
Hor
0
Heaven secure him!
Ham
0
So be it!
Mar
0
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Ham
0
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
Mar
0
How is't, my noble lord?
Hor
0
What news, my lord?
Mar
0
O, wonderful!
Hor
0
Good my lord, tell it.
Ham
0
No, you will reveal it.
Hor
0
Not I, my lord, by heaven!
Mar
0
Nor I, my lord.
Ham
0
How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
Both
0
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ham
0
There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
Hor
0
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
Ham
0
Why, right! You are in the right!
Hor
0
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Ham
0
I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
Hor
0
There's no offence, my lord.
Ham
0
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Hor
0
What is't, my lord? We will.
Ham
0
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Both
0
My lord, we will not.
Ham
0
Nay, but swear't.
Hor
0
In faith,
Mar
0
Nor I, my lord- in faith.
Ham
0
Upon my sword.
Mar
0
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Ham
0
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost
0
Swear.
Ham
0
Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
Hor
0
Propose the oath, my lord.
Ham
0
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Ghost
0
[beneath] Swear.
Ham
0
Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Ghost
0
[beneath] Swear by his sword.
Ham
0
Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
Hor
0
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
Ham
0
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
Ghost
0
[beneath] Swear.
Ham
0
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
Pol
0
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
Rey
0
I will, my lord.
Pol
0
You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
Rey
0
My lord, I did intend it.
Pol
0
Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
Rey
0
Ay, very well, my lord.
Pol
0
'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
Rey
0
As gaming, my lord.
Pol
0
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Rey
0
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Pol
0
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
Rey
0
But, my good lord-
Pol
0
Wherefore should you do this?
Rey
0
Ay, my lord,
Pol
0
Marry, sir, here's my drift,
Rey
0
Very good, my lord.
Pol
0
And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
Rey
0
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
Pol
0
At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
Rey
0
My lord, I have.
Pol
0
God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
Rey
0
Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
Pol
0
Observe his inclination in yourself.
Rey
0
I shall, my lord.
Pol
0
And let him ply his music.
Rey
0
Well, my lord.
Pol
0
Farewell!
Oph
0
O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
Pol
0
With what, i' th' name of God I
Oph
0
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Pol
0
Mad for thy love?
Oph
0
My lord, I do not know,
Pol
0
What said he?
Oph
0
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Pol
0
Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
Oph
0
No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
Pol
0
That hath made him mad.
King
0
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Queen
0
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
Ros
0
Both your Majesties
Guil
0
But we both obey,
King
0
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Queen
0
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
Guil
0
Heavens make our presence and our practices
Queen
0
Ay, amen!
Pol
0
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
King
0
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Pol
0
Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
King
0
O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
Pol
0
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
King
0
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Queen
0
I doubt it is no other but the main,
King
0
Well, we shall sift him.
Volt
0
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
King
0
It likes us well;
Pol
0
This business is well ended.
Queen
0
More matter, with less art.
Pol
0
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Queen
0
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Pol
0
Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]
King
0
But how hath she
Pol
0
What do you think of me?
King
0
As of a man faithful and honourable.
Pol
0
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
King
0
Do you think 'tis this?
Queen
0
it may be, very like.
Pol
0
Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
King
0
Not that I know.
Pol
0
[points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
King
0
How may we try it further?
Pol
0
You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Queen
0
So he does indeed.
Pol
0
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
King
0
We will try it.
Queen
0
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Pol
0
Away, I do beseech you, both away
Ham
0
Well, God-a-mercy.
Pol
0
Do you know me, my lord?
Ham
0
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
Pol
0
Not I, my lord.
Ham
0
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Pol
0
Honest, my lord?
Ham
0
Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
Pol
0
That's very true, my lord.
Ham
0
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
Pol
0
I have, my lord.
Ham
0
Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
Pol
0
[aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
Ham
0
Words, words, words.
Pol
0
What is the matter, my lord?
Ham
0
Between who?
Pol
0
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Ham
0
Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
Pol
0
[aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
Ham
0
Into my grave?
Pol
0
Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
Ham
0
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
Pol
0
Fare you well, my lord.
Ham
0
These tedious old fools!
Pol
0
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
Ros
0
[to Polonius] God save you, sir!
Guil
0
My honour'd lord!
Ros
0
My most dear lord!
Ham
0
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
Ros
0
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Guil
0
Happy in that we are not over-happy.
Ham
0
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Ros
0
Neither, my lord.
Ham
0
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
Guil
0
Faith, her privates we.
Ham
0
In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
Ros
0
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Ham
0
Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
Guil
0
Prison, my lord?
Ham
0
Denmark's a prison.
Ros
0
Then is the world one.
Ham
0
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
Ros
0
We think not so, my lord.
Ham
0
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
Ros
0
Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
Ham
0
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
Guil
0
Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
Ham
0
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Ros
0
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
Ham
0
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
Both
0
We'll wait upon you.
Ham
0
No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
Ros
0
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Ham
0
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
Guil
0
What should we say, my lord?
Ham
0
Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
Ros
0
To what end, my lord?
Ham
0
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
Ros
0
[aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
Ham
0
[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
Guil
0
My lord, we were sent for.
Ham
0
I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
Ros
0
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Ham
0
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
Ros
0
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
Ham
0
He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
Ros
0
Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
Ham
0
How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
Ros
0
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
Ham
0
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
Ros
0
No indeed are they not.
Ham
0
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
Ros
0
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
Ham
0
What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
Ros
0
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
Ham
0
Is't possible?
Guil
0
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Ham
0
Do the boys carry it away?
Ros
0
Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
Ham
0
It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
Guil
0
There are the players.
Ham
0
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
Guil
0
In what, my dear lord?
Ham
0
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
Pol
0
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Ham
0
Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
Ros
0
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
Ham
0
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
Pol
0
My lord, I have news to tell you.
Ham
0
My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
Pol
0
The actors are come hither, my lord.
Ham
0
Buzz, buzz!
Pol
0
Upon my honour-
Ham
0
Then came each actor on his ass-
Pol
0
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
Ham
0
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Pol
0
What treasure had he, my lord?
Ham
0
Why,
Pol
0
[aside] Still on my daughter.
Ham
0
Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
Pol
0
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
Ham
0
Nay, that follows not.
Pol
0
What follows then, my lord?
Ham
0
Why,
Ham
0
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
Pol
0
Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
Pol
0
This is too long.
Ham
0
It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
Ham
0
'The mobled queen'?
Pol
0
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
Pol
0
Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
Ham
0
'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
Pol
0
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
Ham
0
God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
Pol
0
Come, sirs.
Ham
0
Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
Ham
0
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
Ham
0
Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
Ros
0
Good my lord!
Ham
0
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
King
0
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Ros
0
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
Guil
0
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Queen
0
Did he receive you well?
Ros
0
Most like a gentleman.
Guil
0
But with much forcing of his disposition.
Ros
0
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Queen
0
Did you assay him
Ros
0
Madam, it so fell out that certain players
Pol
0
'Tis most true;
King
0
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
Ros
0
We shall, my lord.
King
0
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
Queen
0
I shall obey you;
Oph
0
Madam, I wish it may.
Pol
0
Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
King
0
[aside] O, 'tis too true!
Pol
0
I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
Ham
0
To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Oph
0
Good my lord,
Ham
0
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
Oph
0
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
Ham
0
No, not I!
Oph
0
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
Ham
0
Ha, ha! Are you honest?
Oph
0
My lord?
Ham
0
Are you fair?
Oph
0
What means your lordship?
Ham
0
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
Oph
0
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Ham
0
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
Oph
0
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Ham
0
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
Oph
0
I was the more deceived.
Ham
0
Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
Oph
0
At home, my lord.
Ham
0
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
Oph
0
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Ham
0
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
Oph
0
O heavenly powers, restore him!
Ham
0
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
Oph
0
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
King
0
Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Pol
0
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
King
0
It shall be so.
Ham
0
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
Player
0
I warrant your honour.
Ham
0
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
Player
0
I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
Ham
0
O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
Pol
0
And the Queen too, and that presently.
Ham
0
Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
Both
0
We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
Ham
0
What, ho, Horatio!
Hor
0
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Ham
0
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
Hor
0
O, my dear lord!
Ham
0
Nay, do not think I flatter;
Hor
0
Well, my lord.
Ham
0
They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
King
0
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Ham
0
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
King
0
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
Ham
0
No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
Pol
0
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
Ham
0
What did you enact?
Pol
0
I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
Ham
0
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
Ros
0
Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
Queen
0
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
Ham
0
No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
Pol
0
[to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
Ham
0
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
Oph
0
No, my lord.
Ham
0
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Oph
0
Ay, my lord.
Ham
0
Do you think I meant country matters?
Oph
0
I think nothing, my lord.
Ham
0
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
Oph
0
What is, my lord?
Ham
0
Nothing.
Oph
0
You are merry, my lord.
Ham
0
Who, I?
Oph
0
Ay, my lord.
Ham
0
O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
Oph
0
Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Ham
0
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
Oph
0
What means this, my lord?
Ham
0
Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
Oph
0
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Ham
0
We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
Oph
0
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ham
0
Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
Oph
0
You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
Ham
0
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Oph
0
'Tis brief, my lord.
Ham
0
As woman's love.
Ham
0
[aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
Ham
0
If she should break it now!
Ham
0
Madam, how like you this play?
Queen
0
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
Ham
0
O, but she'll keep her word.
King
0
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
Ham
0
No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
King
0
What do you call the play?
Ham
0
'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
Oph
0
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
Ham
0
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
Oph
0
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
Ham
0
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Oph
0
Still better, and worse.
Ham
0
So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
Ham
0
He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.
Oph
0
The King rises.
Ham
0
What, frighted with false fire?
Queen
0
How fares my lord?
Pol
0
Give o'er the play.
King
0
Give me some light! Away!
All
0
Lights, lights, lights!
Ham
0
  Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
Hor
0
Half a share.
Ham
0
  A whole one I!
Hor
0
You might have rhym'd.
Ham
0
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
Hor
0
Very well, my lord.
Ham
0
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
Hor
0
I did very well note him.
Ham
0
  Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
Guil
0
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Ham
0
Sir, a whole history.
Guil
0
The King, sir-
Ham
0
Ay, sir, what of him?
Guil
0
Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
Ham
0
With drink, sir?
Guil
0
No, my lord; rather with choler.
Ham
0
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
Guil
0
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
Ham
0
I am tame, sir; pronounce.
Guil
0
The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
Ham
0
You are welcome.
Guil
0
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
Ham
0
Sir, I cannot.
Guil
0
What, my lord?
Ham
0
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
Ros
0
Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
Ham
0
O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
Ros
0
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
Ham
0
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
Ros
0
My lord, you once did love me.
Ham
0
And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
Ros
0
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
Ham
0
Sir, I lack advancement.
Ros
0
How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
Ham
0
Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
Guil
0
O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
Ham
0
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
Guil
0
My lord, I cannot.
Ham
0
I pray you.
Guil
0
Believe me, I cannot.
Ham
0
I do beseech you.
Guil
0
I know, no touch of it, my lord.
Ham
0
It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
Guil
0
But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
Ham
0
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
Pol
0
My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
Ham
0
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Pol
0
By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
Ham
0
Methinks it is like a weasel.
Pol
0
It is back'd like a weasel.
Ham
0
Or like a whale.
Pol
0
Very like a whale.
Ham
0
Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
Pol
0
I will say so.                                      Exit.
Ham
0
'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
King
0
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
Guil
0
We will ourselves provide.
Ros
0
The single and peculiar life is bound
King
0
Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
Both
0
We will haste us.
Pol
0
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
King
0
Thanks, dear my lord.
Ham
0
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
King
0
[rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Pol
0
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
Ham
0
(within) Mother, mother, mother!
Queen
0
I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
Ham
0
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Queen
0
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Ham
0
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Queen
0
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Ham
0
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Queen
0
Why, how now, Hamlet?
Ham
0
What's the matter now?
Queen
0
Have you forgot me?
Ham
0
No, by the rood, not so!
Queen
0
Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
Ham
0
Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
Queen
0
What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
Pol
0
[behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
Ham
0
[draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
Pol
0
[behind] O, I am slain!
Queen
0
O me, what hast thou done?
Ham
0
Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
Queen
0
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Ham
0
A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
Queen
0
As kill a king?
Ham
0
Ay, lady, it was my word.
Queen
0
What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
Ham
0
Such an act
Queen
0
Ay me, what act,
Ham
0
Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
Queen
0
O Hamlet, speak no more!
Ham
0
Nay, but to live
Queen
0
O, speak to me no more!
Ham
0
A murtherer and a villain!
Queen
0
No more!
Ham
0
A king of shreds and patches!-
Queen
0
Alas, he's mad!
Ham
0
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Ghost
0
Do not forget. This visitation
Ham
0
How is it with you, lady?
Queen
0
Alas, how is't with you,
Ham
0
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
Queen
0
To whom do you speak this?
Ham
0
Do you see nothing there?
Queen
0
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Ham
0
Nor did you nothing hear?
Queen
0
No, nothing but ourselves.
Ham
0
Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
Queen
0
This is the very coinage of your brain.
Ham
0
Ecstasy?
Queen
0
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
Ham
0
O, throw away the worser part of it,
Queen
0
What shall I do?
Ham
0
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Queen
0
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
Ham
0
I must to England; you know that?
Queen
0
Alack,
Ham
0
There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
King
0
There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
Queen
0
Bestow this place on us a little while.
King
0
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
Queen
0
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
King
0
O heavy deed!
Queen
0
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
King
0
O Gertrude, come away!
Ham
0
Safely stow'd.
Gentlemen
0
(within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
Ham
0
But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
Ros
0
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Ham
0
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Ros
0
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
Ham
0
Do not believe it.
Ros
0
Believe what?
Ham
0
That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
Ros
0
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ham
0
Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
Ros
0
I understand you not, my lord.
Ham
0
I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
Ros
0
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
Ham
0
The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
Guil
0
A thing, my lord?
Ham
0
Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
King
0
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
Ros
0
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
King
0
But where is he?
Ros
0
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
King
0
Bring him before us.
Ros
0
Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
King
0
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Ham
0
At supper.
King
0
At supper? Where?
Ham
0
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
King
0
Alas, alas!
Ham
0
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
King
0
What dost thou mean by this?
Ham
0
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
King
0
Where is Polonius?
Ham
0
In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
King
0
Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
Ham
0
He will stay till you come.
King
0
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
Ham
0
For England?
King
0
Ay, Hamlet.
Ham
0
Good.
King
0
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
Ham
0
I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
King
0
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Ham
0
My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
King
0
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
For
0
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Capt
0
I will do't, my lord.
For
0
Go softly on.
Ham
0
Good sir, whose powers are these?
Capt
0
They are of Norway, sir.
Ham
0
How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
Capt
0
Against some part of Poland.
Ham
0
Who commands them, sir?
Capt
0
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Ham
0
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Capt
0
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
Ham
0
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Capt
0
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Ham
0
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Capt
0
God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
Ros
0
Will't please you go, my lord?
Ham
0
I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
Queen
0
I will not speak with her.
Gent
0
She is importunate, indeed distract.
Queen
0
What would she have?
Gent
0
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
Hor
0
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Queen
0
Let her come in.
Oph
0
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
Queen
0
How now, Ophelia?
Oph

Queen
0
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Oph
0
Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
Queen
0
Nay, but Ophelia-
Oph
0
Pray you mark.
Queen
0
Alas, look here, my lord!
Oph

King
0
How do you, pretty lady?
Oph
0
Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
King
0
Conceit upon her father.
Oph
0
Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
King
0
Pretty Ophelia!
Oph
0
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
King
0
How long hath she been thus?
Oph
0
I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
King
0
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
Queen
0
Alack, what noise is this?
King
0
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Mess
0
Save Yourself, my lord:
Queen
0
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
King
0
The doors are broke.
Laer
0
Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
All
0
No, let's come in!
Laer
0
I pray you give me leave.
All
0
We will, we will!
Laer
0
I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
Queen
0
Calmly, good Laertes.
Laer
0
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
King
0
What is the cause, Laertes,
Laer
0
Where is my father?
King
0
Dead.
Queen
0
But not by him!
King
0
Let him demand his fill.
Laer
0
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
King
0
Who shall stay you?
Laer
0
My will, not all the world!
King
0
Good Laertes,
Laer
0
None but his enemies.
King
0
Will you know them then?
Laer
0
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
King

Why, now You speak
Laer

How now? What noise is that?
Oph

Laer

Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,

You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
Laer

This nothing's more than matter.
Oph
0
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
Laer
0
A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
Oph
0
There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
Laer

Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Oph

Laer

Do you see this, O God?
King

Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Laer

Let this be so.
King

So you shall;
Hor

What are they that would speak with me?

Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
Hor

Let them come in.

Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:

From Hamlet? Who brought them?
Mess

Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
King

Laertes, you shall hear them.
Laer

Know you the hand?
King

'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
Laer

I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!

If it be so, Laertes

Ay my lord,

To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
Laer

My lord, I will be rul'd;
King

It falls right.
Laer
0
What part is that, my lord?
King
0
A very riband in the cap of youth-
Laer
0
A Norman was't?
King
0
A Norman.
Laer
0
Upon my life, Lamound.
King
0
The very same.
Laer
0
I know him well. He is the broach indeed
King
0
He made confession of you;
Laer
0
What out of this, my lord?
King
0
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Laer
0
Why ask you this?
King
0
Not that I think you did not love your father;
Laer
0
To cut his throat i' th' church!
King

No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;

I will do't!

Let's further think of this,

Drown'd! O, where?
Queen

There is a willow grows aslant a brook,

Alas, then she is drown'd?

Drown'd, drown'd.

So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.

Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting

That is most certain.

I beseech you.

Being thus benetted round with villanies,

How was this seal'd?

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

Why, what a king is this!

It will be short; the interim is mine,

No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.

It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.

Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot

What imports the nomination of this gentleman

Of Laertes?

[aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are

Of him, sir.
Osr
0
I know you are not ignorant-
Ham
0
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not

You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-

I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in

What's his weapon?
Osr
0
Rapier and dagger.
Ham
0
That's two of his weapons- but well.
Osr

The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
Ham

What call you the carriages?
Hor

[aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent

The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could

The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between

How if I answer no?

I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
Osr

Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
Ham
0
To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
Osr
0
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Ham
0
Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it

0
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,

I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.

In happy time.

You will lose this wager, my lord.

Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Ham
0
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
Laer
0
I am satisfied in nature,
Ham
0
I embrace it freely,
Laer
0
Come, one for me.
Ham
0
I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
Laer
0
You mock me, sir.
Ham
0
No, by this bad.
King
0
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
Ham
0
Very well, my lord.
King
0
I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
Laer
0
This is too heavy; let me see another.
Ham
0
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Osr
0
Ay, my good lord.
King
0
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
Ham
0
Come on, sir.
Laer
0
Come, my lord.                                They play.
Ham
0
One.
Laer
0
No.
Ham
0
Judgment!
Osr
0
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Laer
0
Well, again!
King
0
Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Ham
0
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Laer
0
A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
King
0
Our son shall win.
Queen
0
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Ham
0
Good madam!
King
0
Gertrude, do not drink.
Queen
0
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
King
0
[aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
Ham
0
I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
Queen
0
Come, let me wipe thy face.
Laer
0
My lord, I'll hit him now.
King
0
I do not think't.
Laer
0
[aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
Ham
0
Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
Laer
0
Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
Osr
0
Nothing neither way.
Laer
0
Have at you now!
King
0
Part them! They are incens'd.
Ham
0
Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.
Osr
0
Look to the Queen there, ho!
Hor
0
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
Osr
0
How is't, Laertes?
Laer
0
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
Ham
0
How does the Queen?
King
0
She sounds to see them bleed.
Queen
0
No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
Ham
0
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
Laer
0
It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
Ham
0
The point envenom'd too?
All
0
Treason! treason!
King
0
O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
Ham
0
Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
Laer

He is justly serv'd.
Ham

Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.

Never believe it.

As th'art a man,
