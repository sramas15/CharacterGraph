    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

    There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
    The swelling difference of your settled hate;
    Since we can not atone you, we shall see

    Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.
    I take my leave before I have begun,
    For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
    Lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;
    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
    I shall remember more. Bid him- ah, what?-
    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
    Alack, and what shall good old York there see
    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
    Therefore commend me; let him not come there
    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;
    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.          Exeunt

2
KING
JOHN OF GAUNT
UNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands;
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
    For Christian service and true chivalry,
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
    The deputy elected by the Lord.
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.

    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
    Henry Bolingbroke
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
    To his most royal person; hither come
    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd
    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;
    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet]
    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
    That from this castle's tottered battlements
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements
    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.

    And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
    I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
    I doubt not but to ride as fast as York;
    And never will I rise up from the ground
    Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone.

NG RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare
    This prison where I live unto the world
    And, for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
    Thus play I in one person many people,
    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
    And so I am. Then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;
    Then am I king'd again; and by and by
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

    Alack, and what shall good old York there see
    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
    Therefore commend me; let him not come there

    For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.
    As confident as is the falcon's flight
    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
    Not sick, although I have to do with death,
    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.
    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
    To reach at victory above my head,
    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,
    And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,

1
GAUNT
UNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands;
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
    For Christian service and true chivalry,
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

    T'one is my sovereign, whom both my oath

    Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
    Well, somewhat we must do.-Come, cousin,

    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,

    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
    The deputy elected by the Lord.
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.

    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;
    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet]
    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
    That from this castle's tottered battlements
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements
    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.

NG RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare
    This prison where I live unto the world
    And, for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
    Thus play I in one person many people,
    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
    And so I am. Then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;
    Then am I king'd again; and by and by
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

    Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong

    The slavish motive of recanting fear,
    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
    Lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;
    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
    I shall remember more. Bid him- ah, what?-
    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
    Alack, and what shall good old York there see
    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
    Therefore commend me; let him not come there
    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;
    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.          Exeunt

1
GAUNT

    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands;
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
    For Christian service and true chivalry,
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

SALISBURY
NG RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
    The deputy elected by the Lord.
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.
  SALISBURY.

    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
    Henry Bolingbroke
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
    To his most royal person; hither come
    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd
    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;
    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet]
    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
    That from this castle's tottered battlements
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements
    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.

NG RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare
    This prison where I live unto the world
    And, for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
    Thus play I in one person many people,
    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
    And so I am. Then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;
    Then am I king'd again; and by and by
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
    Alack, and what shall good old York there see
    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
    Therefore commend me; let him not come there
    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;
    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.          Exeunt

1
GAUNT
UNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands;
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
    For Christian service and true chivalry,
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
    The deputy elected by the Lord.
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.

    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
    Henry Bolingbroke
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
    To his most royal person; hither come
    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd
    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;
    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet]
    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
    That from this castle's tottered battlements
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements
    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.

NG RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare
    This prison where I live unto the world
    And, for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
    Thus play I in one person many people,
    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
    And so I am. Then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;
    Then am I king'd again; and by and by
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

    For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.
    As confident as is the falcon's flight
    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
    Not sick, although I have to do with death,
    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.
    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
    To reach at victory above my head,
    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,

    We are enforc'd to farm our royal realm;
    The revenue whereof shall furnish us
    For our affairs in hand. If that come short,
    Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
    Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
    They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold,

1
GAUNT
UNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands;
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
    For Christian service and true chivalry,
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
    The deputy elected by the Lord.
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.

    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
    Henry Bolingbroke
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
    To his most royal person; hither come
    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd
    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;
    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet]
    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
    That from this castle's tottered battlements
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements
    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.

NG RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare
    This prison where I live unto the world
    And, for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
    Thus play I in one person many people,
    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
    And so I am. Then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;
    Then am I king'd again; and by and by
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
    Lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;
    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
    I shall remember more. Bid him- ah, what?-
    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
    Alack, and what shall good old York there see
    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
    Therefore commend me; let him not come there
    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;
    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.          Exeunt

1
GAUNT
UNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
    And thus expiring do foretell of him:
    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall,
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands;
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,
    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
    For Christian service and true chivalry,
    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
    Dear for her reputation through the world,
    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
    How happy then were my ensuing death!

NG RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    In murders and in outrage boldly here;
    But when from under this terrestrial ball
    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,
    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
    Not able to endure the sight of day,
    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
    The deputy elected by the Lord.
    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.

    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
    Henry Bolingbroke
    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,
    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
    To his most royal person; hither come
    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
    Provided that my banishment repeal'd
    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;
    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
    Go, signify as much, while here we march
    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet]
    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,
    That from this castle's tottered battlements
    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.
    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
    With no less terror than the elements
    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock
    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;
    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.
    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.

NG RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare
    This prison where I live unto the world
    And, for because the world is populous
    And here is not a creature but myself,
    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.
    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
    My soul the father; and these two beget
    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
    And these same thoughts people this little world,
    In humours like the people of this world,
    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
    With scruples, and do set the word itself
    Against the word,
    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,
    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
    That many have and others must sit there;
    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    Of such as have before endur'd the like.
    Thus play I in one person many people,
    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
    And so I am. Then crushing penury
    Persuades me I was better when a king;
    Then am I king'd again; and by and by
    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd
    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]
    Music do I hear?
    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is
    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
    So is it in the music of men's lives.
    And here have I the daintiness of ear
    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;
    But, for the concord of my state and time,
    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:
    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,
    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,
    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;
    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Now God in heaven forbid!
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Despair not, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Who shall hinder me?
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Here comes the Duke of York.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.
  YORK. 
0
RK. He was-why so go all which way it will!
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
  YORK. 
0
RK. What is't, knave?
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died.
  YORK. 
0
RK. God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Thither will I with you; for little office
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. No; I will to Ireland to his Majesty.
  BUSHY.

  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy,
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
  ROSS. 
0
SS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster';
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious uncle!-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Tut, tut!
  BOLINGBROKE 
0
LINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Even in condition of the worst degree-
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.
  YORK. 
0
RK. My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
  YORK. 
0
RK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bring forth these men.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
  YORK. 
0
RK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,
  KING

NG RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak.
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My liege, one word.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. He does me double wrong
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief,
  YORK. 
0
RK. The time hath been,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself
  PIERCY. 
0
ERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Royally!
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Yes, my good lord,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. What says his Majesty?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Sorrow and grief of heart
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Stand all apart,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Well you deserve. They well deserve to have
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Yea, my good lord.
  KING

NG RICHARD. Then I must not say no.         Flourish. Exeunt

DY. Madam, we'll play at bowls.
  QUEEN.

EEN. 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
  LADY.

DY. Madam, we'll dance.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. My legs can keep no measure in delight,
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll tell tales.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of sorrow or of joy?
  LADY. 
0
DY. Of either, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of neither, girl;
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, I'll sing.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis well' that thou hast cause;

RDENER. Hold thy peace.
  SERVANT.

RVANT. What, are they dead?
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. They are; and Bolingbroke
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed?
  GARDENER.

RDENER. Depress'd he is already, and depos'd

0
EEN. O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
  GARDENER.

RDENER. Poor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of

MERLE. Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!

0
RREY. My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. 'Tis very true; you were in presence then,
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Surrey, thou liest.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Dishonourable boy!
  FITZWATER.

TZWATER. How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage
  CARLISLE.

RLISLE. That honourable day shall never be seen.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?
  CARLISLE.

RLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord.
  BOLINGBROKE.

RTHUMBERLAND. Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Fetch hither Richard, that in common view

  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
  YORK. 
0
RK. To do that office of thine own good will
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. No more; but that you read
  KING

RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, dispatch; read o'er these

RTHUMBERLAND. My lord-
  KING

  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Say that again.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Name it, fair cousin.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin! I am greater than a king;
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Yet ask.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. And shall I have?
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. You shall.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Then give me leave to go.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Whither?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
  ABBOT.

BOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
  CARLISLE.

MERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot
  ABBOT. 
0
BOT. My lord,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. This way the King will come; this is the way
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. A king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but little policy.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Then whither he goes thither let me go.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. So two, together weeping, make one woe.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. We make woe wanton with this fond delay.
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Where did I leave?
  DUCHESS. 
0
CHESS. At that sad stop, my lord,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
  YORK.

  YORK.

  DUCHESS. 
0
CHESS. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.
  YORK.

  YORK.

  YORK.

  AUMERLE.

MERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.
  YORK.

RK. No matter, then, who see it.
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;
  YORK.

RK. Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
  DUCHESS. 
0
CHESS. What should you fear?
  YORK.

RK. Bound to himself! What doth he with a bond
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. What is the matter, my lord?
  YORK.

RK. Ho! who is within there?
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. Why, York, what is it, my lord?
  YORK.

RK. Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. What is the matter?
  YORK. 
0
RK. Peace, foolish woman.
  DUCHESS. 
0
CHESS. I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle?
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. Good mother, be content; it is no more
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. Thy life answer!
  YORK.

RK. Bring me my boots. I will unto the King.
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amaz'd.
  YORK.

CHESS. Why, York, what wilt thou do?
  YORK.

RK. Thou fond mad woman,

CHESS. Hadst thou groan'd for him
  YORK.

RK. Make way, unruly woman!                             Exit

  KING

MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. O, let no noble eye profane a tear
    For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.
    As confident as is the falcon's flight
    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
    Not sick, although I have to do with death,
    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.
    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
    To reach at victory above my head,
    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,
    And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,

MOWBRAY

  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. Your will be done. This must my comfort be-
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
  MOWBRAY. 
1
MOWBRAY
WBRAY. A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. It boots thee not to be compassionate;
  MOWBRAY. 
1
MOWBRAY
WBRAY. Then thus I turn me from my countrv's light,
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. Return again, and take an oath with thee.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. I swear.
  MOWBRAY. 
1
MOWBRAY
WBRAY. And I, to keep all this.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy.
  MOWBRAY. 
1
MOWBRAY
WBRAY. No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor,
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. How long a time lies in one little word!

MOWBRAY

  KING 
1
MOWBRAY

  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. But not a minute, King, that thou canst give:
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.
  KING 
1
MOWBRAY
NG RICHARD. Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.
    Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

  AUMERLE. 
1
MOWBRAY
MERLE. Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,
  MARSHAL. 
1
MOWBRAY
RSHAL. My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride
  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. I have too few to take my leave of you,
  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. What is six winters? They are quickly gone.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. Call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
  GAUNT. 
1
MOWBRAY
UNT. The sullen passage of thy weary steps
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
MOWBRAY
LINGBROKE. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
  GAUNT.

  AUMERLE.

MOWBRAY
MERLE. Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,

MOWBRAY

  AUMERLE. 
1
MOWBRAY
MERLE. 'Farewell.'

  KING

  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. O, how that name befits my composition!
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Should dying men flatter with those that live?
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. No, no; men living flatter those that die.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
  KING

  GAUNT.

UNT. O, Spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
  KING

NG RICHARD. And let them die that age and sullens have;
  YORK.

  KING

RTHUMBERLAND. My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.
  KING

  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
  KING

  YORK.

  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter?
  YORK. 
0
RK. O my liege,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands
  YORK. 
0
RK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
  ROSS. 
0
SS. No good at all that I can do for him;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
  ROSS. 
0
SS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devis'd,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
  ROSS. 
0
SS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!
  ROSS. 
0
SS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
  NORTHUMBERLAND.

RTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
  ROSS. 
0

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

LLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Now God in heaven forbid!
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Despair not, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Who shall hinder me?
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Here comes the Duke of York.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.
  YORK. 
0
RK. He was-why so go all which way it will!
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
  YORK. 
0
RK. What is't, knave?
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died.
  YORK. 
0
RK. God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Thither will I with you; for little office
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. No; I will to Ireland to his Majesty.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Well, we may meet again.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. I fear me, never.                                Exeunt
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy,
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
  ROSS. 
0
SS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster';
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious uncle!-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Tut, tut!
  BOLINGBROKE 
0
LINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Even in condition of the worst degree-
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.
  YORK. 
0
RK. My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
  YORK. 
0
RK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bring forth these men.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
  YORK. 
0
RK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,
  KING

NG RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak.
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My liege, one word.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. He does me double wrong
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief,
  YORK. 
0
RK. The time hath been,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself
  PIERCY. 
0
ERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Royally!
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Yes, my good lord,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. What says his Majesty?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Sorrow and grief of heart
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Stand all apart,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Well you deserve. They well deserve to have
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Yea, my good lord.
  KING

  QUEEN.

DY. Madam, we'll dance.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. My legs can keep no measure in delight,
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll tell tales.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of sorrow or of joy?
  LADY. 
0
DY. Of either, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of neither, girl;
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, I'll sing.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis well' that thou hast cause;

  SERVANT.

  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. They are; and Bolingbroke
  SERVANT.

RVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed?
  GARDENER.

RDENER. Depress'd he is already, and depos'd

EEN. O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
  GARDENER.

RDENER. Pardon me, madam; little joy have

RDENER. Poor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,

LINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.
  BAGOT.

GOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
  BAGOT.

GOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
  PERCY.

RCY. Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true

MERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of

RREY. My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. 'Tis very true; you were in presence then,
  SURREY.

RREY. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
  FITZWATER.

TZWATER. Surrey, thou liest.
  SURREY.

RREY. Dishonourable boy!
  FITZWATER.

TZWATER. How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage
  CARLISLE.

RLISLE. That honourable day shall never be seen.
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?
  CARLISLE.

RLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord.

LINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
    Little are we beholding to your love,
    And little look'd for at your helping hands.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. To do that office of thine own good will
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown?
  KING

YORK
NG RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;

1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. No more; but that you read

YORK
NG RICHARD. Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.
  NORTHUMBERLAND.

RTHUMBERLAND. My lord-
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Say that again.
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Name it, fair cousin.
  KING

LINGBROKE. Yet ask.
  KING

NG RICHARD. And shall I have?
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Whither?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1

LINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
  KING

                     Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard
  BOLINGBROKE.

    Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.
                    Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, the
  ABBOT. 
1

1
YORK
BOT. My lord,
  QUEEN.

  QUEEN. 
1

EEN. What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. A king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but little policy.
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. Then whither he goes thither let me go.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. So two, together weeping, make one woe.
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
  QUEEN.

YORK
EEN. Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. We make woe wanton with this fond delay.

YORK
CHESS. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,

RK. Where did I leave?
  DUCHESS.

CHESS. At that sad stop, my lord,

  DUCHESS. 
1
YORK
CHESS. Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
  YORK.

CHESS. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now
  AUMERLE.

MERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.

RK. No matter, then, who see it.
  AUMERLE. 
1
YORK
MERLE. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;

1
YORK
RK. Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
  DUCHESS. 
1
YORK
CHESS. What should you fear?

MERLE. I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.

RK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter?
  YORK. 
0
RK. O my liege,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands
  YORK. 
0
RK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
  ROSS. 
0
SS. No good at all that I can do for him;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
  ROSS. 
0
SS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devis'd,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
  ROSS. 
0
SS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!
  ROSS. 
0
SS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay
  ROSS. 
0
SS. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Now God in heaven forbid!
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Despair not, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Who shall hinder me?
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Here comes the Duke of York.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.
  YORK. 
0
RK. He was-why so go all which way it will!
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
  YORK. 
0
RK. What is't, knave?
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died.
  YORK. 
0
RK. God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Thither will I with you; for little office
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. No; I will to Ireland to his Majesty.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Well, we may meet again.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. I fear me, never.                                Exeunt
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy,
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
  ROSS. 
0
SS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster';
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious uncle!-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Tut, tut!
  BOLINGBROKE 
0
LINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Even in condition of the worst degree-
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.
  YORK. 
0
RK. My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
  YORK. 
0
RK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bring forth these men.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
  YORK. 
0
RK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak.
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My liege, one word.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. He does me double wrong
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief,
  YORK. 
0
RK. The time hath been,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself
  PIERCY. 
0
ERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Royally!
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Yes, my good lord,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. What says his Majesty?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Sorrow and grief of heart
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Stand all apart,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Well you deserve. They well deserve to have
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Yea, my good lord.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Then I must not say no.         Flourish. Exeunt
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. What sport shall we devise here in this garden
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll play at bowls.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll dance.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. My legs can keep no measure in delight,
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll tell tales.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of sorrow or of joy?
  LADY. 
0
DY. Of either, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of neither, girl;
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, I'll sing.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis well' that thou hast cause;
  LADY. 
0
DY. I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
  QUEEN.

EEN. And I could sing, would weeping do me good,

RDENER. Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,

RVANT. Why should we, in the compass of a pale,
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Hold thy peace.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. What, are they dead?
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. They are; and Bolingbroke
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed?
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Depress'd he is already, and depos'd
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Pardon me, madam; little joy have
  QUEEN.

EEN. Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Poor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of
  ANOTHER

OTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;

0
MERLE. Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. 'Tis very true; you were in presence then,
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Surrey, thou liest.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Dishonourable boy!
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. That honourable day shall never be seen.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord.
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom

RTHUMBERLAND. Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,

1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
    Little are we beholding to your love,
    And little look'd for at your helping hands.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. To do that office of thine own good will
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. No more; but that you read
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Must I do so? And must I ravel out
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, dispatch; read o'er these
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord-
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Say that again.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Name it, fair cousin.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin! I am greater than a king;
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Yet ask.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. And shall I have?
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. You shall.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Then give me leave to go.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Whither?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,
    That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
                     Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1

LINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
    Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.
                    Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, the
  ABBOT. 
1
YORK
BOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
  CARLISLE. 
1
YORK
RLISLE. The woe's to come; the children yet unborn
  AUMERLE. 
1

MERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot
  ABBOT. 
1
YORK
BOT. My lord,
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. This way the King will come; this is the way
  KING

YORK
NG RICHARD. Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. A king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but little policy.
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. Then whither he goes thither let me go.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. So two, together weeping, make one woe.
  QUEEN. 
1
YORK
EEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
  QUEEN. 
1

  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. Will the King come, that I may breathe my last
  YORK. 
0
RK. Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men
  YORK. 
0
RK. No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
  YORK. 
0
RK. The King is come; deal mildly with his youth,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. What comfort, man? How is't with aged Gaunt?
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. O, how that name befits my composition!
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Should dying men flatter with those that live?
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. No, no; men living flatter those that die.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. A lunatic lean-witted fool,
  GAUNT. 
0
UNT. O, Spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. And let them die that age and sullens have;
  YORK. 
0
RK. I do beseech your Majesty impute his words
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. What says he?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
  YORK. 
0
RK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter?
  YORK. 
0
RK. O my liege,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands
  YORK. 
0
RK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
  ROSS. 
0
SS. No good at all that I can do for him;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
  ROSS. 
0
SS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devis'd,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
  ROSS. 
0
SS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!
  ROSS. 
0
SS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay
  ROSS. 
0
SS. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Now God in heaven forbid!
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Despair not, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Who shall hinder me?
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Here comes the Duke of York.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.
  YORK. 
0
RK. He was-why so go all which way it will!
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
  YORK. 
0
RK. What is't, knave?
  SERVINGMAN. 
0
RVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died.
  YORK. 
0
RK. God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Thither will I with you; for little office
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. No; I will to Ireland to his Majesty.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. Well, we may meet again.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. I fear me, never.                                Exeunt
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy,
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
  ROSS. 
0
SS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster';
  BERKELEY. 
0
RKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious uncle!-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Tut, tut!
  BOLINGBROKE 
0
LINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Even in condition of the worst degree-
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused.
  ROSS. 
0
SS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
  WILLOUGHBY. 
0
LLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.
  YORK. 
0
RK. My lords of England, let me tell you this:
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
  YORK. 
0
RK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;
  CAPTAIN. 
0
PTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bring forth these men.
  BUSHY. 
0
SHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me
  GREEN. 
0
EEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
  YORK. 
0
RK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak.
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come
  SCROOP. 
0
ROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. My liege, one word.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. He does me double wrong
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord.
  YORK. 
0
RK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief,
  YORK. 
0
RK. The time hath been,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself
  PIERCY. 
0
ERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Royally!
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Yes, my good lord,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. What says his Majesty?
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Sorrow and grief of heart
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Stand all apart,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Well you deserve. They well deserve to have
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Yea, my good lord.
  KING 
0
NG RICHARD. Then I must not say no.         Flourish. Exeunt
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. What sport shall we devise here in this garden
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll play at bowls.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll dance.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. My legs can keep no measure in delight,
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, we'll tell tales.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of sorrow or of joy?
  LADY. 
0
DY. Of either, madam.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Of neither, girl;
  LADY. 
0
DY. Madam, I'll sing.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. 'Tis well' that thou hast cause;
  LADY. 
0
DY. I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. And I could sing, would weeping do me good,

RDENER. Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,

RVANT. Why should we, in the compass of a pale,
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Hold thy peace.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. What, are they dead?
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. They are; and Bolingbroke
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed?
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Depress'd he is already, and depos'd
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Pardon me, madam; little joy have
  QUEEN.

EEN. Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
  GARDENER. 
0
RDENER. Poor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
  BAGOT. 
0
GOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
  PERCY. 
0
RCY. Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of
  ANOTHER 
0
OTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. 'Tis very true; you were in presence then,
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. Surrey, thou liest.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Dishonourable boy!
  FITZWATER. 
0
TZWATER. How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
  AUMERLE. 
0
MERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. That honourable day shall never be seen.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?
  CARLISLE. 
0
RLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
0
LINGBROKE. Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom

RK. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to the

LINGBROKE. In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
  CARLISLE.

RLISLE. Marry, God forbid!

0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. Fetch hither Richard, that in common view

LINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,

1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
    Little are we beholding to your love,
    And little look'd for at your helping hands.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. To do that office of thine own good will
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. No more; but that you read
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Must I do so? And must I ravel out
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord, dispatch; read o'er these
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. My lord-
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Say that again.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Name it, fair cousin.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Fair cousin! I am greater than a king;
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Yet ask.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. And shall I have?
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. You shall.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Then give me leave to go.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Whither?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG RICHARD. Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
  BOLINGBROKE. 
1
YORK
LINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
  KING

  YORK. 
1

YORK
LINGBROKE. As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
  AUMERLE. 
1
YORK
MERLE. Where is the King?

1
YORK
LINGBROKE. What means our cousin that he stares and looks

1
YORK
MERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
