KING RICHARD
0
Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,
GAUNT
0
I have, my liege.
KING RICHARD
0
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him
GAUNT
0
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
KING RICHARD
0
Then call them to our presence: face to face
BOLINGBROKE
0
Many years of happy days befall
MOWBRAY
0
Each day still better other's happiness
KING RICHARD
0
We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,
BOLINGBROKE
0
First-heaven be the record to my speech!
MOWBRAY
0
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
MOWBRAY
0
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
KING RICHARD
0
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
BOLINGBROKE
0
Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true-
KING RICHARD
0
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
MOWBRAY
0
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
KING RICHARD
0
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and cars.
MOWBRAY
0
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
KING RICHARD
0
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;
GAUNT
0
To be a make-peace shall become my age.
KING RICHARD
0
And, Norfolk, throw down his.
GAUNT
0
When, Harry, when?
KING RICHARD
0
Norfolk, throw down; we bid.
MOWBRAY
0
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot;
KING RICHARD
0
Rage must be withstood:
MOWBRAY
0
Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,
KING RICHARD
0
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
BOLINGBROKE
0
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
KING RICHARD
0
We were not born to sue, but to command;
GAUNT
0
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
DUCHESS
0
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
GAUNT
0
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
DUCHESS
0
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
GAUNT
0
To God, the widow's champion and defence.
DUCHESS
0
Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
DUCHESS
1
MOWBRAY
Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
    Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.
    O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.
DUCHESS
1
MOWBRAY
Yet one word more- grief boundeth where it falls,
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
The Duke of Norfolk, spightfully and bold,
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
    For nothing but his Majesty's approach.
     The trumpets sound, and the KING enters with his nobles,
     GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and others. When they are set,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
In God's name and the King's, say who thou art,
MOWBRAY
1
MOWBRAY
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
What is thy name? and wherefore com'st thou hither
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
On pain of death, no person be so bold
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
The appellant in all duty greets your Highness,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
O, let no noble eye profane a tear
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
O, let no noble eye profane a tear
    For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.
    As confident as is the falcon's flight
    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
    Not sick, although I have to do with death,
    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.
    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
    To reach at victory above my head,
    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,
    And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive!
MOWBRAY
1
MOWBRAY
However God or fortune cast my lot,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Farewell, my lord, securely I espy
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
[To an officer] Go bear this lance to Thomas,
FIRST HERALD
1
MOWBRAY
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
SECOND HERALD
1
MOWBRAY
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
Sound trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Your will be done. This must my comfort be-
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
MOWBRAY
1
MOWBRAY
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
It boots thee not to be compassionate;
MOWBRAY
1
MOWBRAY
Then thus I turn me from my countrv's light,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Return again, and take an oath with thee.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
I swear.
MOWBRAY
1
MOWBRAY
And I, to keep all this.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy.
MOWBRAY
1
MOWBRAY
No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
How long a time lies in one little word!
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
I thank my liege that in regard of me
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
But not a minute, King, that thou canst give:
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.
    Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
                                  Flourish. Exit KING with train
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,
MARSHAL
1
MOWBRAY
My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
I have too few to take my leave of you,
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
What is six winters? They are quickly gone.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
Call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
All places that the eye of heaven visits
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
O, who can hold a fire in his hand
GAUNT
1
MOWBRAY
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way.
BOLINGBROKE
1
MOWBRAY
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
What said our cousin when you parted with him?
AUMERLE
1
MOWBRAY
'Farewell.'
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
GREEN
1
MOWBRAY
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts!
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
We will ourself in person to this war;
BUSHY
1
MOWBRAY
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Where lies he?
BUSHY
1
MOWBRAY
At Ely House.
KING RICHARD
1
MOWBRAY
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
ALL
1
MOWBRAY
Amen.                                              Exeunt
GAUNT
0
Will the King come, that I may breathe my last
YORK
0
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
GAUNT
0
O, but they say the tongues of dying men
YORK
0
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
GAUNT
0
Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,
YORK
0
The King is come; deal mildly with his youth,
QUEEN
0
How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?
KING RICHARD
0
What comfort, man? How is't with aged Gaunt?
GAUNT
0
O, how that name befits my composition!
KING RICHARD
0
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
GAUNT
0
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
KING RICHARD
0
Should dying men flatter with those that live?
GAUNT
0
No, no; men living flatter those that die.
KING RICHARD
0
Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.
GAUNT
0
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
KING RICHARD
0
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
GAUNT
0
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
KING RICHARD
0
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
GAUNT
0
O, Spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
KING RICHARD
0
And let them die that age and sullens have;
YORK
0
I do beseech your Majesty impute his words
KING RICHARD
0
Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.
KING RICHARD
0
What says he?
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Nay, nothing; all is said.
YORK
0
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
KING RICHARD
0
The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
YORK
0
How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
KING RICHARD
0
Why, uncle, what's the matter?
YORK
0
O my liege,
KING RICHARD
0
Think what you will, we seize into our hands
YORK
0
I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.
KING RICHARD
0
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
WILLOUGHBY
0
Barely in title, not in revenues.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Richly in both, if justice had her right.
ROSS
0
My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
WILLOUGHBY
0
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
ROSS
0
No good at all that I can do for him;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
ROSS
0
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;
WILLOUGHBY
0
And daily new exactions are devis'd,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
ROSS
0
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
WILLOUGHBY
0
The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
ROSS
0
He hath not money for these Irish wars,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!
ROSS
0
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
WILLOUGHBY
0
Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
ROSS
0
Be confident to speak, Northumberland.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay
ROSS
0
To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.
WILLOUGHBY
0
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
BUSHY
0
Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
QUEEN
0
To please the King, I did; to please myself
BUSHY
0
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
QUEEN
0
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
BUSHY
0
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
QUEEN
0
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd
GREEN
0
God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.
QUEEN
0
Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;
GREEN
0
That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power
QUEEN
0
Now God in heaven forbid!
GREEN
0
Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,
BUSHY
0
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
GREEN
0
We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester
QUEEN
0
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
BUSHY
0
Despair not, madam.
QUEEN
0
Who shall hinder me?
GREEN
0
Here comes the Duke of York.
QUEEN
0
With signs of war about his aged neck.
YORK
0
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
SERVINGMAN
0
My lord, your son was gone before I came.
YORK
0
He was-why so go all which way it will!
SERVINGMAN
0
My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
YORK
0
What is't, knave?
SERVINGMAN
0
An hour before I came, the Duchess died.
YORK
0
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
BUSHY
0
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.
GREEN
0
Besides, our nearness to the King in love
BAGOT
0
And that is the wavering commons; for their love
BUSHY
0
Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.
BAGOT
0
If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
GREEN
0
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.
BUSHY
0
Thither will I with you; for little office
BAGOT
0
No; I will to Ireland to his Majesty.
BUSHY
0
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
GREEN
0
Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes
BUSHY
0
Well, we may meet again.
BAGOT
0
I fear me, never.                                Exeunt
BOLINGBROKE
0
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Believe me, noble lord,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Of much less value is my company
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
It is my son, young Harry Percy,
PERCY
0
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Why, is he not with the Queen?
PERCY
0
No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
What was his reason?
PERCY
0
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
PERCY
0
No, my good lord; for that is not forgot
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
PERCY
0
My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
BOLINGBROKE
0
I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir
PERCY
0
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
ROSS
0
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
WILLOUGHBY
0
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
BERKELEY
0
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
BOLINGBROKE
0
My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster';
BERKELEY
0
Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
BOLINGBROKE
0
I shall not need transport my words by you;
YORK
0
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
BOLINGBROKE
0
My gracious uncle!-
YORK
0
Tut, tut!
YORK
0
Even in condition of the worst degree-
BOLINGBROKE
0
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
The noble Duke hath been too much abused.
ROSS
0
It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
WILLOUGHBY
0
Base men by his endowments are made great.
YORK
0
My lords of England, let me tell you this:
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
YORK
0
Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.
BOLINGBROKE
0
An offer, uncle, that we will accept.
YORK
0
It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,
CAPTAIN
0
My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
SALISBURY
0
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;
CAPTAIN
0
'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
SALISBURY
0
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Bring forth these men.
BUSHY
0
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
GREEN
0
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
BOLINGBROKE
0
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
YORK
0
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
BOLINGBROKE
0
Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,
KING RICHARD
0
Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
AUMERLE
0
Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
KING RICHARD
0
Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy
CARLISLE
0
Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king
AUMERLE
0
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
KING RICHARD
0
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
SALISBURY
0
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
AUMERLE
0
Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
KING RICHARD
0
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
AUMERLE
0
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
KING RICHARD
0
I had forgot myself; am I not King?
SCROOP
0
More health and happiness betide my liege
KING RICHARD
0
Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.
SCROOP
0
Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd
KING RICHARD
0
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.
SCROOP
0
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
KING RICHARD
0
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
SCROOP
0
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
AUMERLE
0
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
SCROOP
0
Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
AUMERLE
0
Where is the Duke my father with his power?
KING RICHARD
0
No matter where-of comfort no man speak.
CARLISLE
0
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
AUMERLE
0
My father hath a power; inquire of him,
KING RICHARD
0
Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come
SCROOP
0
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
KING RICHARD
0
Thou hast said enough.
AUMERLE
0
My liege, one word.
KING RICHARD
0
He does me double wrong
BOLINGBROKE
0
So that by this intelligence we learn
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
The news is very fair and good, my lord.
YORK
0
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief,
YORK
0
The time hath been,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
YORK
0
Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
BOLINGBROKE
0
I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself
PIERCY
0
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Royally!
PERCY
0
Yes, my good lord,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
BOLINGBROKE
0
[To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord,
YORK
0
Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,
KING RICHARD
0
[To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
KING RICHARD
0
Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
AUMERLE
0
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
KING RICHARD
0
O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine
AUMERLE
0
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
KING RICHARD
0
What must the King do now? Must he submit?
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
KING RICHARD
0
Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,
BOLINGBROKE
0
What says his Majesty?
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Sorrow and grief of heart
BOLINGBROKE
0
Stand all apart,
KING RICHARD
0
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
BOLINGBROKE
0
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
KING RICHARD
0
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
BOLINGBROKE
0
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
KING RICHARD
0
Well you deserve. They well deserve to have
BOLINGBROKE
0
Yea, my good lord.
KING RICHARD
0
Then I must not say no.         Flourish. Exeunt
QUEEN
0
What sport shall we devise here in this garden
LADY
0
Madam, we'll play at bowls.
QUEEN
0
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
LADY
0
Madam, we'll dance.
QUEEN
0
My legs can keep no measure in delight,
LADY
0
Madam, we'll tell tales.
QUEEN
0
Of sorrow or of joy?
LADY
0
Of either, madam.
QUEEN
0
Of neither, girl;
LADY
0
Madam, I'll sing.
QUEEN
0
'Tis well' that thou hast cause;
LADY
0
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
QUEEN
0
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
GARDENER
0
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
SERVANT
0
Why should we, in the compass of a pale,
GARDENER
0
Hold thy peace.
SERVANT
0
What, are they dead?
GARDENER
0
They are; and Bolingbroke
SERVANT
0
What, think you the King shall be deposed?
GARDENER
0
Depress'd he is already, and depos'd
QUEEN
0
O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
GARDENER
0
Pardon me, madam; little joy have
QUEEN
0
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
GARDENER
0
Poor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Call forth Bagot.
BAGOT
0
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
BAGOT
0
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
AUMERLE
0
Princes, and noble lords,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
AUMERLE
0
Excepting one, I would he were the best
FITZWATER
0
If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
AUMERLE
0
Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
FITZWATER
0
Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.
AUMERLE
0
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
PERCY
0
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
AUMERLE
0
An if I do not, may my hands rot of
ANOTHER LORD
0
I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
AUMERLE
0
Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!
SURREY
0
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
FITZWATER
0
'Tis very true; you were in presence then,
SURREY
0
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
FITZWATER
0
Surrey, thou liest.
SURREY
0
Dishonourable boy!
FITZWATER
0
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
AUMERLE
0
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
BOLINGBROKE
0
These differences shall all rest under gage
CARLISLE
0
That honourable day shall never be seen.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?
CARLISLE
0
As surely as I live, my lord.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
YORK
0
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to the
BOLINGBROKE
0
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
CARLISLE
0
Marry, God forbid!
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
YORK
0
I will be his conduct.                              Exit
BOLINGBROKE
0
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
    Little are we beholding to your love,
    And little look'd for at your helping hands.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
YORK
1
YORK
To do that office of thine own good will
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
I thought you had been willing to resign.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Are you contented to resign the crown?
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
No more; but that you read
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Must I do so? And must I ravel out
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
My lord-
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Say that again.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Name it, fair cousin.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Fair cousin! I am greater than a king;
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Yet ask.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
And shall I have?
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
You shall.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Then give me leave to go.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Whither?
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,
    That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
                     Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
BOLINGBROKE
1
YORK
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
    Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.
                    Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, the
ABBOT
1
YORK
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
CARLISLE
1
YORK
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn
AUMERLE
1
YORK
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
ABBOT
1
YORK
My lord,
QUEEN
1
YORK
This way the King will come; this is the way
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
QUEEN
1
YORK
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
A king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts,
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd;
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate
QUEEN
1
YORK
And must we be divided? Must we part?
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
QUEEN
1
YORK
Banish us both, and send the King with me.
NORTHUMBERLAND
1
YORK
That were some love, but little policy.
QUEEN
1
YORK
Then whither he goes thither let me go.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
QUEEN
1
YORK
So longest way shall have the longest moans.
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
QUEEN
1
YORK
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
KING RICHARD
1
YORK
We make woe wanton with this fond delay.
DUCHESS
1
YORK
My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
YORK
1
YORK
Where did I leave?
DUCHESS
1
YORK
At that sad stop, my lord,
YORK
1
YORK
Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,
DUCHESS
1
YORK
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
YORK
1
YORK
As in a theatre the eyes of men
DUCHESS
1
YORK
Here comes my son Aumerle.
YORK
1
YORK
Aumerle that was
DUCHESS
1
YORK
Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now
AUMERLE
1
YORK
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.
YORK
1
YORK
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
AUMERLE
1
YORK
For aught I know, my lord, they do.
YORK
1
YORK
You will be there, I know.
AUMERLE
1
YORK
If God prevent not, I purpose so.
YORK
1
YORK
What seal is that that without thy bosom?
AUMERLE
1
YORK
My lord, 'tis nothing.
YORK
1
YORK
No matter, then, who see it.
AUMERLE
1
YORK
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;
YORK
1
YORK
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
DUCHESS
1
YORK
What should you fear?
YORK
1
YORK
Bound to himself! What doth he with a bond
AUMERLE
1
YORK
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
YORK
1
YORK
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
DUCHESS
1
YORK
What is the matter, my lord?
YORK
1
YORK
Ho! who is within there?
DUCHESS
1
YORK
Why, York, what is it, my lord?
YORK
1
YORK
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
DUCHESS
0
What is the matter?
YORK
0
Peace, foolish woman.
DUCHESS
0
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle?
AUMERLE
0
Good mother, be content; it is no more
DUCHESS
0
Thy life answer!
YORK
0
Bring me my boots. I will unto the King.
DUCHESS
0
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amaz'd.
YORK
0
Give me my boots, I say.
DUCHESS
0
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
YORK
0
Thou fond mad woman,
DUCHESS
0
He shall be none;
YORK
0
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son
DUCHESS
0
Hadst thou groan'd for him
YORK
0
Make way, unruly woman!                             Exit
DUCHESS
0
After, Aumerle! Mount thee upon his horse;
BOLINGBROKE
0
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
PERCY
0
My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince,
BOLINGBROKE
0
And what said the gallant?
PERCY
0
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
BOLINGBROKE
0
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
AUMERLE
0
Where is the King?
BOLINGBROKE
0
What means our cousin that he stares and looks
AUMERLE
0
God save your Grace! I do beseech your Majesty,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
AUMERLE
0
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Intended or committed was this fault?
AUMERLE
0
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Have thy desire.
YORK
0
[Within] My liege, beware; look to thyself;
BOLINGBROKE
0
[Drawing] Villain, I'll make thee safe.
AUMERLE
0
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
YORK
0
[Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy King.
BOLINGBROKE
0
What is the matter, uncle? Speak;
YORK
0
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
AUMERLE
0
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd.
YORK
0
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
BOLINGBROKE
0
O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy!
YORK
0
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
DUCHESS
0
[Within] I What ho, my liege, for God's sake, let me in.
BOLINGBROKE
0
What shrill-voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry?
DUCHESS
0
[Within] A woman, and thine aunt, great King; 'tis I.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Our scene is alt'red from a serious thing,
YORK
0
If thou do pardon whosoever pray,
DUCHESS
0
O King, believe not this hard-hearted man!
YORK
0
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
DUCHESS
0
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Rise up, good aunt.
DUCHESS
0
Not yet, I thee beseech.
AUMERLE
0
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
YORK
0
Against them both, my true joints bended be.
DUCHESS
0
Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face;
BOLINGBROKE
0
Good aunt, stand up.
DUCHESS
0
do not say 'stand up';
YORK
0
Speak it in French, King, say 'pardonne moy.'
DUCHESS
0
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
BOLINGBROKE
0
Good aunt, stand up.
DUCHESS
0
I do not sue to stand;
BOLINGBROKE
0
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
DUCHESS
0
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
BOLINGBROKE
0
With all my heart
DUCHESS
0
A god on earth thou art.
BOLINGBROKE
0
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot,
DUCHESS
0
Come, my old son; I pray God make thee new.      Exeunt
EXTON
0
Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake?
SERVANT
0
These were his very words.
EXTON
0
'Have I no friend?' quoth he. He spake it twice
SERVANT
0
He did.
EXTON
0
And, speaking it, he wishtly look'd on me,
KING RICHARD
0
I have been studying how I may compare
GROOM
0
Hail, royal Prince!
KING RICHARD
0
Thanks, noble peer!
GROOM
0
I was a poor groom of thy stable, King,
KING RICHARD
0
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
GROOM
0
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
KING RICHARD
0
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
KEEPER
0
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
KING RICHARD
0
If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
GROOM
0
my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
KEEPER
0
My lord, will't please you to fall to?
KING RICHARD
0
Taste of it first as thou art wont to do.
KEEPER
0
My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton,
KING RICHARD
0
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
KEEPER
0
Help, help, help!
KING RICHARD
0
How now! What means death in this rude assault?
EXTON
0
As full of valour as of royal blood.
BOLINGBROKE
0
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
BOLINGBROKE
0
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
FITZWATER
0
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
BOLINGBROKE
0
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
PERCY
0
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
BOLINGBROKE
0
Carlisle, this is your doom:
EXTON
0
Great King, within this coffin I present
BOLINGBROKE
0
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
EXTON
0
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
BOLINGBROKE

They love not poison that do poison need,
