So shaken as we are, so wan with care,

My liege, this haste was hot in question
King
0
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
West
0
This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;
King
0
Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,
West
0
In faith,
King

Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, and mak'st me sin
West

This is his uncle's teaching, this Worcester,
King

But I have sent for him to answer this;
West

I will my liege.                                 Exeunt.
Fal
0
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
Prince
0
Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and
Fal
0
Indeed you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go
Prince
0
What, none?
Fal
0
No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to
Prince
0
Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.
Fal
0
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that
Prince
0
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of
Fal
0
By the Lord, thou say'st true, lad- and is not my hostess of
Prince
0
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle- and is not
Fal
0
How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy
Prince
0
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
Fal
0
Well, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
Prince
0
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
Fal
0
No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
Prince
0
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and
Fal
0
Yea, and so us'd it that, were it not here apparent that thou
Prince
0
No; thou shalt.
Fal
0
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
Prince
0
Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the
Fal
0
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour as
Prince
0
For obtaining of suits?
Fal
0
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean
Prince
0
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
Fal
0
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
Prince
0
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor
Fal
0
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art indeed the most
Prince
0
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and
Fal
0
O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to

0
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
Fal
0
Zounds, where thou wilt, lad! I'll make one. An I do not, call
Prince
0
I see a good amendment of life in thee- from praying to
Fal
0
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal. 'Tis no sin for a man to
Prince
0
Good morrow, Ned.
Poins
0
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? What
Prince
0
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his
Poins
0
Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the devil.
Prince
0
Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil.
Poins
0
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock
Fal
0
Hear ye, Yedward: if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you
Poins
0
You will, chops?
Fal
0
Hal, wilt thou make one?
Prince
0
Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.
Fal
0
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee,
Prince
0
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
Fal
0
Why, that's well said.
Prince
0
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
Fal
0
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
Prince
0
I care not.
Poins

Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone. I will

Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!

Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us to-morrow. I

How shall we part with them in setting forth?
Poins
0
Why, we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
Prince
0
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by
Poins
0
Tut! our horses they shall not see- I'll tie them in the
Prince
0
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
Poins
0
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred
Prince
0
Well, I'll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary
Poins
0
Farewell, my lord.                                Exit.

I know you all, and will awhile uphold

My blood hath been too cold and temperate,

Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves

My lord-
King

Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
North
0
Yea, my good lord.
Hot
0
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
Blunt
0
The circumstance considered, good my lord,
King
0
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
Hot
0
Revolted Mortimer?
King
0
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him!
Hot
0
An if the devil come and roar for them,
North
0
What, drunk with choler? Stay, and pause awhile.
Hot
0
Speak of Mortimer?
North
0
Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.
Wor
0
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
Hot
0
He will (forsooth) have all my prisoners;
Wor
0
I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaim'd
North
0
He was; I heard the proclamation.
Wor
0
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Hot
0
But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then
North
0
He did; myself did hear it.
Hot
0
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
Wor
0
Peace, cousin, say no more;
Hot
0
If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!
North
0
Imagination of some great exploit
Hot
0
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap
Wor
0
He apprehends a world of figures here,
Hot
0
I cry you mercy.
Wor
0
Those same noble Scots
Hot
0
I'll keep them all.
Wor
0
You start away.
Hot
0
Nay, I will! That is flat!
Wor
0
Hear you, cousin, a word.
Hot
0
All studies here I solemnly defy
Wor
0
Farewell, kinsman. I will talk to you
North
0
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Hot
0
Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods,
North
0
At Berkeley Castle.
Hot
0
You say true.
Wor
0
Nay, if you have not, to it again.
Hot
0
I have done, i' faith.
Wor
0
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
Hot
0
Of York, is it not?
Wor
0
True; who bears hard
Hot
0
I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.
North
0
Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.
Hot
0
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.
Wor
0
And so they shall.
Hot
0
In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
Wor
0
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
Hot
0
He does, he does! We'll be reveng'd on him.
Wor
0
Cousin, farewell. No further go in this
North
0
Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.

Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short

Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?

I prithee lend me this lantern to see my gelding in the

What, ho! chamberlain!
Cham

At hand, quoth pickpurse.
Gads

That's even as fair as- 'at hand, quoth the chamberlain'; for

Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told
Gads
0
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll

0
No, I'll none of it. I pray thee keep that for the hangman;
Gads

What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I'll make
Cham

What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water
Gads

She will, she will! Justice hath liquor'd her. We steal as in

Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night
Gads

Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as
Cham

Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
Gads

Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler

He is walk'd up to the top of the hill. I'll go seek him.

I am accurs'd to rob in that thief's company. The rascal hath

Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 'Sblood,

Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be

So I do, against my will.

Case ye, case ye! On with your vizards! There's money of the

You lie, ye rogue! 'Tis going to the King's tavern.

There's enough to make us all.

0
To be hang'd.

Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned
Peto

How many be there of them?
Gads
0
Some eight or ten.
Fal
0
Zounds, will they not rob us?
Prince

What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
Fal
0
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no

Well, we leave that to the proof.

Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge. When thou

Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I. Every man to

Come, neighbour.
Thieves

Jesus bless us!

Strike! down with them! cut the villains' throats! Ah,

O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
Fal

Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs;

The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou and I

Stand close! I hear them coming.

Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.

Your money!

Villains!

Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse.

Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
Serv

One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
Hot

What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
Serv
0
It is, my lord.
Hot

That roan shall be my throne.

But hear you, my lord.

What is it carries you away?

Why, my horse, my love- my horse!

So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.

Come, come, you paraquito, answer me

Do you not love me? do you not indeed?

Come, wilt thou see me ride?

How? so far?

Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:

It must of force.                                Exeunt.

Forsooth, five years, and as much as to-

A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! Marry and

You rogue, here's lime in this sack too! There is nothing but

How now, woolsack? What mutter you?
Fal

A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a

Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
Fal

Are not you a coward? Answer me to that- and Poins there?
Poins

Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the

I call thee coward? I'll see thee damn'd ere I call thee

O villain! thy lips are scarce wip'd since thou drunk'st

All is one for that. (He drinketh.) A plague of all cowards

What's the matter?
Fal
0
What's the matter? There be four of us here have ta'en a

Where is it, Jack? Where is it?
Fal
0
Where is it, Taken from us it is. A hundred upon poor four of
Prince
0
What, a hundred, man?
Fal
0
I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them
Prince
0
Speak, sirs. How was it?
Gads
0
We four set upon some dozen-
Fal
0
Sixteen at least, my lord.
Gads
0
And bound them.
Peto
0
No, no, they were not bound.
Fal
0
You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew
Gads
0
As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us-
Fal
0
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
Prince
0
What, fought you with them all?
Fal
0
All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with
Prince
0
Pray God you have not murd'red some of them.
Fal
0
Nay, that's past praying for. I have pepper'd two of them. Two
Prince
0
What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.
Fal
0
Four, Hal. I told thee four.
Poins
0
Ay, ay, he said four.
Fal
0
These four came all afront and mainly thrust at me. I made me

0
Seven? Why, there were but four even now.
Fal
0
In buckram?
Poins
0
Ay, four, in buckram suits.
Fal
0
Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
Prince

[aside to Poins] Prithee let him alone. We shall have more

0
Dost thou hear me, Hal?
Prince
0
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
Fal
0
Do so, for it is worth the list'ning to. These nine in buckram
Prince
0
So, two more already.
Fal
0
Their points being broken-
Poins
0
Down fell their hose.
Fal
0
Began to give me ground; but I followed me close, came in,
Prince

O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two!
Fal
0
But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in

These lies are like their father that begets them- gross as

What, art thou mad? art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?
Prince

Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green when
Poins
0
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
Fal
0
What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were at the strappado or

We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were

Come, let's hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now?
Fal
0
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear
Prince

Content- and the argument shall be thy running away.
Fal
0
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
Host

O Jesu, my lord the Prince!
Prince
0
How now, my lady the hostess? What say'st thou to me?
Host

Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door
Prince

Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him

0
What manner of man is he?
Host
0
An old man.
Fal

What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him
Prince
0
Prithee do, Jack.
Fal
0
Faith, and I'll send him packing.
Prince
0
Now, sirs. By'r Lady, you fought fair; so did you, Peto; so
Bard
0
Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
Prince
0
Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so
Peto
0
Why, he hack'd it with his dagger, and said he would swear
Bard
0
Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them
Prince

O villain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago
Bard

My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these

I do.
Bard

What think you they portend?
Prince
0
Hot livers and cold purses.

Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.

No, if rightly taken, halter.

You have hit it.

So did he never the sparrow.

Well, that rascal hath good metal in him; he will not run.
Prince
0
Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for
Fal
0
A-horseback, ye cuckoo! but afoot he will not budge a foot.
Prince
0
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one

Why then, it is like, if there come a hot June, and this

0
By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we shall have

Not a whit, i' faith. I lack some of thy instinct.

Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to

Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the

Shall I? Content. This chair shall be my state, this dagger my

Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.

For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen!

A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful

Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll

Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,

Well, here I am set.

0
And here I stand. Judge, my masters.

Now, Harry, whence come you?
Fal

My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er look on me.

O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
Prince
0
Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick!
Host
0
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come
Fal
0
Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a
Prince
0
And thou a natural coward without instinct.
Fal
0
I deny your major. If you will deny the sheriff, so; if not,
Prince
0
Go hide thee behind the arras. The rest walk, up above.
Fal
0
Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore
Prince
0
Call in the sheriff.
Sher
0
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Prince
0
What men?
Sher
0
One of them is well known, my gracious lord-
Carrier
0
As fat as butter.
Prince
0
The man, I do assure you, is not here,
Sher
0
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Prince
0
It may be so. If he have robb'd these men,
Sher
0
Good night, my noble lord.
Prince
0
I think it is good morrow, is it not?
Sher
0
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
Prince
0
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go call him
Peto
0
Falstaff! Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a
Prince
0
Hark how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
Peto
0
Nothing but papers, my lord.
Prince
0
Let's see whit they be. Read them.
Peto
0
[reads] 'Item. A capon. . . . . . . . . . . . .  ii s. ii d.
Prince
0
O monstrous! but one halfpennyworth of bread to this
Peto
0
Good morrow, good my lord.
Mort
0
These promises are fair, the parties sure,
Hot
0
Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
Glend
0
No, here it is.
Hot
0
And you in hell, as oft as he hears
Glend
0
I cannot blame him. At my nativity
Hot
0
Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your
Glend
0
I say the earth did shake when I was born.
Hot
0
And I say the earth was not of my mind,
Glend
0
The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
Hot
0
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
Glend
0
Cousin, of many men
Hot
0
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh. I'll to dinner.
Mort
0
Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
Glend
0
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Hot
0
Why, so can I, or so can any man;
Glend
0
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.
Hot
0
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil-
Mort
0
Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
Glend
0
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Hot
0
Home without boots, and in foul weather too?
Glend
0
Come, here's the map. Shall we divide our right
Mort
0
The Archdeacon hath divided it
Glend
0
A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;
Hot
0
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
Glend
0
Not wind? It shall, it must! You see it doth.
Mort
0
Yea, but
Wor
0
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
Hot
0
I'll have it so. A little charge will do it.
Glend
0
I will not have it alt'red.
Hot
0
Will not you?
Glend
0
No, nor you shall not.
Hot
0
Who shall say me nay?
Glend
0
No, that will I.
Hot
0
Let me not understand you then; speak it in Welsh.
Glend
0
I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
Hot
0
Marry,
Glend
0
Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
Hot
0
I do not care. I'll give thrice so much land
Glend
0
The moon shines fair; you may away by night.
Mort
0
Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
Hot
0
I cannot choose. Sometimes he angers me
Mort
0
In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
Wor
0
In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,
Hot
0
Well, I am school'd. Good manners be your speed!
Mort
0
This is the deadly spite that angers me-
Glend
0
My daughter weeps; she will not part with you;
Mort
0
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Glend
0
She is desperate here. A peevish self-will'd harlotry,
Mort
0
I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh
Glend
0
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
Mort
0
O, I am ignorance itself in this!
Glend
0
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
Mort
0
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing.
Glend
0
Do so,
Hot
0
Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down. Come, quick,
Hot
0
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
Hot
0
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
Hot
0
No.
Hot
0
Neither! 'Tis a woman's fault.
Hot
0
To the Welsh lady's bed.
Hot
0
Peace! she sings.
Hot
0
Not yours, in good sooth? Heart! you swear like a
Hot
0
'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast-teacher. An
Glend
0
Come, come, Lord Mortimer. You are as slow
Mort
0
With all my heart.
King
0
Lords, give us leave. The Prince of Wales and I
Prince
0
So please your Majesty, I would I could
King
0
God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,
Prince
0
I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
King
0
For all the world,
Prince
0
Do not think so. You shall not find it so.
King
0
A hundred thousand rebels die in this!
Blunt
0
So hath the business that I come to speak of.
King
0
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
Fal
0
Bardolph, am I not fall'n away vilely since this last action?
Bard
0
Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.
Fal
0
Why, there is it! Come, sing me a bawdy song; make me merry. I
Bard
0
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of
Fal
0
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life. Thou art our
Bard
0
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
Fal
0
No, I'll be sworn. I make as good use of it as many a man doth
Bard
0
'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
Fal
0
God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burn'd.
Host
0
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I
Fal
0
Ye lie, hostess. Bardolph was shav'd and lost many a hair, and
Host
0
Who, I? No; I defy thee! God's light, I was never call'd so
Fal
0
Go to, I know you well enough.
Host
0
No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir
Fal
0
Dowlas, filthy dowlas! I have given them away to bakers'
Host
0
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.
Fal
0
He had his part of it; let him pay.
Host
0
He? Alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
Fal
0
How? Poor? Look upon his face. What call you rich? Let them
Host
0
O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft,
Fal
0
How? the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup. 'Sblood, an he were
Bard
0
Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
Host
0
My lord, I pray you hear me.
Prince
0
What say'st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband?
Host
0
Good my lord, hear me.
Fal
0
Prithee let her alone and list to me.
Prince
0
What say'st thou, Jack?
Fal
0
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and had my
Prince
0
What didst thou lose, Jack?
Fal
0
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? Three or four bonds of forty pound
Prince
0
A trifle, some eightpenny matter.
Host
0
So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so;
Prince
0
What! he did not?
Host
0
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
Fal
0
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune, nor no
Host
0
Say, what thing? what thing?
Fal
0
What thing? Why, a thing to thank God on.
Host
0
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it!
Fal
0
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
Host
0
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
Fal
0
What beast? Why, an otter.
Prince
0
An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?
Fal
0
Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to
Host
0
Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows
Prince
0
Thou say'st true, hostess, and he slanders thee most
Host
0
So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you ought
Prince
0
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
Fal
0
A thousand pound, Hal? A million! Thy love is worth a million;
Host
0
Nay, my lord, he call'd you Jack and said he would cudgel
Fal
0
Did I, Bardolph?
Bard
0
Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
Fal
0
Yea. if he said my ring was copper.
Prince
0
I say, 'tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
Fal
0
Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare; but as
Prince
0
And why not as the lion?
Fal
0
The King himself is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think
Prince
0
O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees!
Fal
0
Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency
Prince
0
It appears so by the story.
Fal
0
Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready breakfast. Love thy
Prince
0
O my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee.
Fal
0
O, I do not like that paying back! 'Tis a double labour.
Prince
0
I am good friends with my father, and may do anything.
Fal
0
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and do it
Bard
0
Do, my lord.
Prince
0
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
Fal
0
I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find one that can
Prince
0
Bardolph!
Bard
0
My lord?
Prince
0
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,
Fal
0
Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come.
Hot
0
Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth
Doug
0
Thou art the king of honour.
Hot
0
Do so, and 'tis well.-
Messenger
0
These letters come from your father.
Hot
0
Letters from him? Why comes he not himself?
Mess
0
He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
Hot
0
Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
Mess
0
His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.
Wor
0
I prithee tell me, doth he keep his bed?
Mess
0
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,
Wor
0
I would the state of time had first been whole
Hot
0
Sick now? droop now? This sickness doth infect
Wor
0
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
Hot
0
A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off.
Doug
0
Faith, and so we should;
Hot
0
A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,
Wor
0
But yet I would your father had been here.
Hot
0
You strain too far.
Doug
0
As heart can think. There is not such a word
Hot
0
My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul.
Ver
0
Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
Hot
0
No harm. What more?
Ver
0
And further, I have learn'd
Hot
0
He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
Ver
0
All furnish'd, all in arms;
Hot
0
No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March,
Ver
0
There is more news.
Doug
0
That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
Wor
0
Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
Hot
0
What may the King's whole battle reach unto?
Ver
0
To thirty thousand.
Hot
0
Forty let it be.
Doug
0
Talk not of dying. I am out of fear
Fal
0
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a bottle of
Bard
0
Will you give me money, Captain?
Fal
0
Lay out, lay out.
Bald
0
This bottle makes an angel.
Fal
0
An if it do, take it for thy labour; an if it make twenty,
Bard
0
I Will, Captain. Farewell.                         Exit.
Fal
0
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a sous'd gurnet. I
Prince

How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt?
Fal
0
What, Hal? How now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in
West
0
Faith, Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were there, and
Fal
0
Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.
Prince
0
I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already
Fal
0
Mine, Hal, mine.
Prince
0
I did never see such pitiful rascals.
Fal
0
Tut, tut! good enough to toss; food for powder, food for
West
0
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare-
Fal
0
Faith, for their poverty, I know, not where they had that; and
Prince
0
No, I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on the
Fal
0
What, is the King encamp'd?
West
0
He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too long.
Fal
0
Well,
Hot
0
We'll fight with him to-night.
Wor
0
It may not be.
Doug
0
You give him then advantage.
Ver
0
Not a whit.
Hot
0
Why say you so? Looks he no for supply?
Ver
0
So do we.
Hot
0
His is certain, ours 's doubtful.
Wor
0
Good cousin, be advis'd; stir not to-night.
Ver
0
Do not, my lord.
Doug
0
You do not counsel well.
Ver
0
Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life-
Doug
0
Yea, or to-night.
Ver
0
Content.
Hot
0
To-night, say I.
Hot
0
So are the horses of the enemy,
Wor
0
The number of the King exceedeth ours.
Blunt
0
I come with gracious offers from the King,
Hot
0
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God
Blunt
0
And God defend but still I should stand so,
Hot
0
The King is kind; and well we know the King
Hot
0
Then to the point.
Blunt
0
Shall I return this answer to the King?
Hot
0
Not so, Sir Walter. We'll withdraw awhile.
Blunt
0
I would you would accept of grace and love.
Hot
0
And may be so we shall.
Blunt
0
Pray God you do.
Arch
0
Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
Arch
0
Like enough you do.
Arch
0
No, Mortimer is not there.
Arch
0
And so there is; but yet the King hath drawn
Arch

I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
King

How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Prince

The southern wind
King
0
Theft with the losers let it sympathize,
Wor
0
Hear me, my liege.
King
0
You have not sought it! How comes it then,
Fal
0
Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
Prince
0
Peace, chewet, peace!
Wor
0
It pleas'd your Majesty to turn your looks
King
0
These things, indeed, you have articulate,
Prince
0
In both our armies there is many a soul
King
0
And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
Prince
0
It will not be accepted, on my life.
King
0
Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
Fal
0
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so!
Prince
0
Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship.
Fal
0
I would 'twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.
Prince
0
Why, thou owest God a death.
Fal
0
'Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay him before his day.
Wor
0
O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
Ver
0
'Twere best he did.
Wor
0
Then are we all undone.
Ver
0
Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so.
Hot
0
My uncle is return'd.
Wor
0
The King will bid you battle presently.
Doug
0
Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland.
Hot
0
Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
Doug
0
Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
Wor
0
There is no seeming mercy in the King.
Hot
0
Did you beg any, God forbid!
Wor
0
I told him gently of our grievances,
Doug
0
Arm, gentlemen! to arms! for I have thrown
Wor

The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the King

0
O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
Hot
0
Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
Mess
0
My lord, here are letters for you.
Hot
0
I cannot read them now.-
Mess
0
My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.
Hot
0
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,
Hot
0
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,
    For I profess not talking. Only this-
    Let each man do his best; and here draw I
    A sword whose temper I intend to stain
    With the best blood that I can meet withal
    In the adventure of this perilous day.
    Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
    Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
    And by that music let us all embrace;
    For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
    A second time do such a courtesy.
                          Here they embrace. The trumpets sound.
                                                       [Exeunt.]
Blunt

What is thy name, that in the battle thus
Doug
0
Know then my name is Douglas,
Blunt
0
They tell thee true.
Doug
0
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
Blunt
0
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
Blunt
0
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
    And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
    Lord Stafford's death.
Hot
0
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
Doug
0
All's done, all's won. Here breathless lies the King.
Hot
0
Where?
Doug
0
Here.
Hot
0
This, Douglas? No. I know this face full well.
Doug
0
A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
Hot
0
The King hath many marching in his coats.
Doug
0
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;

0
Up and away!

Though I could scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot
Prince

What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.

He is indeed, and living to kill thee.
Fal
0
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st not my

Give it me. What, is it in the case?
Fal
0
Ay, Hal. 'Tis hot, 'tis hot. There's that will sack a city.
Fal
0
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do come in my

I prithee,

Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
Prince
0
I do beseech your Majesty make up,
King
0
I will do so.
West
0
Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
Prince
0
Lead me, my lord, I do not need your help;
John
0
We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,
Prince
0
By God, thou hast deceiv'd me, Lancaster!
King

I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
Prince

O, this boy

0
Another king? They grow like Hydra's heads.
King

The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart
Doug

I fear thou art another counterfeit;
Doug
1
PRINCE
I fear thou art another counterfeit;

For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart!

Embowell'd? If thou embowel me to-day, I'll give you leave to
Prince

Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
John

But, soft! whom have we here?
Prince

I did; I saw him dead,
Fal
0
No, that's certain! I am not a double man; but if I be not
Prince

Why, Percy I kill'd myself, and saw thee dead!

Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I

This is the strangest tale that ever I beard.

This is the strangest fellow, brother John.

Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.

What I have done my safety urg'd me to;

Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too;

With all my heart.

I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,
