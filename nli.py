# # Natural language inference
# 
# Chris Potts, for [Stanford's CS224u: Natural language understanding](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)

# In the context of NLP/NLU, Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the
# task of predicting the logical relationships between words, phrases,
# sentences, (paragraphs, documents, ...). Such relationships are
# crucial for all kinds of reasoning in natural language: arguing,
# debating, problem solving, summarization, extrapolation, and so
# forth.
# 
# NLI is a great task for this course. It requires serious linguistic
# analysis to do well, there are good (albeit small) publicly
# available data sets, and there are some natural baselines that help
# with getting a model up and running, and with understanding the
# performance of more sophisticated approaches.
# 
# NLI was also the topic of [Bill's
# thesis](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/papers/nli-diss.pdf) (he
# popularized the name "NLI"), so you can forever endear yourself to
# him by working on it!
# 
# The purpose of this codebook is to introduce the problem of NLI more
# fully in the context of the [SemEval 2014 semantic relatedness
# task](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1/). This data set is
# called "Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge" or, for better
# or worse, "SICK". It's [freely available from the SemEval
# site](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1/index.php?id=data-and-tools),
# but we're going to work with a parsed version created by [Sam
# Bowman](http://stanford.edu/~sbowman/) as part of [his research on
# neural models of semantic
# composition](https://github.com/sleepinyourhat/vector-entailment/releases/tag/W15-R1).
# This data is in the subfolder `nli-data` of this Github repository.
# 
# This codebook explores two general approaches: a standard
# classifier, and a shallow neural network using distributed
# representations.
# 
# The [Classifier training and
# assessment](#Classifier-training-and-assessment) section also serves
# as a general illustration of how to take advantage of the
# [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) functions for doing
# feature selection, cross-validation, hyper-parameter optimization,
# and evaluation in the context of multi-class classification. That
# code could be easily modified to work with any classification
# problem.

# ## Working with the parsed SICK data

# Our parsed version of the SICK data contains triples like this
# (tab-separated fields):
#     
# `
# ENTAILMENT  ( ( A child ) ( is ( playing ( in ( a yard ) ) ) ) )  ( ( A child ) ( is playing ) )
# `
# 
# `
# NEUTRAL  ( ( A child ) ( is ( playing ( in ( a yard ) ) ) ) )  ( ( A child ) ( is ( wearing ( blue jeans ) ) ) )
# `
# 
# `
# CONTRADICTION  ( ( A child ) ( is ( playing ) ) )  ( ( A child ) ( is sleeping ) )
# `
# 
# The brackets encode a label-free constituency structure of each
# sentence. The three labels on the left are the classes that we want
# to learn to predict. We'll frequently need access to them, so let's
# define them as a list:

# In[3]:

LABELS = ['ENTAILMENT', 'CONTRADICTION', 'NEUTRAL']


# ### Trees

# The baseline models that I define here ignore all of the tree
# structure, but you'll likely want to take advantage of it. So the
# following function can be used to turn bracketed strings like the
# above into tuples of tuples encoding the syntactic structure.

# In[4]:

WORD_RE = re.compile(r"([^ \(\)]+)", re.UNICODE)

def str2tree(s):
    """Turns labeled bracketing s into a tree structure (tuple of tuples)"""
    s = WORD_RE.sub(r'"\1",', s)
    s = s.replace(")", "),").strip(",")
    s = s.strip(",")
    return eval(s)


# Here's an example:

# In[5]:

# if __name__ == '__main__': # Prevent this example from loading on import of this module.
    
#     print str2tree("( ( A child ) ( is ( playing ( in ( a yard ) ) ) ) )")


# For baseline models, we often want just the words, also called
# terminal nodes or _leaves_. This function gives us access to them as
# a list:

# In[6]:

def leaves(t):
    """Returns all of the words (terminal nodes) in tree t"""
    words = []
    for x in t:
        if isinstance(x, str):
            words.append(x)
        else:
            words += leaves(x)
    return words


# An example:

# In[7]:

# if __name__ == '__main__': # Prevent this example from loading on import of this module.
    
#     t = str2tree("( ( A child ) ( is ( playing ( in ( a yard ) ) ) ) )")
#     print leaves(t)


# ### Readers

# To make it easy to run through the corpus, let's define general
# readers for the SICK data. The general function for this yields
# triples consisting of the label, the left tree, and the right tree,
# as parsed by `str2tree`:

# In[8]:

data_dir = 'nli-data/'

def sick_reader(src_filename):
    for example in csv.reader(file(src_filename), delimiter="\t"):
        label, t1, t2 = example[:3]
        if not label.startswith('%'): # Some files use leading % for comments.           
            yield (label, str2tree(t1), str2tree(t2))


# Now we define separate readers for the training and development
# data:

# In[9]:

def sick_train_reader():
    return sick_reader(src_filename=data_dir+"SICK_train_parsed.txt")

def sick_dev_reader():
    return sick_reader(src_filename=data_dir+"SICK_trial_parsed.txt")


# Eventually, we'll want a test-set reader. As Bill discussed in
# class, though, __we swear on our honor as scholars that we won't use
# this data until system development is complete and we are ready to
# conduct our final assessment__!

# In[10]:

def sick_test_reader():
    return sick_reader(src_filename=data_dir+"SICK_test_parsed.txt")


# ## MaxEnt classifier approach

# ### Baseline classifier features

# The first baseline we define is the _word overlap_ baseline. It
# simply uses as features the words that appear in both sentences.

# In[11]:

def word_overlap_features(t1, t2):
    overlap = [w1 for w1 in leaves(t1) if w1 in leaves(t2)]
    return Counter(overlap)


# Another popular baseline is to use as features the full
# cross-product of words from both sentences:

# In[12]:

def word_cross_product_features(t1, t2):
    return Counter([(w1, w2) for w1, w2 in itertools.product(leaves(t1), leaves(t2))])


# Both of these feature functions return count dictionaries mapping
# feature names to the number of times they occur in the data. This is
# the representation we'll work with throughout; scikit-learn will
# handle the further processing it needs to build linear classifiers.
# 
# Naturally, you can do better than these feature functions! Both of
# these feature classes might be useful even in a more advanced model,
# though.

# ### Classifier training and assessment

# The first step in training a classifier is using a feature function
# like the one above to turn the data into a list of _training
# instances_: feature representations and their associated labels:

# In[13]:

def featurizer(reader=sick_train_reader, feature_function=word_overlap_features):
    """Map the data in reader to a list of features according to feature_function,
    and create the gold label vector."""
    feats = []
    labels = []
    split_index = None
    for label, t1, t2 in reader():
        d = feature_function(t1, t2)
        feats.append(d)
        labels.append(label)              
    return (feats, labels)


# The main work of training a model is done by the following
# `train_classifier` method. At a high-level, this function is doing a
# few things, with the goal of finding the right model (in the class
# of models we're exploring) for the data we have to train on. The
# major steps:
# 
# 0. Use scikit-learn to turn the feature dictionaries into a big sparse matrix.
# 0. Optionally use a bit of statistical testing to select features that seem discriminating. 
# 0. Use cross-validation within the training data to try to find the right regularization scheme.
# 0. Train using the best-looking regularization scheme found in the previous step.
# 0. Report cross-valided F1 scores to provide a sense for how we're doing.
# 0. Return the fitted model plus the objects we need to align with future evaluation data.
# 
# Part of the thinking behind this approach is that one can work as follows:
# 
# * By and large, you check models just by training them and seeing
#   how they do in cross-validation.
# * Only ccasionally, and only with good reason, do you check how
#   you're doing on the dev set. If this is done only rarely, then it
#   will help prevent you from over-fitting to quirks of this data or
#   the training data.
# * At the very end, one runs the test. 
# * The final paper can report, for the final model,
#   * Mean cross-validation values on the training data with standard errors
#   * Dev set performance
#   * Test set performance

    ##### ASSESSMENT

# ### A few ideas for better classifier features

# * Cross product of synsets compatible with each word, as given by
# WordNet. (Here is [a codebook on using WordNet from NLTK to do
# things like
# this](http://compprag.christopherpotts.net/wordnet.html).)
# 
# * More fine-grained WordNet features &mdash; e.g., spotting pairs
# like _puppy_/_dog_ across the two sentences.
# 
# * Use of other WordNet relations (see Table 1 and Table 2 in [the
# above codelab](http://compprag.christopherpotts.net/wordnet.html)
# for relations and their coverage).
# 
# * Using the tree structure to define features that are sensitive to
# how negation scopes over constituents.
# 
# * Features that are sensitive to differences in negation between the
# two sentences.
# 
# * Sentiment features seeking to identify contrasting polarity.

# ## Shallow neural network approach

# ### Baseline distributed features

# The baseline I define here just turns each sentence into the average
# of all its word vectors. To create inputs to the network, we just
# concatenate the output of `glove_featurizer` for the two trees being
# compared. Pretty simplistic, but it is at least a start!

# In[19]:

GLOVE_MAT, GLOVE_VOCAB, _ = build('distributedwordreps-data/glove.6B.50d.txt', delimiter=' ', header=False, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)


# In[20]:

def glvvec(w):
    """Return the GloVe vector for w."""
    i = GLOVE_VOCAB.index(w)
    return GLOVE_MAT[i]

def glove_features(t):
    """Return the mean glove vector of the leaves in tree t."""
    return np.mean([glvvec(w) for w in leaves(t) if w in GLOVE_VOCAB], axis=0)

def vec_concatenate(u, v):
    return np.concatenate((u, v)) 

def glove_featurizer(t1, t2):
    """Combined input vector based on glove_features and concatenation."""
    return vec_concatenate(glove_features(t1), glove_features(t2))


# ### Output label vectors

# To shoehorn the current problem into our current neural network
# implementation, I define our output vectors as having a 1 for the
# dimension of the correct class, and a -1 for the other two classes:

# In[21]:

def labelvec(label):
    """Return output vectors like [1,-1,-1], where the unique 1 is the true label."""
    vec = np.repeat(-1.0, 3)
    vec[LABELS.index(label)] = 1.0
    return vec


# ### Network training and assessment

# To train the network, we first create the training data by pairing
# our sentence-pair vectors with the output vector:

# In[22]:

def data_prep(reader=sick_train_reader, featurizer=glove_featurizer):    
    dataset = []
    for label, t1, t2 in reader():     
        dataset.append([featurizer(t1, t2), labelvec(label)])
    return dataset


# Training is then straightforward: it just uses
# `ShallowNeuralNetwork`:

# In[23]:

def train_network(
        hidden_dim=100, 
        maxiter=1000, 
        reader=sick_train_reader,
        featurizer=glove_featurizer,
        display_progress=False):  
    dataset = data_prep(reader=reader, featurizer=featurizer)
    net = ShallowNeuralNetwork(input_dim=len(dataset[0][0]), hidden_dim=hidden_dim, output_dim=len(LABELS))
    net.train(dataset, maxiter=maxiter, display_progress=display_progress)
    return (net, featurizer)


# The evaluation function evaluates the output of `train_network`
# using a new data reader. The `featurizer` is return by
# `train_network` to ensure that it is used consistently in training
# and evalution.

# In[24]:

def evaluate_trained_network(network=None, reader=sick_dev_reader):
    """Evaluate network, the output of train_network, on the data in reader"""
    net, featurizer = network
    dataset = data_prep(reader=reader, featurizer=featurizer)
    predictions = []
    cats = []
    for ex, cat in dataset:            
        # The raw prediction is a triple of real numbers:
        prediction = net.predict(ex)
        # Argmax dimension for the prediction; this could be done better with
        # an explicit softmax objective:
        prediction = LABELS[np.argmax(prediction)]
        predictions.append(prediction)
        # Store the gold label for the classification report:
        cats.append(LABELS[np.argmax(cat)])        
    # Report:
    return metrics.classification_report(cats, predictions, target_names=LABELS)


# Here's a summary train/dev evaluation. The network has trouble
# dealing with the class imbalances, but it seems to be doing okay
# overall.

# In[25]:

if __name__ == '__main__': # Prevent this example from loading on import of this module.

    network = train_network(hidden_dim=10, maxiter=1000, reader=sick_train_reader, featurizer=glove_featurizer)
    
    for readername, reader in (('Train', sick_train_reader), ('Dev', sick_dev_reader)):
        print "======================================================================"
        print readername
        print evaluate_trained_network(network=network, reader=reader)


# ### Potential next steps

# * If you wrote improved neural net optimization code for HW1, then
# it will pay to use that instead of the basic network given in
# `distributedwordreps.py`.
# 
# * Consider using a softmax objective for the final layer of the
# network, and another (tanh, rectified linear, etc.) for the hidden
# layers.
# 
# * In the word-entailment in-class bake-off, the winning teams used
# vector difference instead of vector concatenation for the inputs.
# It's worth trying this, though the output classes are different
# here, so a variant might be called for.
# 
# * And of course it would be worth paying attention to the syntactic
# structuring by defining a recursive neural network. See Bowman et
# al. 2014 for an appropriate architecture.

# ## Homework 4

# All four problems are required. The work is due by the start of
# class on May 20.
# 
# __Important__: These questions ask you to conduct evaluations. Great
# perfomance is always nice, but you should not spend hours or days
# trying to achieve it just for the sake of this assignment. (If
# you're obsessed, then go for it, but not on account of our grading!)

# ### Problem 1
# 
# This problem calls for two revisions to `train_classifier`:
# 
# * `train_classifier` currently optimizes our multi-class problem
# using a 'one vs. rest' scheme (`multi_class=ovr`). Revise
# `train_classifier` so that the choice of value for `multi_class` is
# part of the hyper-parameter search. Be sure to look over the
# documentation for `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` &mdash;
# this kind of search requires another adjustment to how the model is
# set up. (Don't worry about overlooking something; it won't work
# unless you figure it out!)
# 
# * `train_classifier` currently does feature selection outside of the
# context of the model we ultimately want to fit. Revise the function
# so that the user has the option of using [Feature ranking with
# recursive feature elimination as implemented by scikit-learn's `RFE`
# function](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html#sklearn.feature_selection.RFE).
# This is a model-based approach to feature selection that is slow but
# can be powerful. (It's tricky to decide whether to run RFE before or
# after grid-search for the optimal parameters. I suggest before,
# since the proper regularization scheme will be heavily influenced by
# the number of features.)
# 
# __Submit__:
# 
# 1. Your revised `train_classifier` function.
#
# 2. A copy-and-paste of all the messages printed by your revised
# `train_classifier` when it is trained on `sick_train_reader` using
# `word_overlap_features` and `RFE` (`n_features_to_select=None,
# step=1, verbose=0`), with a grid-search that includes at least both
# values of `multi_class`.

# ### Problem 2
# 
# [Python NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) has an excellent WordNet
# interface. (If you don't have NLTK installed, install it now!) As
# noted above, WordNet is a natural choice for defining useful
# features in the context of NLI.
# 
# __Your task__: write a feature function, for use with
# `train_classifier`, that is just like `word_cross_product_features`
# except that, given a sentence pair $(S_{1}, S_{2})$, it counts only
# pairs $(w_{1}, w_{2})$ such that $w_{1}$ entails $w_{2}$, for $w_{1}
# \in S_{1}$ and $w_{2} \in S_{2}$. For example, the sentence pair
# (_the cat runs_, _the animal moves_) would create the dictionary
# `{(cat, animal): 1.0, (runs, moves): 1.0}`.
# 
# There are many ways to do this. For the purposes of the question, we
# can limit attention to the WordNet hypernym relation. The following
# illustrates reasonable ways to go from a string $s$ to the set of

# ### Problem 3

# By and large, deleting subphrases from a phrase will make it more
# general. For instance, if we begin with _fat cat_ and remove _cat_,
# then we end up with something that is entailed by the original. This
# also holds at the phrasal level. For example,
# 
# 
# _( land ( in ( a field ) ) )_ 
# 
# entails 
# 
# _( land )_
# 
# __Your tasks__: 
# 
# * Write a function that, given a tree (as given by `str2tree`
# above), returns a list of all of the subphrases of that tree. For
# example, given `( land ( in ( a field ) ) )` the return value should
# be the following (order irrelevant):
# 
#   `
#   [( land ( in ( a field ) ) ), ( in ( a field ) ), ( a field ), land, in, a, field]
#   `
# 
# 
# * Use this function to write a feature function that, given two
# tree-structured inputs $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, returns the number of
# cases where a phrase in $S_{2}$ contains a phrase in $S_{1}$
# (including the case where the two phrases are identical).
# 
# __Submit__: 
# 
# 1. The two functions you wrote for the above tasks.
# 
# 2. Copy-and-paste of the printed output of
# `evaluate_trained_classifier`, using your feature function, trained
# on `sick_train_reader`, with your preferred settings, and evaluated
# on `sick_dev_reader`.

# ### Problem 4
# 
# Write a new function, comparable to `glove_featurizer`, that employs
# an alternative to `vec_concatenate` and an alternative to
# `glove_features`. Train a network with this function using
# `train_network` and evaluate it using `evaluate_trained_network`,
# with the default parameters &mdash; except of course for
# `featurizer`, which should be your new function.
# 
# __Submit__:
# 
# 1. Your new function.
# 
# 2. Copy-and-paste of the report given by `evaluate_trained_network`
# from your training and evaluation run.
