THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
And in his company that gentleman
And we shall make full satisfaction
I know it by their pale and deadly looks
And teach your ears to list me with more heed
For these deep shames and great indignities
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
Here comes the almanac of my true date
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound
For forty ducats is too much to lose
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
Or I will beat this method in your sconce
For urging it the second time to me
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad
I shall beg with it from door to door
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
To know the reason of this strange restraint
This is some priory
That since have felt the vigour of his rage
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
Perchance you will not bear them patiently
For locking me out of my doors by day
My soul should sue as advocate for thee
Of vile confederates
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry
Where I will walk till thou return to me
There will we dine
I to this fortune that you see me in
Straight after did I meet him with a chain
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband
And Dromio my man did bring them me
Give me thy hand
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone
As all the metal in your shop will answer
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts
Did call me brother
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
And by the doom of death end woes and all
This is the fairy land
I am not partial to infringe our laws
Either send the chain or send by me some token
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
I sent him from the mart
And this is false you burden me withal
And every one doth call me by my name
Or else you may return without your money
And so of these
Doth for a wife abhor
My present business calls me from you now
Why at this time the doors are made against you
And gain a husband by his liberty
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps
I went to seek him
And afterward consort you till bed time
And soon and safe arrived where I was
Get thee away
Or lose my labour in assaying it
Even in the strength and height of injury
And strike you home without a messenger
And will not lightly trust the messenger
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams
They can be meek that have no other cause
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart
For with long travel I am stiff and weary
On purpose shut the doors against his way
That here and there his fury had committed
A sunny look of his would soon repair
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose
My master stays in the street
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
And so tell your master
While she with harlots feasted in my house
There is your money that I had to keep
Lightens my humour with his merry jests
Behind the ditches of the abbey here
I think you are all mated or stark mad
Or I attach you by this officer
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this
Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word
I long that we were safe and sound aboard
I am thy prisoner
Have written strange defeatures in my face
To go in person with me to my house
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight
My woes end likewise with the evening sun
And therefore homeward did they bend their course
And here we wander in illusions
To walk where any honest men resort
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here
May answer my good will and your good welcome here
It seems he hath great care to please his wife
But to procrastinate his lifeless end
He did arrest me with an officer
Else would he never so demean himself
A living dead man
For she will score your fault upon my pate
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven
Which he forswore most monstrously to have
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
In this the madman justly chargeth them
And therewithal took measure of my body
And told thee to what purpose and what end
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote
Makes me with thy strength to communicate
That would behold in me this shameful sport
Wants wit in all one word to understand
To her will we to dinner
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
My mistress and her sister stays for you
If he should scorn me so apparently
We came aboard
Then let your will attend on their accords
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold
To separate the husband and the wife
And that I did deny my wife and house
And therefore let me have him home with me
Poland winter
That he is borne about invisible
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
I greatly fear my money is not safe
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
And bring thy master home immediately
To make of him a formal man again
Commends me to the thing I cannot get
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish
To seek thy help by beneficial hap
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons
And then receive my money for the chain
And pay the sum that may deliver me
And make a common of my serious hours
Which accidentally are met together
I crave your pardon
He gains by death that hath such means to die
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other
And thereof comes it that his head is light
Consider how it stands upon my credit
Gather the sequel by that went before
I will determine this before I stir
But not a thousand marks between you both
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess
Could all my travels warrant me they live
Beheaded publicly for his offence
We came again to bind them
And wander up and down to view the city
My ring away
Or that or any place that harbours men
So fly I from her that would be my wife
Home to my house
And I will please you what you will demand
Denies that saying
If this be not a dream I see and hear
And in this mist at all adventures go
Come not near her
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think
Between you I shall have a holy head
I shall receive the money for the same
Than I stand debted to this gentleman
I long to know the truth hereof at large
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me
To do him all the grace and good I could
Of my defeatures
Both one and other he denies me now
His word might bear my wealth at any time
And me they left with those of Epidamnum
And that is false thou dost report to us
Yet will I favour thee in what I can
For lately we were bound as you are now
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Being strumpeted by thy contagion
And bear him home for his recovery
But I should know her as well as she knows me
Between them they will kill the conjurer
Perchance I will be there as soon as you
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
Thus he unknown to me should be in debt
These people saw the chain about his neck
To quit the penalty and to ransom him
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus
Where Balthazar and I did dine together
