VALENTINE
0
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
PROTEUS
0
Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
VALENTINE
0
And on a love-book pray for my success?
PROTEUS
0
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
VALENTINE
0
That's on some shallow story of deep love:
PROTEUS
0
That's a deep story of a deeper love;
VALENTINE
0
'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
PROTEUS
0
Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
VALENTINE
0
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
PROTEUS
0
What?
VALENTINE
0
To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
PROTEUS
0
So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
VALENTINE
0
So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
PROTEUS
0
'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
VALENTINE
0
Love is your master, for he masters you;
PROTEUS
0
Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
VALENTINE
0
And writers say, as the most forward bud
PROTEUS
0
And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
VALENTINE
0
Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
PROTEUS
0
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
VALENTINE
0
As much to you at home; and so farewell!
PROTEUS
0
He after honour hunts, I after love;
SPEED
0
Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
PROTEUS
0
But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
SPEED
0
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
PROTEUS
0
Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
SPEED
0
You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
PROTEUS
0
I do.
SPEED
0
Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
PROTEUS
0
A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
SPEED
0
This proves me still a sheep.
PROTEUS
0
True; and thy master a shepherd.
SPEED
0
Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
PROTEUS
0
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
SPEED
0
The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
PROTEUS
0
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
SPEED
0
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
PROTEUS
0
But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
SPEED
0
Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
PROTEUS
0
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
SPEED
0
If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
PROTEUS
0
Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
SPEED
0
Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
PROTEUS
0
You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
SPEED
0
From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
PROTEUS
0
But what said she?
SPEED
0
 [Nodding]  Ay.
PROTEUS
0
Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
SPEED
0
You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
PROTEUS
0
And that set together is 'noddy.'
SPEED
0
Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
PROTEUS
0
No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
SPEED
0
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
PROTEUS
0
Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
SPEED
0
Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
PROTEUS
0
Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
SPEED
0
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
PROTEUS
0
Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
SPEED
0
Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
PROTEUS
0
Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
SPEED
0
Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
PROTEUS
0
Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
SPEED
0
Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
PROTEUS
0
What said she? Nothing?
SPEED
0
No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify
PROTEUS
0
Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
JULIA
0
But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
LUCETTA
0
Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
JULIA
0
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
LUCETTA
0
Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
JULIA
0
What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
LUCETTA
0
As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
JULIA
0
What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
LUCETTA
0
Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
JULIA
0
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
LUCETTA
0
Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
JULIA
0
How now! what means this passion at his name?
LUCETTA
0
Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
JULIA
0
Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
LUCETTA
0
Then thus: of many good I think him best.
JULIA
0
Your reason?
LUCETTA
0
I have no other but a woman's reason:
JULIA
0
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
LUCETTA
0
Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
JULIA
0
Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
LUCETTA
0
Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
JULIA
0
His little speaking shows his love but small.
LUCETTA
0
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
JULIA
0
They do not love that do not show their love.
LUCETTA
0
O, they love least that let men know their love.
JULIA
0
I would I knew his mind.
LUCETTA
0
Peruse this paper, madam.
JULIA
0
'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
LUCETTA
0
That the contents will show.
JULIA
0
Say, say, who gave it thee?
LUCETTA
0
Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
JULIA
0
Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
LUCETTA
0
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
JULIA
0
Will ye be gone?
LUCETTA
0
That you may ruminate.                           Exit
JULIA
0
And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
What would your ladyship?
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Is't near dinner time?
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
I would it were,
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
What is't that you took up so gingerly?
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Nothing.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Why didst thou stoop then?
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
To take a paper up that I let fall.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
And is that paper nothing?
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Nothing concerning me.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
As little by such toys as may be possible.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
And why not you?
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
I cannot reach so high.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
You do not!
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
You, minion, are too saucy.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Nay, now you are too flat
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Madam,
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Well, let us go.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
If you respect them, best to take them up.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
I see you have a month's mind to them.
LUCETTA
1
LUCETTA
Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
JULIA
1
LUCETTA
Come, come; will't please you go?                Exeunt
ANTONIO
0
Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
PANTHINO
0
'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
ANTONIO
0
Why, what of him?
PANTHINO
0
He wond'red that your lordship
ANTONIO
0
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
PANTHINO
0
I think your lordship is not ignorant
ANTONIO
0
I know it well.
PANTHINO
0
'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
ANTONIO
0
I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis'd;
PANTHINO
0
To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso
ANTONIO
0
Good company; with them shall Proteus go.
PROTEUS
0
Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
ANTONIO
0
How now! What letter are you reading there?
PROTEUS
0
May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
ANTONIO
0
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
PROTEUS
0
There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
ANTONIO
0
And how stand you affected to his wish?
PROTEUS
0
As one relying on your lordship's will,
ANTONIO
0
My will is something sorted with his wish.
PROTEUS
0
My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
ANTONIO
0
Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
PROTEUS
0
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
PROTEUS
1
PANTHINO
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!
PANTHINO
1
PANTHINO
Sir Proteus, your father calls for you;
PROTEUS
1
PANTHINO
Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto;
SPEED
0
Sir, your glove.
VALENTINE
0
Not mine: my gloves are on.
SPEED
0
Why, then, this may be yours; for this is but one.
VALENTINE
0
Ha! let me see; ay, give it me, it's mine;
SPEED
0
 [Calling]  Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
VALENTINE
0
How now, sirrah?
SPEED
0
She is not within hearing, sir.
VALENTINE
0
Why, sir, who bade you call her?
SPEED
0
Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
VALENTINE
0
Well, you'll still be too forward.
SPEED
0
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
VALENTINE
0
Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
SPEED
0
She that your worship loves?
VALENTINE
0
Why, how know you that I am in love?
SPEED
0
Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like
VALENTINE
0
Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
SPEED
0
They are all perceiv'd without ye.
VALENTINE
0
Without me? They cannot.
SPEED
0
Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
VALENTINE
0
But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
SPEED
0
She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
VALENTINE
0
Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
SPEED
0
Why, sir, I know her not.
VALENTINE
0
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
SPEED
0
Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
VALENTINE
0
Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
SPEED
0
Sir, I know that well enough.
VALENTINE
0
What dost thou know?
SPEED
0
That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
VALENTINE
0
I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour
SPEED
0
That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
VALENTINE
0
How painted? and how out of count?
SPEED
0
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
VALENTINE
0
How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
SPEED
0
You never saw her since she was deform'd.
VALENTINE
0
How long hath she been deform'd?
SPEED
0
Ever since you lov'd her.
VALENTINE
0
I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
SPEED
0
If you love her, you cannot see her.
VALENTINE
0
Why?
SPEED
0
Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
VALENTINE
0
What should I see then?
SPEED
0
Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,
VALENTINE
0
Belike, boy, then you are in love; for last morning you
SPEED
0
True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you
VALENTINE
0
In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
SPEED
0
I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
VALENTINE
0
Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one
SPEED
0
And have you?
VALENTINE
0
I have.
SPEED
0
Are they not lamely writ?
VALENTINE
0
No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
SPEED
0
 [Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
VALENTINE
0
Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.
SPEED
0
 [Aside]  O, give ye good ev'n!
SILVIA
0
Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
SPEED
0
 [Aside]  He should give her interest, and she gives it him.
VALENTINE
0
As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
SILVIA
0
I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
VALENTINE
0
Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
SILVIA
0
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
VALENTINE
0
No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
SILVIA
0
A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
SPEED
0
 [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.'
VALENTINE
0
What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
SILVIA
0
Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
VALENTINE
0
Madam, they are for you.
SILVIA
0
Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
VALENTINE
0
Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
SILVIA
0
And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
VALENTINE
0
If it please me, madam, what then?
SILVIA
0
Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
SPEED
0
O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
VALENTINE
0
How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
SPEED
0
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
VALENTINE
0
To do what?
SPEED
0
To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
VALENTINE
0
To whom?
SPEED
0
To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
VALENTINE
0
What figure?
SPEED
0
By a letter, I should say.
VALENTINE
0
Why, she hath not writ to me.
SPEED
0
What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
VALENTINE
0
No, believe me.
SPEED
0
No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
VALENTINE
0
She gave me none except an angry word.
SPEED
0
Why, she hath given you a letter.
VALENTINE
0
That's the letter I writ to her friend.
SPEED
0
And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
VALENTINE
0
I would it were no worse.
SPEED
0
I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
VALENTINE
0
I have din'd.
SPEED
0
Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can feed on
PROTEUS
0
Have patience, gentle Julia.
JULIA
0
I must, where is no remedy.
PROTEUS
0
When possibly I can, I will return.
JULIA
0
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
PROTEUS
0
Why, then, we'll make exchange. Here, take you this.
JULIA
0
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
PROTEUS
0
Here is my hand for my true constancy;
PANTHINO
0
Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
PROTEUS
0
Go; I come, I come.
LAUNCE
0
Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
PANTHINO
0
Launce, away, away, aboard! Thy master is shipp'd, and
LAUNCE
0
It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
PANTHINO
0
What's the unkindest tide?
LAUNCE
0
Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
PANTHINO
0
Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in losing
LAUNCE
0
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
PANTHINO
0
Where should I lose my tongue?
LAUNCE
0
In thy tale.
PANTHINO
0
In thy tail!
LAUNCE
0
Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the
PANTHINO
0
Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
LAUNCE
0
Sir, call me what thou dar'st.
PANTHINO
0
Will thou go?
LAUNCE
0
Well, I will go.                                Exeunt
SILVIA
0
Servant!
VALENTINE
0
Mistress?
SPEED
0
Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
VALENTINE
0
Ay, boy, it's for love.
SPEED
0
Not of you.
VALENTINE
0
Of my mistress, then.
SPEED
0
'Twere good you knock'd him.                       Exit
SILVIA
0
Servant, you are sad.
VALENTINE
0
Indeed, madam, I seem so.
THURIO
0
Seem you that you are not?
VALENTINE
0
Haply I do.
THURIO
0
So do counterfeits.
VALENTINE
0
So do you.
THURIO
0
What seem I that I am not?
VALENTINE
0
Wise.
THURIO
0
What instance of the contrary?
VALENTINE
0
Your folly.
THURIO
0
And how quote you my folly?
VALENTINE
0
I quote it in your jerkin.
THURIO
0
My jerkin is a doublet.
VALENTINE
0
Well, then, I'll double your folly.
THURIO
0
How?
SILVIA
0
What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
VALENTINE
0
Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
THURIO
0
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your
VALENTINE
0
You have said, sir.
THURIO
0
Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
VALENTINE
0
I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
SILVIA
0
A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
VALENTINE
0
'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
SILVIA
0
Who is that, servant?
VALENTINE
0
Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio
THURIO
0
Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your
VALENTINE
0
I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
SILVIA
0
No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father.
DUKE
0
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
VALENTINE
0
My lord, I will be thankful
DUKE
0
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
VALENTINE
0
Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
DUKE
0
Hath he not a son?
VALENTINE
0
Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
DUKE
0
You know him well?
VALENTINE
0
I knew him as myself; for from our infancy
DUKE
0
Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
VALENTINE
0
Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
DUKE
0
Welcome him, then, according to his worth-
VALENTINE
0
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
SILVIA
0
Belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
VALENTINE
0
Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
SILVIA
0
Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
VALENTINE
0
Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
THURIO
0
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
VALENTINE
0
To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
SILVIA
0
Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
VALENTINE
0
Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you
SILVIA
0
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
VALENTINE
0
Mistress, it is; sweet lady, entertain him
SILVIA
0
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
PROTEUS
0
Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
VALENTINE
0
Leave off discourse of disability;
PROTEUS
0
My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
SILVIA
0
And duty never yet did want his meed.
PROTEUS
0
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
SILVIA
0
That you are welcome?
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
That you are worthless.
THURIO
1
THURIO
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
SILVIA
1
THURIO
I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
PROTEUS
1

We'll both attend upon your ladyship.

THURIO
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
And how do yours?
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
I left them all in health.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
My tales of love were wont to weary you;
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
No; but she is an earthly paragon.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Call her divine.
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
I will not flatter her.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Except my mistress.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Sweet, except not any;
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
And I will help thee to prefer her too:
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Then let her alone.
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
But she loves you?
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
VALENTINE
1
THURIO
Will you make haste?
PROTEUS
1
THURIO
I will.                                Exit VALENTINE
SPEED
0
Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Padua.
LAUNCE
0
Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I
SPEED
0
Come on, you madcap; I'll to the alehouse with you
LAUNCE
0
Marry, after they clos'd in earnest, they parted very
SPEED
0
But shall she marry him?
LAUNCE
0
No.
SPEED
0
How then? Shall he marry her?
LAUNCE
0
No, neither.
SPEED
0
What, are they broken?
LAUNCE
0
No, they are both as whole as a fish.
SPEED
0
Why then, how stands the matter with them?
LAUNCE
0
Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well
SPEED
0
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
LAUNCE
0
What a block art thou that thou canst not! My staff
SPEED
0
What thou say'st?
LAUNCE
0
Ay, and what I do too; look thee, I'll but lean, and my
SPEED
0
It stands under thee, indeed.
LAUNCE
0
Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
SPEED
0
But tell me true, will't be a match?
LAUNCE
0
Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will;
SPEED
0
The conclusion is, then, that it will.
LAUNCE
0
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a

0
'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how say'st thou
LAUNCE
0
I never knew him otherwise.
SPEED
0
Than how?
LAUNCE
0
A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
SPEED
0
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
LAUNCE
0
Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.
SPEED
0
I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.
LAUNCE
0
Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.
SPEED
0
Why?
LAUNCE
0
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to
SPEED

At thy service.                                  Exeunt
PROTEUS
0
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
JULIA
0
Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
LUCETTA
0
Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
JULIA
0
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
LUCETTA
0
Better forbear till Proteus make return.
JULIA
0
O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
LUCETTA
0
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
JULIA
0
The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.
LUCETTA
0
But in what habit will you go along?
JULIA
0
Not like a woman, for I would prevent
LUCETTA
0
Why then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
JULIA
0
No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
LUCETTA
0
What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
JULIA
0
That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
LUCETTA
0
You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
JULIA
0
Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favour'd.
LUCETTA
0
A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
JULIA
0
Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have
LUCETTA
0
If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
JULIA
0
Nay, that I will not.
LUCETTA
0
Then never dream on infamy, but go.
JULIA
0
That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
LUCETTA
0
All these are servants to deceitful men.
JULIA
0
Base men that use them to so base effect!
LUCETTA
0
Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him.
JULIA
0
Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong
DUKE
0
Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
PROTEUS
0
My gracious lord, that which I would discover
DUKE
0
Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
PROTEUS
0
Know, noble lord, they have devis'd a mean
DUKE
0
Upon mine honour, he shall never know
PROTEUS
0
Adieu, my lord; Sir Valentine is coming.         Exit
DUKE
0
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
VALENTINE
0
Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
DUKE
0
Be they of much import?
VALENTINE
0
The tenour of them doth but signify
DUKE
0
Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
VALENTINE
0
I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match
DUKE
0
No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
VALENTINE
0
What would your Grace have me to do in this?
DUKE
0
There is a lady, in Verona here,
VALENTINE
0
Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
DUKE
0
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
VALENTINE
0
A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
DUKE
0
But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
VALENTINE
0
Why then I would resort to her by night.
DUKE
0
Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
VALENTINE
0
What lets but one may enter at her window?
DUKE
0
Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
VALENTINE
0
Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
DUKE
0
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
VALENTINE
0
When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.
DUKE
0
This very night; for Love is like a child,
VALENTINE
0
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
DUKE
0
But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
VALENTINE
0
It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
DUKE
0
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
VALENTINE
0
Ay, my good lord.
DUKE
0
Then let me see thy cloak.
VALENTINE
0
Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
DUKE
0
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
VALENTINE
0
And why not death rather than living torment?
PROTEUS
0
Run, boy, run, run, seek him out.
LAUNCE
0
So-ho, so-ho!
PROTEUS
0
What seest thou?
LAUNCE
0
Him we go to find: there's not a hair on 's head but 'tis a
PROTEUS
0
Valentine?
VALENTINE
0
No.
PROTEUS
0
Who then? his spirit?
VALENTINE
0
Neither.
PROTEUS
0
What then?
VALENTINE
0
Nothing.
LAUNCE
0
Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
PROTEUS
0
Who wouldst thou strike?
LAUNCE
0
Nothing.
PROTEUS
0
Villain, forbear.
LAUNCE
0
Why, sir, I'll strike nothing. I pray you-
PROTEUS
0
Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
VALENTINE
0
My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
PROTEUS
0
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
VALENTINE
0
Is Silvia dead?
PROTEUS
0
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE
0
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
PROTEUS
0
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE
0
No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
LAUNCE
0
Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
PROTEUS
0
That thou art banished- O, that's the news!-
VALENTINE
0
O, I have fed upon this woe already,
PROTEUS
0
Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom-
VALENTINE
0
No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
PROTEUS
0
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
VALENTINE
0
I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
PROTEUS
0
Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
VALENTINE
0
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
LAUNCE
0
I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think
SPEED
0
How now, Signior Launce! What news with your mastership?
LAUNCE
0
With my master's ship? Why, it is at sea.
SPEED
0
Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news,
LAUNCE
0
The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
SPEED
0
Why, man? how black?
LAUNCE
0
Why, as black as ink.
SPEED
0
Let me read them.
LAUNCE
0
Fie on thee, jolt-head; thou canst not read.
SPEED
0
Thou liest; I can.
LAUNCE
0
I will try thee. Tell me this: Who begot thee?
SPEED
0
Marry, the son of my grandfather.
LAUNCE
0
O illiterate loiterer. It was the son of thy grandmother.
SPEED
0
Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
LAUNCE
0
 [Handing over the paper]  There; and Saint Nicholas be thy
SPEED
0
 [Reads]  'Inprimis: She can milk.'
LAUNCE
0
Ay, that she can.
SPEED
0
'Item: She brews good ale.'
LAUNCE
0
And thereof comes the proverb: Blessing of your heart, you
SPEED
0
'Item: She can sew.'
LAUNCE
0
That's as much as to say 'Can she so?'
SPEED
0
'Item: She can knit.'
LAUNCE
0
What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can
SPEED
0
'Item: She can wash and scour.'
LAUNCE
0
A special virtue; for then she need not be wash'd and
SPEED
0
'Item: She can spin.'
LAUNCE
0
Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for
SPEED
0
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
LAUNCE
0
That's as much as to say 'bastard virtues'; that indeed
SPEED
0
'Here follow her vices.'
LAUNCE
0
Close at the heels of her virtues.
SPEED
0
'Item: She is not to be kiss'd fasting, in respect of her
LAUNCE
0
Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast.
SPEED
0
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
LAUNCE
0
That makes amends for her sour breath.
SPEED
0
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
LAUNCE
0
It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
SPEED
0
'Item: She is slow in words.'
LAUNCE
0
O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow
SPEED
0
'Item: She is proud.'
LAUNCE
0
Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot be ta'en
SPEED
0
'Item: She hath no teeth.'
LAUNCE
0
I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
SPEED
0
'Item: She is curst.'
LAUNCE
0
Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
SPEED
0
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
LAUNCE
0
If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will;
SPEED
0
'Item: She is too liberal.'
LAUNCE
0
Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she is slow
SPEED
0
'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
LAUNCE
0
Stop there; I'll have her; she was mine, and not mine,
SPEED
0
'Item: She hath more hair than wit'-
LAUNCE
0
More hair than wit. It may be; I'll prove it: the cover of
SPEED
0
'And more faults than hairs'-
LAUNCE
0
That's monstrous. O that that were out!
SPEED
0
'And more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE
0
Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I'll have
SPEED
0
What then?
LAUNCE
0
Why, then will I tell thee- that thy master stays for thee
SPEED
0
For me?
LAUNCE
0
For thee! ay, who art thou? He hath stay'd for a better man
SPEED
0
And must I go to him?
LAUNCE
0
Thou must run to him, for thou hast stay'd so long that
SPEED
0
Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love letters!
LAUNCE
0
Now will he be swing'd for reading my letter. An unmannerly
DUKE
0
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
THURIO
0
Since his exile she hath despis'd me most,
DUKE
0
This weak impress of love is as a figure
PROTEUS
0
Gone, my good lord.
DUKE
0
My daughter takes his going grievously.
PROTEUS
0
A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
DUKE
0
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
PROTEUS
0
Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
DUKE
0
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
PROTEUS
0
I do, my lord.
DUKE
0
And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
PROTEUS
0
She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
DUKE
0
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
PROTEUS
0
The best way is to slander Valentine
DUKE
0
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
PROTEUS
0
Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
DUKE
0
Then you must undertake to slander him.
PROTEUS
0
And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
DUKE
0
Where your good word cannot advantage him,
PROTEUS
0
You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
THURIO
0
Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
DUKE
0
And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
PROTEUS
0
As much as I can do I will effect.
DUKE
0
Ay,
PROTEUS
0
Say that upon the altar of her beauty
DUKE
0
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
THURIO
0
And thy advice this night I'll put in practice;
DUKE
0
About it, gentlemen!
PROTEUS
0
We'll wait upon your Grace till after supper,
DUKE
0
Even now about it! I will pardon you.             Exeunt
FIRST OUTLAW
0
Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
SECOND OUTLAW
0
If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
THIRD OUTLAW
0
Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye;
SPEED
0
Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
VALENTINE
0
My friends-
FIRST OUTLAW
0
That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Peace! we'll hear him.
THIRD OUTLAW
0
Ay, by my beard, will we; for he is a proper man.
VALENTINE
0
Then know that I have little wealth to lose;
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Whither travel you?
VALENTINE
0
To Verona.
FIRST OUTLAW
0
Whence came you?
VALENTINE
0
From Milan.
THIRD OUTLAW
0
Have you long sojourn'd there?
VALENTINE
0
Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
FIRST OUTLAW
0
What, were you banish'd thence?
VALENTINE
0
I was.
SECOND OUTLAW
0
For what offence?
VALENTINE
0
For that which now torments me to rehearse:
FIRST OUTLAW
0
Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
VALENTINE
0
I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Have you the tongues?
VALENTINE
0
My youthful travel therein made me happy,
THIRD OUTLAW
0
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
FIRST OUTLAW
0
We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
SPEED
0
Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
VALENTINE
0
Peace, villain!
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Tell us this: have you anything to take to?
VALENTINE
0
Nothing but my fortune.
THIRD OUTLAW
0
Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
SECOND OUTLAW
0
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
FIRST OUTLAW
0
And I for such-like petty crimes as these.
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
THIRD OUTLAW
0
What say'st thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?
FIRST OUTLAW
0
But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest.
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
VALENTINE
0
I take your offer, and will live with you,
THIRD OUTLAW
0
No, we detest such vile base practices.
PROTEUS
0
Already have I been false to Valentine,
THURIO
0
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
PROTEUS
0
Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love
THURIO
0
Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
PROTEUS
0
Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
THURIO
0
Who? Silvia?
PROTEUS
0
Ay, Silvia- for your sake.
THURIO
0
I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
HOST
0
Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly; I pray you,
JULIA
0
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
HOST
0
Come, we'll have you merry; I'll bring you where you shall
JULIA
0
But shall I hear him speak?
HOST
0
Ay, that you shall.                        [Music plays]
JULIA
0
That will be music.
HOST
0
Hark, hark!
JULIA
0
Is he among these?
HOST
0
Ay; but peace! let's hear 'em.
HOST
0
How now, are you sadder than you were before?
JULIA
0
You mistake; the musician likes me not.
HOST
0
Why, my pretty youth?
JULIA
0
He plays false, father.
HOST
0
How, out of tune on the strings?
JULIA
0
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
HOST
0
You have a quick ear.
JULIA
0
Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
HOST
0
I perceive you delight not in music.
JULIA
0
Not a whit, when it jars so.
HOST
0
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
JULIA
0
Ay, that change is the spite.
HOST
0
You would have them always play but one thing?
JULIA
0
I would always have one play but one thing.
HOST
0
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov'd her out of
JULIA
0
Where is Launce?
HOST
0
Gone to seek his dog, which to-morrow, by his master's
JULIA
0
Peace, stand aside; the company parts.
PROTEUS
0
Sir Thurio, fear not you; I will so plead
THURIO
0
Where meet we?
PROTEUS
0
At Saint Gregory's well.
THURIO
0
Farewell.                  Exeunt THURIO and MUSICIANS
PROTEUS
0
Madam, good ev'n to your ladyship.
SILVIA
0
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
PROTEUS
0
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
SILVIA
0
Sir Proteus, as I take it.
PROTEUS
0
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
SILVIA
0
What's your will?
PROTEUS
0
That I may compass yours.
SILVIA
0
You have your wish; my will is even this,
PROTEUS
0
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  'Twere false, if I should speak it;
SILVIA
0
Say that she be; yet Valentine, thy friend,
PROTEUS
0
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
SILVIA
0
And so suppose am I; for in his grave
PROTEUS
0
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
SILVIA
0
Go to thy lady's grave, and call hers thence;
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  He heard not that.
PROTEUS
0
Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it
SILVIA
0
I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
PROTEUS
0
As wretches have o'ernight
JULIA
0
Host, will you go?
HOST
0
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
JULIA
0
Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
HOST
0
Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.
JULIA
0
Not so; but it hath been the longest night
EGLAMOUR
0
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
SILVIA
0
Who calls?
EGLAMOUR
0
Your servant and your friend;
SILVIA
0
Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow!
EGLAMOUR
0
As many, worthy lady, to yourself!
SILVIA
0
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-
EGLAMOUR
0
Madam, I pity much your grievances;
SILVIA
0
This evening coming.
EGLAMOUR
0
Where shall I meet you?
SILVIA
0
At Friar Patrick's cell,
EGLAMOUR
0
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
SILVIA
0
Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.                 Exeunt
LAUNCE
0
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
PROTEUS
0
Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
JULIA
0
In what you please; I'll do what I can.
PROTEUS
0
I hope thou wilt.  [To LAUNCE]  How now, you whoreson
LAUNCE
0
Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
PROTEUS
0
And what says she to my little jewel?
LAUNCE
0
Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish
PROTEUS
0
But she receiv'd my dog?
LAUNCE
0
No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
PROTEUS
0
What, didst thou offer her this from me?
LAUNCE
0
Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the
PROTEUS
0
Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,
JULIA
0
It seems you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
PROTEUS
0
Not so; I think she lives.
JULIA
0
Alas!
PROTEUS
0
Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?
JULIA
0
I cannot choose
PROTEUS
0
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
JULIA
0
Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
PROTEUS
0
Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
JULIA
0
How many women would do such a message?
SILVIA
0
What would you with her, if that I be she?
JULIA
0
If you be she, I do entreat your patience
SILVIA
0
From whom?
JULIA
0
From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
SILVIA
0
O, he sends you for a picture?
JULIA
0
Ay, madam.
SILVIA
0
Ursula, bring my picture there.
JULIA
0
Madam, please you peruse this letter.
SILVIA
0
I pray thee let me look on that again.
JULIA
0
It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
SILVIA
0
There, hold!
JULIA
0
Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
SILVIA
0
The more shame for him that he sends it me;
JULIA
0
She thanks you.
SILVIA
0
What say'st thou?
JULIA
0
I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
SILVIA
0
Dost thou know her?
JULIA
0
Almost as well as I do know myself.
SILVIA
0
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
JULIA
0
I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
SILVIA
0
Is she not passing fair?
JULIA
0
She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
SILVIA
0
How tall was she?
JULIA
0
About my stature; for at Pentecost,
SILVIA
0
She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
JULIA
0
And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
EGLAMOUR
0
The sun begins to gild the western sky,
SILVIA
0
Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
EGLAMOUR
0
Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
THURIO
0
Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
PROTEUS
0
O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
THURIO
0
What, that my leg is too long?
PROTEUS
0
No; that it is too little.
THURIO
0
I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
THURIO
0
What says she to my face?
PROTEUS
0
She says it is a fair one.
THURIO
0
Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
PROTEUS
0
But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
THURIO
0
How likes she my discourse?
PROTEUS
0
Ill, when you talk of war.
THURIO
0
But well when I discourse of love and peace?
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
THURIO
0
What says she to my valour?
PROTEUS
0
O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
THURIO
0
What says she to my birth?
PROTEUS
0
That you are well deriv'd.
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
THURIO
0
Considers she my possessions?
PROTEUS
0
O, ay; and pities them.
THURIO
0
Wherefore?
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
PROTEUS
0
That they are out by lease.
JULIA
0
Here comes the Duke.
DUKE
0
How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
THURIO
0
Not I.
PROTEUS
0
Nor I.
DUKE
0
Saw you my daughter?
PROTEUS
0
Neither.
DUKE
0
Why then,
THURIO
0
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
PROTEUS
0
And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
JULIA
0
And I will follow, more to cross that love
FIRST OUTLAW
0
Come, come.
SILVIA
0
A thousand more mischances than this one
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Come, bring her away.
FIRST OUTLAW
0
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
SECOND OUTLAW
0
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
FIRST OUTLAW
0
Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave;
SILVIA
0
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!            Exeunt
VALENTINE
0
How use doth breed a habit in a man!
PROTEUS
0
Madam, this service I have done for you,
VALENTINE
0
 [Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
SILVIA
0
O miserable, unhappy that I am!
PROTEUS
0
Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
SILVIA
0
By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
JULIA
0
 [Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
SILVIA
0
Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
PROTEUS
0
What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
SILVIA
0
When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
PROTEUS
0
In love,
SILVIA
0
All men but Proteus.
PROTEUS
0
Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
SILVIA
0
O heaven!
PROTEUS
0
I'll force thee yield to my desire.
VALENTINE
0
Ruffian! let go that rude uncivil touch;
PROTEUS
0
Valentine!
VALENTINE
0
Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
PROTEUS
0
My shame and guilt confounds me.
VALENTINE
0
Then I am paid;
JULIA
0
O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]
PROTEUS
0
Look to the boy.
VALENTINE
0
Why, boy! why, wag! how now!
JULIA
0
O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam
PROTEUS
0
Where is that ring, boy?
JULIA
0
Here 'tis; this is it.
PROTEUS
0
How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
JULIA
0
O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
PROTEUS
0
But how cam'st thou by this ring?
JULIA
0
And Julia herself did give it me;
PROTEUS
0
How! Julia!
JULIA
0
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
PROTEUS
0
Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man
VALENTINE
0
Come, come, a hand from either.
PROTEUS
0
Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.
JULIA
0
And I mine.
OUTLAW
0
A prize, a prize, a prize!
VALENTINE
0
Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.
DUKE
0
Sir Valentine!
THURIO
0
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
VALENTINE
0
Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
THURIO
0
Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
DUKE
0
The more degenerate and base art thou
VALENTINE
0
I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
DUKE
0
I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.
VALENTINE
0
These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,
DUKE
0
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
VALENTINE
0
And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
DUKE
0
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
VALENTINE
0
I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.
DUKE
0
What mean you by that saying?
VALENTINE
0
Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
