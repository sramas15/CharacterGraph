  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Love is your master, for he masters you;
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And writers say, as the most forward bud
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. As much to you at home; and so farewell!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;
    He leaves his friends to dignify them more:
    I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  PROTEUS.

JULIA
LIA. But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Is't near dinner time?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I would it were,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
  JULIA.

LUCETTA
JULIA

    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

VALENTINE
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.

LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED.

EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own

  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. And have you?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I have.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Are they not lamely writ?
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
  SPEED.

SILVIA
VALENTINE
EED.  [Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
  VALENTINE.

SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.

SILVIA
VALENTINE
EED.  [Aside]  O, give ye good ev'n!

SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.

SILVIA
VALENTINE
EED.  [Aside]  He should give her interest, and she gives it him.
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
  SPEED. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
EED.  [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.'
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Madam, they are for you.
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. If it please me, madam, what then?
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
VALENTINE
LVIA. Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
  SILVIA.

VALENTINE
LVIA. Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
    And so good morrow, servant.                     Exit SILVIA

VALENTINE
EED. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I would it were no worse.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
  VALENTINE.

PROTEUS
OTEUS. Here is my hand for my true constancy;
    And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
    Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
    The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
    Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
    My father stays my coming; answer not;
    The tide is now- nay, not thy tide of tears:
    That tide will stay me longer than I should.
    Julia, farewell!                                  Exit JULIA

PANTHINO
OTEUS. Here is my hand for my true constancy;
    And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
    Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
    The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
    Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
    My father stays my coming; answer not;

    Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;

LAUNCE
UNCE. Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
  LAUNCE. 
2
LAUNCE
PANTHINO
UNCE. Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
    kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
    proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
    Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
    look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
    my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
    neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
    vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
    for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
    this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
    and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
    the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
    well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
    speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
    here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
    mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
    tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
    tears.

SILVIA
LENTINE. Ay, boy, it's for love.

  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Wise.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. What instance of the contrary?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Your folly.
  THURIO.

SILVIA
URIO. And how quote you my folly?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. I quote it in your jerkin.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. My jerkin is a doublet.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Well, then, I'll double your folly.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. How?
  SILVIA.

SILVIA
LVIA. What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
  THURIO.

SILVIA
URIO. That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your
  VALENTINE.

SILVIA
LENTINE. You have said, sir.
  THURIO.

SILVIA
URIO. Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE. 
2
DUKE
SILVIA
LENTINE. I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
    and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it
    appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.
  SILVIA.

  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;

SILVIA
PROTEUS

  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Mistress, it is; sweet lady, entertain him
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
  PROTEUS. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
OTEUS. Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Leave off discourse of disability;

PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?

PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;

THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Will you make haste?

  LUCETTA.

CETTA. But in what habit will you go along?

    To take a note of what I stand in need of

    All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,

DUKE
PROTEUS
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself,
    And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
    Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon.
    She is my essence, and I leave to be
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Already have I been false to Valentine,
    And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
    Under the colour of commending him
    I have access my own love to prefer;
    But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
    To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
    When I protest true loyalty to her,
    She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
    When to her beauty I commend my vows,
    She bids me think how I have been forsworn
    In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd;
    And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

LAUNCE
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  LAUNCE. 
2
LAUNCE
PROTEUS
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
    it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
    from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
    sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
    cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
    say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
    were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
    judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
    'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
    thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
    I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
    stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
    pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
    for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
    you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

1
SILVIA
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refus'd,
    To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO

  THURIO.

  JULIA.

  PROTEUS.

  THURIO.

  JULIA. 
1
THURIO

  THURIO.

THURIO
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO

  JULIA. 
1

  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO

  JULIA.

  JULIA.

PROTEUS
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?
                                                   [Steps aside]

  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE

OTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;
    He leaves his friends to dignify them more:
    I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
  SPEED.

EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.

EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,

1
SPEED
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
1

EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the

OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
1

OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both

1
SPEED
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED.

LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA.

  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA

LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA.

LUCETTA

PROTEUS
PANTHINO
OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

EED.  [Calling]  Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. How now, sirrah?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. She is not within hearing, sir.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, sir, who bade you call her?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Well, you'll still be too forward.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, sir, I know her not.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,

VALENTINE
EED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you

  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. I would you were set, so your affection would cease.

LVIA. I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.

VALENTINE
LVIA. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?

  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.

LENTINE. I would it were no worse.

    Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!

PANTHINO
UNCE. Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
    kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
    proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
    Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
    look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
    my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
    neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
    vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
    for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
    this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
    and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
    the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
    well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
    speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
    here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
    mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
    tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
    tears.

DUKE
PROTEUS
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself,
    And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
    Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon.
    She is my essence, and I leave to be
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

    She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;

    In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd;
    And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

  LAUNCE. 
2
LAUNCE
PROTEUS
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
    it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
    from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
    sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
    cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
    say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
    were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
    judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
    'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
    thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
    I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
    stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
    pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
    for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
    you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

PROTEUS
OTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA. 
1
PROTEUS
LIA. Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
  PROTEUS. 
1
PROTEUS
OTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
  JULIA.

LIA. How many women would do such a message?
  JULIA.

SILVIA
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refus'd,
    To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. There, hold!
  JULIA.

SILVIA
LIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me;
  JULIA.

SILVIA
LIA. She thanks you.
  SILVIA.

SILVIA
LVIA. What say'st thou?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.

URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS.

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO

  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
  THURIO.

THURIO
URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS.

THURIO
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO.

THURIO
URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA.

LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?

    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,

  JULIA.

JULIA
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Is't near dinner time?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I would it were,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Come, come; will't please you go?                Exeunt

2
PROTEUS
PANTHINO
OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

VALENTINE
LENTINE. How now, sirrah?
  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. She is not within hearing, sir.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, sir, who bade you call her?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Well, you'll still be too forward.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like

VALENTINE
EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED.

EED. Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so

VALENTINE
EED. She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, sir, I know her not.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,

VALENTINE
EED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you

VALENTINE
EED. I would you were set, so your affection would cease.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one

VALENTINE
EED. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.

LAUNCE
PANTHINO
UNCE. Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
    kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
    proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
    Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
    look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
    my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
    neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
    vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
    for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
    this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
    and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
    the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
    well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
    speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
    here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
    mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
    tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
    tears.

1
SILVIA
EED. Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Ay, boy, it's for love.
  SPEED. 
1
SILVIA
EED. Not of you.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Of my mistress, then.
  SPEED.

  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Servant, you are sad.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Indeed, madam, I seem so.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. Seem you that you are not?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Haply I do.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. So do counterfeits.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. So do you.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. What seem I that I am not?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Wise.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. What instance of the contrary?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Your folly.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. And how quote you my folly?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. I quote it in your jerkin.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. My jerkin is a doublet.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Well, then, I'll double your folly.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. How?
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. You have said, sir.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. 'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Who is that, servant?
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
  VALENTINE. 
2
DUKE
SILVIA
LENTINE. I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
    and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it
    appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.
  SILVIA. 
2
DUKE
SILVIA
LVIA. No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father.
  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
SILVIA

DUKE

  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
SILVIA
KE. Welcome him, then, according to his worth-
  DUKE. 
1
SILVIA
KE. Welcome him, then, according to his worth-
    Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
    For Valentine, I need not cite him to it.
    I will send him hither to you presently.           Exit DUKE
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
    Upon a homely object Love can wink.              Exit THURIO

2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Mistress, it is; sweet lady, entertain him
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
  PROTEUS. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
OTEUS. Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Leave off discourse of disability;
  PROTEUS. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
OTEUS. My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. And duty never yet did want his meed.
  PROTEUS.

SILVIA
PROTEUS
OTEUS. I'll die on him that says so but yourself.

SILVIA

PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. And how do yours?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. I left them all in health.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Will you make haste?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. I will.                                Exit VALENTINE

DUKE

DUKE
JULIA

DUKE
JULIA

  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE

  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Ay, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
KE. Then let me see thy cloak.
  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
KE. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
  VALENTINE. 
4
DUKE
PROTEUS
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself,
    And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
    Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon.
    She is my essence, and I leave to be
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

LAUNCE
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  LAUNCE. 
2
LAUNCE
PROTEUS
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
    it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
    from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
    sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
    cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
    say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
    were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
    judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
    'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
    thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
    I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
    stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
    pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
    for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
    you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?
  PROTEUS.

PROTEUS
OTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA.

  PROTEUS. 
1
PROTEUS
OTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
  JULIA.

LIA. How many women would do such a message?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refus'd,
    To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. There, hold!
  JULIA.

SILVIA

  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA

  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. She thanks you.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. What say'st thou?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
  SILVIA.

  JULIA.

  PROTEUS.

  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO.

URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA.

  THURIO.

  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
1

  PROTEUS.

  PROTEUS.

THURIO
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?

    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify

  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA.

LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?

2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;

  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED.

EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE.

    Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
    My father stays my coming; answer not;
    The tide is now- nay, not thy tide of tears:
    That tide will stay me longer than I should.

LAUNCE
PANTHINO
UNCE. Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
    kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
    proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
    Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
    look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
    my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
    neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
    vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
    for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
    this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
    and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
    the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
    well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
    speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
    here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
    mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
    tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
    tears.

PROTEUS
THURIO

PROTEUS
THURIO

PROTEUS
THURIO

DUKE

DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
  VALENTINE. 
4
DUKE
PROTEUS
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself,
    And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
    Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon.
    She is my essence, and I leave to be
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

    cate-log  [Pulling out a paper]  of her condition. 'Inprimis: She

    To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
    When I protest true loyalty to her,
    She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
    When to her beauty I commend my vows,
    She bids me think how I have been forsworn
    In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd;
    And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

  LAUNCE.

LAUNCE
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  LAUNCE. 
2
LAUNCE
PROTEUS
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
    it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
    from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
    sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
    cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
    say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
    were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
    judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
    'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
    thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
    I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
    stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
    pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
    for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
    you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?
  PROTEUS.

  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refus'd,
    To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
  SILVIA.

SILVIA

  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA

SILVIA
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA

  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA

    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?

PROTEUS
VALENTINE
LIA. O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam

  JULIA. 
2
PROTEUS
VALENTINE

  JULIA. 
2
PROTEUS
VALENTINE
LIA. O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
VALENTINE
OTEUS. But how cam'st thou by this ring?
  JULIA. 
2
PROTEUS
VALENTINE

PROTEUS
VALENTINE
OTEUS. How! Julia!
  JULIA.

VALENTINE

  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Love is your master, for he masters you;
  PROTEUS.

SPEED
OTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;
    He leaves his friends to dignify them more:
    I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED. 
1

  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA.

  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA.

LUCETTA
JULIA

EED. She that your worship loves?

LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED.

1
VALENTINE
EED. Why, sir, I know her not.

VALENTINE
EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?

VALENTINE
LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour

VALENTINE

1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still

1
VALENTINE
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED.

VALENTINE
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,

EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. To whom?

1
VALENTINE
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
1
VALENTINE
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE.

    kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
    proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
    Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
    look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
    my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
    neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
    vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
    for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
    this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
    and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
    the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
    well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
    speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
    here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
    mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
    tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
    tears.

JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself,
    And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
    Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon.
    She is my essence, and I leave to be
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

URIO. Since his exile she hath despis'd me most,
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. This weak impress of love is as a figure
  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. This weak impress of love is as a figure
    Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
    Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
    A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
    And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
  PROTEUS. 
2

PROTEUS
OTEUS. Gone, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
2

  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
  PROTEUS. 
2

  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
  PROTEUS. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
OTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine
  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
  PROTEUS. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
OTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it;

2

  PROTEUS.

2

  PROTEUS. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
OTEUS. You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
  THURIO. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
URIO. Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
  PROTEUS. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
OTEUS. As much as I can do I will effect.
  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. Ay,

PROTEUS
OTEUS. Say that upon the altar of her beauty
  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROTEUS
KE. This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
  THURIO. 
2

PROTEUS
URIO. And thy advice this night I'll put in practice;

    Under the colour of commending him
    I have access my own love to prefer;
    But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
    To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
    When I protest true loyalty to her,
    She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
    When to her beauty I commend my vows,
    She bids me think how I have been forsworn
    In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd;
    And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  LAUNCE. 
2
LAUNCE
PROTEUS
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
    it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
    from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
    sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
    cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
    say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
    were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
    judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
    'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
    thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
    I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
    stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
    pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
    for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
    you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

SILVIA
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refus'd,
    To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA.

1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my face?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:

THURIO
URIO. How likes she my discourse?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.

URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS.

THURIO
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO.

URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?

  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE.

VALENTINE
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
1
VALENTINE
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
1
VALENTINE
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS.

    I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
1

OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.

EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,

EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and

SPEED
OTEUS. I do.

EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.

EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.

EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS.

  PROTEUS. 
1
SPEED
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
1
SPEED
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your

1
SPEED
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.

EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,

OTEUS. But what said she?

EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS.

  JULIA. 
1
JULIA

  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA

  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA.

  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
1
JULIA
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
1
JULIA
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA.

JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA.

LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA.

JULIA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.

JULIA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA.

LUCETTA
JULIA

  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA

  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA.

LUCETTA
JULIA

LUCETTA
JULIA

LUCETTA
JULIA

LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.

LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
2
LUCETTA
JULIA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

LUCETTA
JULIA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;

    kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
    proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
    Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
    sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
    hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
    cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
    stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
    look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
    the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
    my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
    neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
    shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
    vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
    for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
    this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
    and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
    Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
    the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
    well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
    speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
    here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
    mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
    tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
    tears.

SILVIA
LVIA. Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
  THURIO. 
1
SILVIA
URIO. They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
  VALENTINE. 
1
SILVIA
LENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
    Upon a homely object Love can wink.              Exit THURIO

SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Mistress, it is; sweet lady, entertain him
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
  PROTEUS. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
OTEUS. Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
  VALENTINE. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LENTINE. Leave off discourse of disability;
  PROTEUS. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
OTEUS. My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
  SILVIA. 
2
SILVIA
PROTEUS
LVIA. And duty never yet did want his meed.

PROTEUS

PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. I left them all in health.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,
  PROTEUS. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
OTEUS. Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
  VALENTINE. 
2
PROTEUS
THURIO
LENTINE. Will you make haste?

DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA

  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Ay, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
KE. Then let me see thy cloak.
  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
KE. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  VALENTINE. 
3
DUKE
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
  VALENTINE. 
4
DUKE
PROTEUS
JULIA
VALENTINE
LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself,
    And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
    Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by,
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon.
    She is my essence, and I leave to be
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
    But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

    in love; but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor
    who 'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman I will not
    tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet 'tis not a maid, for
    she hath had gossips; yet 'tis a maid, for she is her master's
    maid and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a
    water-spaniel- which is much in a bare Christian. Here is the
    cate-log  [Pulling out a paper]  of her condition. 'Inprimis: She
    can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse

    To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
    When I protest true loyalty to her,
    She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
    When to her beauty I commend my vows,
    She bids me think how I have been forsworn
    In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd;
    And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

LAUNCE
PROTEUS
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
    it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
    from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
    sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
    precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
    as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
    sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
    and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
    cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
    say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
    were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
    take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
    hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
    judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
    there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
    him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
    another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
    Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
    was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
    'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
    quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
    thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
    the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
    I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
    stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
    pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
    for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
    you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
    thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
    up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
    Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

SILVIA
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refus'd,
    To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    But cannot be true servant to my master
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

  JULIA.

SILVIA

LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
1
SILVIA
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
1
SILVIA
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA.

SILVIA
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA.

  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA.

THURIO

  THURIO. 
1

  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
1

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:

THURIO
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
1
THURIO
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
1
THURIO
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.

URIO. Considers she my possessions?

URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA.

PROTEUS
VALENTINE
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?

CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Is't near dinner time?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I would it were,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Come, come; will't please you go?                Exeunt

TONIO. Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. 'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, what of him?
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. He wond'red that your lordship
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. I think your lordship is not ignorant
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I know it well.
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. 'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis'd;
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Good company; with them shall Proteus go.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. How now! What letter are you reading there?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And how stand you affected to his wish?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. As one relying on your lordship's will,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My will is something sorted with his wish.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. Sir Proteus, your father calls for you;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto;
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, your glove.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Not mine: my gloves are on.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, then, this may be yours; for this is but one.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ha! let me see; ay, give it me, it's mine;
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Calling]  Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How now, sirrah?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. She is not within hearing, sir.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, sir, who bade you call her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Well, you'll still be too forward.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, sir, I know her not.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour
  SPEED. 
0
EED. That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Belike, boy, then you are in love; for last morning you
  SPEED. 
0
EED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And have you?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Are they not lamely writ?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Aside]  O, give ye good ev'n!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Aside]  He should give her interest, and she gives it him.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.'
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Madam, they are for you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. If it please me, madam, what then?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I would it were no worse.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have din'd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can feed on
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Have patience, gentle Julia.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I must, where is no remedy.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. When possibly I can, I will return.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, then, we'll make exchange. Here, take you this.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Here is my hand for my true constancy;
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Go; I come, I come.

NTHINO. What's the unkindest tide?
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.

NTHINO. Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in losing
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. Where should I lose my tongue?
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. In thy tale.
  PANTHINO.

NTHINO. In thy tail!
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the

UNCE. Sir, call me what thou dar'st.

EED. Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, boy, it's for love.
  SPEED.

EED. Not of you.
  VALENTINE.

  THURIO.

URIO. Seem you that you are not?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Haply I do.
  THURIO.

URIO. So do counterfeits.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. So do you.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What seem I that I am not?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Wise.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What instance of the contrary?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Your folly.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. And how quote you my folly?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I quote it in your jerkin.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. My jerkin is a doublet.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Well, then, I'll double your folly.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. How?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. You have said, sir.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. 'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. Who is that, servant?
  VALENTINE.

LVIA. No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father.
  DUKE.

  DUKE.

LENTINE. Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
  DUKE.

LENTINE. I knew him as myself; for from our infancy
  DUKE.

KE. Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,

  DUKE.

KE. Welcome him, then, according to his worth-

LVIA. Belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Mistress, it is; sweet lady, entertain him
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Leave off discourse of disability;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
  SILVIA.

LVIA. And duty never yet did want his meed.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. That you are welcome?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That you are worthless.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And how do yours?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I left them all in health.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Will you make haste?

  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. No, neither.
  SPEED.

EED. What, are they broken?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. No, they are both as whole as a fish.
  SPEED.

EED. Why then, how stands the matter with them?
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well

UNCE. Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
  SPEED.

EED. But tell me true, will't be a match?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will;

UNCE. I never knew him otherwise.
  SPEED.

EED. Than how?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.
  SPEED.

EED. I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to

OTEUS. To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Better forbear till Proteus make return.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. But in what habit will you go along?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Not like a woman, for I would prevent
  LUCETTA.

CETTA. Why then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
  LUCETTA.

CETTA. What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
  JULIA.

LIA. That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,

CETTA. You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
  JULIA.

  LUCETTA.

CETTA. A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,

LIA. Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have

0
CETTA. If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, that I will not.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Then never dream on infamy, but go.
  JULIA.

LIA. That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
  LUCETTA.

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
  DUKE.

KE. Be they of much import?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. The tenour of them doth but signify
  DUKE.

KE. Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match
  DUKE. 
0
KE. No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What would your Grace have me to do in this?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is a lady, in Verona here,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why then I would resort to her by night.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. What lets but one may enter at her window?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. This very night; for Love is like a child,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
  DUKE. 
0
KE. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then let me see thy cloak.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  VALENTINE.

OTEUS. Villain, forbear.
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, sir, I'll strike nothing. I pray you-
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Is Silvia dead?
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. No, Valentine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. No, Valentine.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. That thou art banished- O, that's the news!-
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. O, I have fed upon this woe already,
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom-

LENTINE. No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st

UNCE. With my master's ship? Why, it is at sea.
  SPEED.

EED. Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news,
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, man? how black?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, as black as ink.
  SPEED.

EED. Let me read them.

UNCE. I will try thee. Tell me this: Who begot thee?

OTEUS. She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
  DUKE.

KE. Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
  DUKE.

  PROTEUS.

LIA.  [Aside]  He heard not that.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. As wretches have o'ernight
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Host, will you go?
  HOST. 
0
ST. By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
  HOST. 
0
ST. Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Not so; but it hath been the longest night
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. This is the hour that Madam Silvia
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Who calls?
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Your servant and your friend;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow!
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. As many, worthy lady, to yourself!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Madam, I pity much your grievances;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. This evening coming.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Where shall I meet you?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. At Friar Patrick's cell,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.                 Exeunt
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. In what you please; I'll do what I can.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And what says she to my little jewel?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But she receiv'd my dog?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What, didst thou offer her this from me?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It seems you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Not so; I think she lives.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Alas!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot choose
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What would you with her, if that I be she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. If you be she, I do entreat your patience
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. From whom?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Ay, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I pray thee let me look on that again.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. There, hold!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She thanks you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What say'st thou?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. How tall was she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. About my stature; for at Pentecost,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. The sun begins to gild the western sky,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my face?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. How likes she my discourse?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That they are out by lease.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here comes the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Not I.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nor I.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Saw you my daughter?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Neither.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Why then,
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I will follow, more to cross that love

RST OUTLAW. Where is the gentleman that was with her?

  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Madam, this service I have done for you,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE.  [Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O miserable, unhappy that I am!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. In love,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. All men but Proteus.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O heaven!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I'll force thee yield to my desire.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ruffian! let go that rude uncivil touch;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Valentine!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My shame and guilt confounds me.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Then I am paid;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Look to the boy.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, boy! why, wag! how now!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Where is that ring, boy?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here 'tis; this is it.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But how cam'st thou by this ring?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And Julia herself did give it me;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! Julia!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Come, come, a hand from either.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I mine.
  OUTLAW.

TLAW. A prize, a prize, a prize!
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Sir Valentine!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The more degenerate and base art thou
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.

0
EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
0

  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Is't near dinner time?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. I would it were,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA

LUCETTA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;

NTHINO. 'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Why, what of him?
  PANTHINO.

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two

TONIO. Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. And how stand you affected to his wish?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. As one relying on your lordship's will,
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. My will is something sorted with his wish.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,

PANTHINO
OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

LENTINE. How now, sirrah?
  SPEED.

EED. She is not within hearing, sir.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why, sir, who bade you call her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Well, you'll still be too forward.
  SPEED.

EED. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
  SPEED.

EED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like

LENTINE. Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
  SPEED.

EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED.

EED. Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
  SPEED.

EED. She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, sir, I know her not.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
  SPEED.

EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour

EED. That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all

LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,

EED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you

LENTINE. In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one

EED. And have you?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I have.
  SPEED.

LENTINE. No, boy, but as well as I can do them.

LENTINE. As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
  SILVIA.

LVIA. I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
  SILVIA.

LVIA. A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;

EED.  [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.'
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Madam, they are for you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. If it please me, madam, what then?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I would it were no worse.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I have din'd.

  JULIA.

URIO. And how quote you my folly?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I quote it in your jerkin.
  THURIO.

URIO. My jerkin is a doublet.

URIO. How?
  SILVIA.

LVIA. What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Leave off discourse of disability;
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. And how do yours?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. I left them all in health.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE.

THURIO
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE.

THURIO
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE.

THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,

  LAUNCE.

EED. Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.

CETTA. Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
  JULIA.

LIA. A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Better forbear till Proteus make return.
  JULIA.

LIA. O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. But in what habit will you go along?
  JULIA.

LIA. Not like a woman, for I would prevent

  JULIA.

LIA. No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings

CETTA. If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
  JULIA.

LIA. Nay, that I will not.
  LUCETTA.

CETTA. Then never dream on infamy, but go.
  JULIA.

LENTINE. The tenour of them doth but signify

LENTINE. I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match
  DUKE. 
0
KE. No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What would your Grace have me to do in this?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is a lady, in Verona here,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why then I would resort to her by night.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. What lets but one may enter at her window?
  DUKE.

KE. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,

LENTINE. Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
  DUKE.

KE. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.
  DUKE.

KE. This very night; for Love is like a child,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
  DUKE.

KE. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then let me see thy cloak.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
  DUKE.

OTEUS. Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,

  PROTEUS.

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.

OTEUS. No, Valentine.

EED. Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news,

0
UNCE. The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, man? how black?
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, as black as ink.
  SPEED.

OTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine
  DUKE.

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
  DUKE.

  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
  HOST. 
0
ST. Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Not so; but it hath been the longest night
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. This is the hour that Madam Silvia
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Who calls?
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Your servant and your friend;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow!
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. As many, worthy lady, to yourself!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Madam, I pity much your grievances;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. This evening coming.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Where shall I meet you?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. At Friar Patrick's cell,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.                 Exeunt
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. In what you please; I'll do what I can.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And what says she to my little jewel?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But she receiv'd my dog?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What, didst thou offer her this from me?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It seems you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Not so; I think she lives.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Alas!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot choose
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What would you with her, if that I be she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. If you be she, I do entreat your patience
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. From whom?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Ay, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I pray thee let me look on that again.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. There, hold!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She thanks you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What say'st thou?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. How tall was she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. About my stature; for at Pentecost,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. The sun begins to gild the western sky,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my face?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. How likes she my discourse?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That they are out by lease.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here comes the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Not I.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nor I.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Saw you my daughter?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Neither.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Why then,
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I will follow, more to cross that love

RST OUTLAW. Where is the gentleman that was with her?
  SECOND

COND OUTLAW. Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,

  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Madam, this service I have done for you,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE.  [Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O miserable, unhappy that I am!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. In love,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. All men but Proteus.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O heaven!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I'll force thee yield to my desire.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ruffian! let go that rude uncivil touch;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Valentine!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My shame and guilt confounds me.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Then I am paid;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Look to the boy.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, boy! why, wag! how now!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Where is that ring, boy?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here 'tis; this is it.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But how cam'st thou by this ring?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And Julia herself did give it me;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! Julia!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Come, come, a hand from either.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.
  JULIA.

LIA. And I mine.
  OUTLAW.

  VALENTINE.

  DUKE. 
0
KE. Sir Valentine!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The more degenerate and base art thou
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.

OTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.

OTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;

EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
  SPEED.

EED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify

0
CETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Is't near dinner time?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. I would it were,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
1

LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA.

LUCETTA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

LUCETTA
CETTA. Madam,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. I see you have a month's mind to them.
  LUCETTA.

LUCETTA

0
NTHINO. 'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, what of him?
  PANTHINO.

NTHINO. He wond'red that your lordship

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. And how stand you affected to his wish?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. As one relying on your lordship's will,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My will is something sorted with his wish.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
  PROTEUS.

PANTHINO
OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Ha! let me see; ay, give it me, it's mine;

EED.  [Calling]  Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!

LENTINE. How now, sirrah?
  SPEED.

EED. She is not within hearing, sir.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why, sir, who bade you call her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Well, you'll still be too forward.
  SPEED.

EED. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
  SPEED.

EED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like

LENTINE. Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
  SPEED.

EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.

LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED.

EED. Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
  VALENTINE.

EED. She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?

LENTINE. Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, sir, I know her not.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
  SPEED.

EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour

EED. That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all

LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,

EED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you

LENTINE. In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one

EED. And have you?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I have.

LENTINE. No, boy, but as well as I can do them.

LENTINE. As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
  SILVIA.

LVIA. I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
  SILVIA.

LVIA. A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;

EED.  [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.'
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Madam, they are for you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. If it please me, madam, what then?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I would it were no worse.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I have din'd.

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. I quote it in your jerkin.
  THURIO.

URIO. How?

OTEUS. Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. And how do yours?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. I left them all in health.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE.

THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,

EED. Than how?
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.

EED. I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.

LIA. Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;

CETTA. Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Better forbear till Proteus make return.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. But in what habit will you go along?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Not like a woman, for I would prevent

CETTA. Why then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
  LUCETTA.

CETTA. What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
  JULIA.

LIA. That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,

CETTA. You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
  JULIA.

  LUCETTA.

CETTA. A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,

LIA. Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have

CETTA. If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
  JULIA.

LIA. Nay, that I will not.
  LUCETTA.

CETTA. Then never dream on infamy, but go.
  JULIA.

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
  DUKE.

KE. No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. What would your Grace have me to do in this?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is a lady, in Verona here,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why then I would resort to her by night.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. What lets but one may enter at her window?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. This very night; for Love is like a child,
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
  DUKE.

KE. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then let me see thy cloak.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
  DUKE.

OTEUS. Villain, forbear.
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, sir, I'll strike nothing. I pray you-
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
  PROTEUS.

LENTINE. Is Silvia dead?
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. No, Valentine.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.

OTEUS. No, Valentine.

EED. Why, man? how black?
  LAUNCE.

OTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
  DUKE.

  PROTEUS.

LVIA. Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow!
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. As many, worthy lady, to yourself!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Madam, I pity much your grievances;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. This evening coming.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Where shall I meet you?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. At Friar Patrick's cell,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.                 Exeunt
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. In what you please; I'll do what I can.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And what says she to my little jewel?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But she receiv'd my dog?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What, didst thou offer her this from me?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It seems you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Not so; I think she lives.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Alas!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot choose
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What would you with her, if that I be she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. If you be she, I do entreat your patience
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. From whom?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Ay, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I pray thee let me look on that again.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. There, hold!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She thanks you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What say'st thou?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. How tall was she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. About my stature; for at Pentecost,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. The sun begins to gild the western sky,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my face?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. How likes she my discourse?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That they are out by lease.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here comes the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Not I.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nor I.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Saw you my daughter?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Neither.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Why then,
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I will follow, more to cross that love
  FIRST 
0
RST OUTLAW. Come, come.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. A thousand more mischances than this one
  SECOND 
0
COND OUTLAW. Come, bring her away.
  FIRST 
0
RST OUTLAW. Where is the gentleman that was with her?
  SECOND 
0
COND OUTLAW. Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
  FIRST 
0
RST OUTLAW. Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O Valentine, this I endure for thee!            Exeunt
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Madam, this service I have done for you,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE.  [Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O miserable, unhappy that I am!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. In love,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. All men but Proteus.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O heaven!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I'll force thee yield to my desire.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ruffian! let go that rude uncivil touch;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Valentine!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My shame and guilt confounds me.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Then I am paid;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Look to the boy.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, boy! why, wag! how now!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Where is that ring, boy?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here 'tis; this is it.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But how cam'st thou by this ring?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And Julia herself did give it me;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! Julia!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Come, come, a hand from either.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I mine.
  OUTLAW. 
0
TLAW. A prize, a prize, a prize!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Sir Valentine!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The more degenerate and base art thou
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.
  DUKE.

KE. What mean you by that saying?

0
OTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.

OTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;

0
EED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I do.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. This proves me still a sheep.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But what said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED.  [Nodding]  Ay.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What said she? Nothing?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Your reason?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I would I knew his mind.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That the contents will show.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Will ye be gone?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
    It were a shame to call her back again,
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. What would your ladyship?
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Is't near dinner time?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. I would it were,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nothing.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Why didst thou stoop then?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And is that paper nothing?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nothing concerning me.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. And why not you?
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. I cannot reach so high.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. You do not!
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. You, minion, are too saucy.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nay, now you are too flat
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
  JULIA.

  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter-
    Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
    And throw it thence into the raging sea.
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one upon another;
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

LUCETTA
CETTA. Madam,

LUCETTA
LIA. Well, let us go.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
  JULIA. 
1
LUCETTA
LIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.
  LUCETTA. 
1
LUCETTA
CETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
  JULIA.

LUCETTA

TONIO. Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. 'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, what of him?
  PANTHINO. 
0
NTHINO. He wond'red that your lordship

NTHINO. I think your lordship is not ignorant

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. And how stand you affected to his wish?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. As one relying on your lordship's will,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. My will is something sorted with his wish.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
  ANTONIO.

TONIO. Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
  PROTEUS. 
1
PANTHINO
OTEUS. Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by an by a cloud takes all away!

  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Ha! let me see; ay, give it me, it's mine;

EED.  [Calling]  Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. How now, sirrah?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. She is not within hearing, sir.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, sir, who bade you call her?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Well, you'll still be too forward.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
  SPEED.

EED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like

LENTINE. Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. They are all perceiv'd without ye.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Without me? They cannot.
  SPEED.

EED. Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
  SPEED.

EED. She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, sir, I know her not.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
  SPEED.

EED. Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Sir, I know that well enough.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What dost thou know?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour

0
EED. That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. How painted? and how out of count?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. You never saw her since she was deform'd.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How long hath she been deform'd?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Ever since you lov'd her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
  SPEED. 
0
EED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What should I see then?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,

EED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you

LENTINE. In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one

EED. And have you?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have.
  SPEED.

LENTINE. No, boy, but as well as I can do them.

LVIA. Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
  SPEED.

EED.  [Aside]  He should give her interest, and she gives it him.
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
  SILVIA.

LVIA. A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;

EED.  [Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another' yet.'
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Madam, they are for you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. If it please me, madam, what then?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To do what?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. To whom?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What figure?
  SPEED. 
0
EED. By a letter, I should say.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, she hath not writ to me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No, believe me.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. She gave me none except an angry word.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. Why, she hath given you a letter.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. That's the letter I writ to her friend.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I would it were no worse.
  SPEED. 
0
EED. I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I have din'd.

EED. Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can feed on

OTEUS. Have patience, gentle Julia.
  JULIA.

LIA. I must, where is no remedy.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. When possibly I can, I will return.
  JULIA.

LIA. If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Why, then, we'll make exchange. Here, take you this.
  JULIA.

LENTINE. Your folly.
  THURIO.

URIO. And how quote you my folly?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I quote it in your jerkin.
  THURIO.

URIO. My jerkin is a doublet.

URIO. How?
  SILVIA.

LVIA. What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
  VALENTINE.

OTEUS. Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. And how do yours?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. I left them all in health.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
  PROTEUS.

THURIO
OTEUS. No; but she is an earthly paragon.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Call her divine.
  PROTEUS.

THURIO
OTEUS. I will not flatter her.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
  PROTEUS.

THURIO
OTEUS. When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
  VALENTINE.

THURIO
LENTINE. Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Except my mistress.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Sweet, except not any;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. And I will help thee to prefer her too:
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. Then let her alone.
  VALENTINE. 
1
THURIO
LENTINE. Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
  PROTEUS. 
1
THURIO
OTEUS. But she loves you?
  VALENTINE.

THURIO
LENTINE. Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,

EED. Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.
  SPEED.

EED. I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.
  SPEED.

EED. Why?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to

OTEUS. To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Better forbear till Proteus make return.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. But in what habit will you go along?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Not like a woman, for I would prevent
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Why then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
  LUCETTA.

CETTA. You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
  JULIA.

LIA. Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favour'd.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, that I will not.
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. Then never dream on infamy, but go.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
  LUCETTA. 
0
CETTA. All these are servants to deceitful men.
  JULIA.

LIA. Base men that use them to so base effect!
  LUCETTA.

OTEUS. Know, noble lord, they have devis'd a mean

OTEUS. Adieu, my lord; Sir Valentine is coming.         Exit
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be they of much import?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. The tenour of them doth but signify
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match
  DUKE. 
0
KE. No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What would your Grace have me to do in this?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is a lady, in Verona here,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why then I would resort to her by night.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. What lets but one may enter at her window?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. This very night; for Love is like a child,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
  DUKE. 
0
KE. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ay, my good lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then let me see thy cloak.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
  VALENTINE.

LENTINE. And why not death rather than living torment?

LENTINE. Nothing.

  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Who wouldst thou strike?
  LAUNCE.

UNCE. Nothing.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Villain, forbear.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, sir, I'll strike nothing. I pray you-
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Is Silvia dead?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No, Valentine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No, Valentine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That thou art banished- O, that's the news!-
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. O, I have fed upon this woe already,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom-
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,

LENTINE. I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,

  LAUNCE.

UNCE. With my master's ship? Why, it is at sea.
  SPEED.

EED. Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news,
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
  SPEED.

EED. Why, man? how black?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Why, as black as ink.
  SPEED.

EED. Let me read them.

UNCE. I will try thee. Tell me this: Who begot thee?
  SPEED.

EED. Marry, the son of my grandfather.

KE. So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
  PROTEUS.

  DUKE.

OTEUS. She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
  DUKE.

KE. Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then you must undertake to slander him.
  PROTEUS.

OTEUS. And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
  DUKE.

  VALENTINE.

  VALENTINE.

LAMOUR. I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.                 Exeunt
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. In what you please; I'll do what I can.
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And what says she to my little jewel?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But she receiv'd my dog?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What, didst thou offer her this from me?
  LAUNCE. 
0
UNCE. Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It seems you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Not so; I think she lives.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Alas!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot choose
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. How many women would do such a message?
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What would you with her, if that I be she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. If you be she, I do entreat your patience
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. From whom?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Ay, madam.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. I pray thee let me look on that again.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. There, hold!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She thanks you.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. What say'st thou?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Dost thou know her?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Is she not passing fair?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. How tall was she?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. About my stature; for at Pentecost,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. The sun begins to gild the western sky,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
  EGLAMOUR. 
0
LAMOUR. Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What, that my leg is too long?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. No; that it is too little.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my face?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. She says it is a fair one.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. How likes she my discourse?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Ill, when you talk of war.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my valour?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. What says she to my birth?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That you are well deriv'd.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Considers she my possessions?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. O, ay; and pities them.
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Wherefore?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. That they are out by lease.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here comes the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Not I.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nor I.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Saw you my daughter?
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Neither.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Why then,
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I will follow, more to cross that love
  FIRST 
0
RST OUTLAW. Come, come.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. A thousand more mischances than this one
  SECOND 
0
COND OUTLAW. Come, bring her away.
  FIRST 
0
RST OUTLAW. Where is the gentleman that was with her?
  SECOND 
0
COND OUTLAW. Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
  FIRST 
0
RST OUTLAW. Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O Valentine, this I endure for thee!            Exeunt
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. How use doth breed a habit in a man!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Madam, this service I have done for you,
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE.  [Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O miserable, unhappy that I am!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA.  [Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. In love,
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. All men but Proteus.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
  SILVIA. 
0
LVIA. O heaven!
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. I'll force thee yield to my desire.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Ruffian! let go that rude uncivil touch;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Valentine!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. My shame and guilt confounds me.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Then I am paid;
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Look to the boy.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Why, boy! why, wag! how now!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Where is that ring, boy?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Here 'tis; this is it.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. But how cam'st thou by this ring?
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And Julia herself did give it me;
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. How! Julia!
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Come, come, a hand from either.
  PROTEUS. 
0
OTEUS. Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.
  JULIA. 
0
LIA. And I mine.
  OUTLAW. 
0
TLAW. A prize, a prize, a prize!
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Sir Valentine!
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
  THURIO. 
0
URIO. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The more degenerate and base art thou
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. What mean you by that saying?
  VALENTINE. 
0
LENTINE. Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
