    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
    To show her merit that did miss her love?

    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those

    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove

    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.
    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit

    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone
    He will return; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense

    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.

    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove

    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.

    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.
    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit

    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.

    When haply he shall hear that she is gone
    He will return; and hope I may that she,

    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.

    The hind that would be mated by the lion

    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.

    Those tender limbs of thine to the event

    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;

    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,

    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
    To show her merit that did miss her love?

UNTESS. What angel shall
    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone
    He will return; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
    To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     Exeunt

    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.

    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;

    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    What power is it which mounts my love so high,

    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those

    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove

    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.

    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove

    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;

    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,

    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

PAROLLES
KING

OF
LENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
    To show her merit that did miss her love?
    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,
    But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.        Exit

    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone
    He will return; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
    To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     Exeunt

    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.

    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one

    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    What power is it which mounts my love so high,

    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings

    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,

    In his bright radiance and collateral light

    The hind that would be mated by the lion

    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable

PAROLLES
LENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

PAROLLES
KING
LENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
    To show her merit that did miss her love?
    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,
    But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.        Exit

    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I

    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark

    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd

    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight

    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.

    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one

    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.

    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove

PAROLLES
LENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.

KING
LAFEU
LENA. Ay, my good lord.
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. I knew him.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. We thank you, maiden;
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;

2
KING
LAFEU

LENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Upon thy certainty and confidence
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. Tax of impudence,

2
KING
LAFEU

  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. If I break time, or flinch in property

2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Make thy demand.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. But will you make it even?
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. Not much commendation to them?
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
  COUNTESS. 
2
KING
LAFEU
UNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. And so 'tis.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Right; so I say.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. That gave him out incurable-
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU

KING
LAFEU

  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU

2
KING
LAFEU

  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU

KING
LAFEU

  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Generally thankful.
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?

  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU

KING
LAFEU
LENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,

2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;

2
KING

2
KING
LAFEU

  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Know'st thou not, Bertram,
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Yes, my good lord;
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
  KING. 
2
KING
LAFEU
NG. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
  KING. 
2
KING

    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
    And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,

KING

  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
  LAFEU. 
1
KING
FEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
  PAROLLES. 
1
KING
ROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Who? God?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Ay, sir.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. What two things?
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Why, I say nothing.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
  CLOWN. 
2
KING
LAFEU
OWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. What's his else?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. What more commands he?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. In everything I wait upon his will.
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. I shall report it so.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. You have it from his own deliverance.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES.  [To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Sir!
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a

2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM.  [Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. She is.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Will she away to-night?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. As you'll have her.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
  LAFEU. 
2
KING
LAFEU
FEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. I think so.
  PAROLLES. 
2
KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Why, do you not know him?
  BERTRAM.

KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech

KING
LAFEU
LENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. I shall obey his will.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. Sir, I can nothing say
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. And ever shall

2
KING
LAFEU
RTRAM. Let that go.
  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.
  BERTRAM. 
2
KING
LAFEU

    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.

    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;

    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a

2
KING
LAFEU
LENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very

  HELENA. 
2
KING
LAFEU

KING
LAFEU

2
KING
LAFEU

KING
LAFEU
ROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
  CLOWN.

  HELENA. 
2
KING

LAFEU
CLOWN
ANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
  KING. 
3
KING
LAFEU
CLOWN
NG. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
  DIANA. 
3
KING
LAFEU
CLOWN
ANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
  KING. 
3
KING

CLOWN

WIDOW
ANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;
                                                      Exit WIDOW
    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.
