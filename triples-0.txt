You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.

Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

She's none of mine, my lord.

What of him?

She hath that ring of yours.
BERTRAM

I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,

I must be patient.

The story, then, goes false you threw it him
DIANA

I have spoke the truth.
BERTRAM

My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

Ay, my lord.

KING

Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?
PAROLLES
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
KING
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
How, I pray you?
PAROLLES
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
KING
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
How is that?
PAROLLES
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
KING
2
LAFEU

As thou art a knave and no knave.

Do you know he promis'd me marriage?
PAROLLES

LAFEU
CLOWN
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
KING

But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
PAROLLES

Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I

Ay, my good lord.
KING
2

Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
DIANA
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
KING
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
Who lent it you?
DIANA
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
It was not lent me neither.
KING

Where did you find it then?
DIANA
2

I found it not.
KING

If it were yours by none of all these ways,

I never gave it him.

This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.

KING

LAFEU
CLOWN
Take her away, I do not like her now;
DIANA
2
LAFEU

I'll never tell you.
KING

Take her away.
DIANA

I'll put in bail, my liege.
KING

I think thee now some common customer.
DIANA

By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
KING
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
DIANA
2
LAFEU
CLOWN
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
KING

CLOWN
She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.
DIANA

Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;

    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.
