LBOT. With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
    In open market-place produc'd they me
    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel

    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.
                         Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,

    O, where's young Talbot? Where is valiant John?
    Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
    Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee.
    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

    See! they forsake me. Now the time is come
    That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest
    And let her head fall into England's lap.
    My ancient incantations are too weak,
    And hell too strong for me to buckle with.

    In open market-place produc'd they me
    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,
    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.
                         Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,

    Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
    O, negligent and heedless discipline!
    How are we park'd and bounded in a pale
    A little herd of England's timorous deer,
    Maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs!
    If we be English deer, be then in blood;
    Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch,
    But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
    Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
    And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.
    Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
    And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
    God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,
    Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!          Exeunt

    O, where's young Talbot? Where is valiant John?
    Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

    And fitter is my study and my books
    Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
    Yet call th' ambassadors, and, as you please,
    So let them have their answers every one.

LBOT. With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
    In open market-place produc'd they me
    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,
    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

GLOUCESTER
LBOT. What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]
    What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
    Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

LBOT. With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
    In open market-place produc'd they me
    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,
    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

GLOUCESTER
LBOT. What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]
    What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
    Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,
    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

GLOUCESTER
LBOT. What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]
    What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
    Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

    In open market-place produc'd they me
    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,
    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

SALISBURY

GLOUCESTER
LBOT. What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]
    What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
    Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

LBOT. With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
    In open market-place produc'd they me
    To be a public spectacle to all;
    Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
    The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    Then broke I from the officers that led me,
    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
    My grisly countenance made others fly;
    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
    And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
    That walk'd about me every minute-while;
    And if I did but stir out of my bed,
    Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

LBOT. What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
    Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
    His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
    Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
    One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
    Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
    Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
    Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    Thou shalt not die whiles
    He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
    Remember to avenge me on the French.'
    Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
    Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    Wretched shall France be only in my name.
                  [Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]

NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.
                         Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,

    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
    And like a hungry lion did commence
    Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
    But when my angry guardant stood alone,
    Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none,
    Dizzy-ey'd fury and great rage of heart
    Suddenly made him from my side to start
    Into the clust'ring battle of the French;
    And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
    His overmounting spirit; and there died,
    My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

OUCESTER. Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. How were they lost? What treachery was us'd?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money.
  EXETER.

ARLES. Sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Who ever saw the like? What men have I!
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
  ALENCON.

ENCON. Froissart, a countryman of ours, records

ARLES. Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd

CELLE. Reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. I am prepar'd; here is my keen-edg'd sword,
  CHARLES.

ARLES. Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. And while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man.
  CHARLES.

ARLES. Stay, stay thy hands; thou art an Amazon,

CELLE. Christ's Mother helps me, else I were too weak.
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me.
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. I must not yield to any rites of love,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. He may mean more than we poor men do know;
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Why, no, I say; distrustful recreants!
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  REIGNIER.

IGNIER. Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;

  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. And I.
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. Then, for the truth and plainness of the case,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Well, well, come on; who else?
  LAWYER. 
0
WYER.  [To Somerset]  Unless my study and my books be
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Here in my scabbard, meditating that
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. No, Plantagenet,
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Away, away, good William de la Pole!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. He bears him on the place's privilege,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. My father was attached, not attainted;
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ay, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Go forward, and be chok'd with thy ambition!
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. How I am brav'd, and must perforce endure
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This blot that they object against your house
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. In your behalf still will I wear the same.
  LAWYER.

  PLANTAGENET.

ANTAGENET. Thanks, gentle sir.
  MORTIMER.

RTIMER. Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

RST KEEPER. Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come.
  MORTIMER. 
0
RTIMER. Enough; my soul shall then be satisfied.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
  MORTIMER. 
0
RTIMER. Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us'd,
  MORTIMER. 
0
RTIMER. Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
  MORTIMER. 
0
RTIMER. That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Discover more at large what cause that was,
  MORTIMER. 
0
RTIMER. I will, if that my fading breath permit
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  MORTIMER. 
0
RTIMER. True; and thou seest that I no issue have,
  PLANTAGENET. 
0
ANTAGENET. Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
  MORTIMER.

RTIMER. With silence, nephew, be thou politic;

OUCESTER. Presumptuous priest, this place commands my

NCHESTER. Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. As good!
  WINCHESTER. 
0
NCHESTER. Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Am I not Protector, saucy priest?
  WINCHESTER. 
0
NCHESTER. And am not I a prelate of the church?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps,
  WINCHESTER. 
0
NCHESTER. Unreverent Gloucester!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thou art reverend
  WINCHESTER. 
0
NCHESTER. Rome shall remedy this.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Roam thither then.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Methinks my lord should be religious,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
  WARWICK.

RWICK. State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?

NCHESTER. He shall submit, or I will never yield.
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. Compassion on the King commands me stoop,
  WARWICK.

RWICK. Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
  KING

  WARWICK.

OUCESTER. Well urg'd, my Lord of Warwick; for, sweet

  WARWICK.

RWICK. Let Richard be restored to his blood;

  KING

  PLANTAGENET.

ANTAGENET. Thy humble servant vows obedience

ENCON. By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
  PUCELLE, 
0
CELLE, that witch, that damned sorceress,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Good morrow, gallants! Want ye corn for bread?
  BURGUNDY. 
0
RGUNDY. Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan.
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time.
  BEDFORD. 
0
DFORD. O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. What you do, good grey beard? Break a
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Are ye so hot, sir? Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. I speak not to that railing Hecate,
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. Signior, no.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Signior, hang! Base muleteers of France!
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. Away, captains! Let's get us from the walls;
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. And there will we be too, ere it be long,
  BURGUNDY. 
0
RGUNDY. My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. But ere we go, regard this dying prince,
  BEDFORD. 
0
DFORD. Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me;
  BURGUNDY. 
0
RGUNDY. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.
  BEDFORD. 
0
DFORD. Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
  TALBOT.

LBOT. Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
  CAPTAIN.

PTAIN. Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?
  FASTOLFE.

STOLFE. Whither away? To save myself by flight:
  CAPTAIN.

PTAIN. What! Will you and leave Lord Talbot?
  FASTOLFE.

STOLFE. Ay,

PTAIN. Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!

  BURGUNDY.

RGUNDY. Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
  TALBOT.

LBOT. Thanks, gentle Duke. But where is Pucelle now?
  BURGUNDY.

RGUNDY. What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
  TALBOT.

LBOT. But yet, before we go, let's not forget
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. Dismay not, Princes, at this accident,
  CHARLES.

ARLES. We have guided by thee hitherto,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Search out thy wit for secret policies,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. For ever should they be expuls'd from France,
  PUCELLE.

ARLES. A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
  BURGUNDY.

RGUNDY. Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
  PUCELLE.

  BURGUNDY.

RGUNDY. What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching

RGUNDY. Speak on; but be not over-tedious.
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
  BURGUNDY. 
0
RGUNDY. Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
  BURGUNDY. 
0
RGUNDY. I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. Done like a Frenchman-  [Aside]  turn and turn
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Welcome, brave Duke! Thy friendship makes us
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
  ALENCON. 
0
ENCON. Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. My gracious Prince, and honourable peers,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Yes, if it please your Majesty, my liege.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
  VERNON.

RNON. Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. Why, what is he? As good a man as York!
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. Hark ye: not so. In witness, take ye that.
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. Villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head.
  WINCHESTER. 
0
NCHESTER. God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath
  FASTOLFE. 
0
STOLFE. My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. To say the truth, this fact was infamous
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER.  [Viewing the superscription]  What means his
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. What! Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Content, my liege! Yes; but that I am prevented,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Then gather strength and march unto him
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. I go, my lord, in heart desiring still
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.
  YORK. 
0
RK. This is my servant: hear him, noble Prince.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. What is that wrong whereof you both
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. Crossing the sea from England into France,
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. And that is my petition, noble lord;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick
  YORK. 
0
RK. Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
  YORK. 
0
RK. There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.
  VERNON. 
0
RNON. Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  BASSET. 
0
SSET. Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife;
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. My Lord of York, I promise you, the King
  YORK. 
0
RK. And so he did; but yet I like it not,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not;
  YORK. 
0
RK. An if I wist he did-but let it rest;
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter;
  GENERAL 
0
NERAL OF THE FRENCH. Thou ominous and fearful owl of
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Are not the speedy scouts return'd again
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. They are return'd, my lord, and give it out
  YORK. 
0
RK. A plague upon that villain Somerset
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Thou princely leader of our English strength,
  YORK. 
0
RK. O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart
  LUCY. 
0
CY. O, send some succour to the distress'd lord!
  YORK. 
0
RK. He dies; we lose; I break my warlike word.
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Thus, while the vulture of sedition
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. It is too late; I cannot send them now.
  OFFICER. 
0
FICER. Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. How now, Sir William! Whither were you sent?
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Whither, my lord! From bought and sold Lord
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. York set him on; York should have sent him aid.
  LUCY. 
0
CY. And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. York lies; he might have sent and had the horse.
  LUCY. 
0
CY. The fraud of England, not the force of France,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight;
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Too late comes rescue; he is ta'en or slain,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. If he be dead, brave Talbot, then, adieu!
  LUCY. 
0
CY. His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.       Exeunt
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
  JOHN. 
0
HN. Is my name Talbot, and am I your son?
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Fly to revenge my death, if I be slain.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. He that flies so will ne'er return again.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
  JOHN. 
0
HN. Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Upon my blessing I command thee go.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Part of thy father may be sav'd in thee.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. No part of him but will be shame in me.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. Yes, your renowned name; shall flight abuse it?
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. You cannot witness for me, being slain.
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. And leave my followers here to fight and die?
  JOHN. 
0
HN. And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Saint George and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck
  JOHN. 
0
HN. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete,
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Where is my other life? Mine own is gone.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!
  TALBOT. 
0
LBOT. Thou antic Death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging wood,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Once I encount'red him, and thus I said:
  BURGUNDY. 
0
RGUNDY. Doubtless he would have made a noble knight.
  BASTARD. 
0
STARD. Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. O, no; forbear! For that which we have fled
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. On what submissive message art thou sent?
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Submission, Dauphin! 'Tis a mere French word:
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. For prisoners ask'st thou? Hell our prison is.
  LUCY. 
0
CY. But where's the great Alcides of the field,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Here's a silly-stately style indeed!
  LUCY. 
0
CY. Is Talbot slain-the Frenchmen's only scourge,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Go, take their bodies hence.
  LUCY. 
0
CY. I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. So we be rid of them, do with them what thou
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Have you perus'd the letters from the Pope,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I have, my lord; and their intent is this:
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. How doth your Grace affect their motion?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Well, my good lord, and as the only means

ARLES. Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
  BURGUNDY.

RGUNDY. I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there.

CELLE. Of all base passions fear is most accurs'd.
  CHARLES.

ARLES. Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. The Regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly.

CELLE. Chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be.
  YORK.

CELLE. A plaguing mischief fight on Charles and thee!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Fell banning hag; enchantress, hold thy tongue.
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. I prithee give me leave to curse awhile.
  YORK.

FFOLK. Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
  MARGARET.

RGARET. Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,

RGARET. Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
  SUFFOLK.

RGARET. What?
  SUFFOLK.

RGARET. I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.

RGARET. An if my father please, I am content.
  SUFFOLK.

IGNIER. To whom?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. To me.
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. Suffolk, what remedy?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Fair Margaret knows

IGNIER. Upon thy princely warrant I descend

  REIGNIER.

IGNIER. Welcome, brave Earl, into our territories;
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
  REIGNIER. 
0
IGNIER. Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth

FFOLK. That is her ransom; I deliver her.
  REIGNIER.

IGNIER. And I again, in Henry's royal name,
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,

FFOLK. Farewell, sweet madam. But hark you, Margaret
  MARGARET. 
0
RGARET. Such commendations as becomes a maid,

FFOLK. Words sweetly plac'd and modestly directed.
  MARGARET. 
0
RGARET. Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,

FFOLK. And this withal.                         [Kisses her]
  MARGARET. 
0
RGARET. That for thyself, I will not so presume
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;
  YORK.

RK. Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.
  SHEPHERD. 
0
EPHERD. Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
  SHEPHERD. 
0
EPHERD. Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
  WARWICK.

RWICK. Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?

  SHEPHERD.

EPHERD. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man
  SHEPHERD. 
0
EPHERD. 'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
  YORK. 
0
RK. Take her away; for she hath liv'd too long,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. First let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
  YORK. 
0
RK. Ay, ay. Away with her to execution!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
  YORK. 
0
RK. Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
  YORK. 
0
RK. She and the Dauphin have been juggling.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. You are deceiv'd; my child is none of his:
  YORK. 
0
RK. Alencon, that notorious Machiavel!
  PUCELLE. 
0
CELLE. O, give me leave, I have deluded you.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. A married man! That's most intolerable.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
  YORK. 
0
RK. And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
  PUCELLE.

CELLE. Then lead me hence-with whom I leave my

  YORK. 
0
RK. Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,
  CHARLES.

ARLES. Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
  YORK.

RK. Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
  CARDINAL.

RDINAL. Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
  ALENCON.

  REIGNIER.

IGNIER.  [To CHARLES]  My lord, you do not well in

  WARWICK.

RWICK. How say'st thou, Charles? Shall our condition

  KING

FFOLK. Tush, my good lord! This superficial tale
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. So should I give consent to flatter sin.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Yes, my lord, her father is a king,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower;
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. A dow'r, my lords! Disgrace not so your king,

ETER. How were they lost? What treachery was us'd?
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money.

    Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;
    By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

BASTARD
CHARLES
ARLES. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.

BASTARD
CHARLES

BASTARD
CHARLES

BASTARD
CHARLES

  REIGNIER.

BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
  ALENCON.

BASTARD

ENCON. Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
  REIGNIER. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
  ALENCON. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
ENCON. He may mean more than we poor men do know;
  REIGNIER.

BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
  PUCELLE.

BASTARD

BASTARD
CHARLES
ARLES. What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.
  PUCELLE.

BASTARD
CHARLES
CELLE. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.

BASTARD

IGNIER. Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;

CHARLES

LBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
    I know not where I am nor what I do.
    A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
    Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists.
    So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
    Are from their hives and houses driven away.
    They call'd us, for our fierceness, English dogs;
    Now like to whelps we crying run away.
                                                [A short alarum]
    Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight
    Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
    Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
    Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
    Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
    As you fly from your oft subdued slaves.
                                 [Alarum. Here another skirmish]
    It will not be-retire into your trenches.
    You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
    For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
    Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans
    In spite of us or aught that we could do.
    O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
    The shame hereof will make me hide my head.

  KING

PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
NG HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants:
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.
                         Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,

BASTARD
CHARLES

PORTER

  WARWICK. 
5

BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
  YORK.

PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES

  WARWICK.

CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER

    Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;

BASTARD
CHARLES

  REIGNIER. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
  ALENCON.

BASTARD
CHARLES
ENCON. Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
  REIGNIER. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
  ALENCON. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
ENCON. He may mean more than we poor men do know;
  REIGNIER. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
  PUCELLE. 
2
BASTARD

  CHARLES. 
2
BASTARD

  PUCELLE. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
CELLE. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.

BASTARD

BASTARD
CHARLES
ENCON. Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
  REIGNIER.

BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;

CHARLES
NCHESTER. Nay, stand thou back; I will not budge a foot.

CHARLES

LBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
    I know not where I am nor what I do.
    A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
    Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists.
    So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
    Are from their hives and houses driven away.
    They call'd us, for our fierceness, English dogs;
    Now like to whelps we crying run away.
                                                [A short alarum]
    Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight
    Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
    Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
    Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
    Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
    As you fly from your oft subdued slaves.
                                 [Alarum. Here another skirmish]
    It will not be-retire into your trenches.
    You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
    For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
    Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans
    In spite of us or aught that we could do.
    O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
    The shame hereof will make me hide my head.

    Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks
    And that within ourselves we disagree,
    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
    I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
                                         [Putting on a red rose]
    That any one should therefore be suspicious
    I more incline to Somerset than York:
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.
                         Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,

  ALENCON.

  REIGNIER. 
2
BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
  ALENCON. 
2
BASTARD

BASTARD
CHARLES
IGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
  PUCELLE.

    Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels
    And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
    Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
    And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.

PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
MAYOR
LBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
    I know not where I am nor what I do.
    A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
    Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists.
    So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
    Are from their hives and houses driven away.
    They call'd us, for our fierceness, English dogs;
    Now like to whelps we crying run away.
                                                [A short alarum]
    Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight
    Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
    Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
    Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
    Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
    As you fly from your oft subdued slaves.
                                 [Alarum. Here another skirmish]
    It will not be-retire into your trenches.
    You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
    For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
    Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans
    In spite of us or aught that we could do.
    O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
    The shame hereof will make me hide my head.

    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
    In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;
    If they perceive dissension in our looks

    How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
    To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
    Beside, what infamy will there arise
    When foreign princes shall be certified
    That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
    King Henry's peers and chief nobility
    Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France!
    O, think upon the conquest of my father,
    My tender years; and let us not forgo
    That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
    Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.

    That any one should therefore be suspicious

    Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd.
    But your discretions better can persuade
    Than I am able to instruct or teach;
    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
    To be our Regent in these parts of France.
    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
    Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
    And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
    Go cheerfully together and digest
    Your angry choler on your enemies.
    Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
    After some respite will return to Calais;
    From thence to England, where I hope ere long
    To be presented by your victories
    With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout.
                         Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK,

PORTER
RGARET. That for thyself, I will not so presume
    To send such peevish tokens to a king.

CHARLES

PORTER
FFOLK. O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;

PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.
  SHEPHERD.

PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
EPHERD. Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
  SHEPHERD. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
EPHERD. Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. This argues what her kind of life hath been-
  SHEPHERD. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
EPHERD. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man
  SHEPHERD. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
EPHERD. 'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Take her away; for she hath liv'd too long,
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. First let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Ay, ay. Away with her to execution!
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child!
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. She and the Dauphin have been juggling.
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. You are deceiv'd; my child is none of his:
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Alencon, that notorious Machiavel!
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. O, give me leave, I have deluded you.
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. A married man! That's most intolerable.
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
  PUCELLE. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
CELLE. Then lead me hence-with whom I leave my
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,
  CARDINAL. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RDINAL. Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,
  CHARLES. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
ARLES. Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
  CARDINAL. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RDINAL. Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
  ALENCON. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
ENCON. Must he be then as shadow of himself?
  CHARLES. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
ARLES. 'Tis known already that I am possess'd
  YORK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RK. Insulting Charles! Hast thou by secret means
  REIGNIER. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
IGNIER.  [To CHARLES]  My lord, you do not well in
  ALENCON. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
ENCON.  [To CHARLES]  To say the truth, it is your policy
  WARWICK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
RWICK. How say'st thou, Charles? Shall our condition
  CHARLES. 
5
PUCELLE

  GLOUCESTER. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
OUCESTER. So should I give consent to flatter sin.
  SUFFOLK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
FFOLK. As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
  GLOUCESTER. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
OUCESTER. Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than
  SUFFOLK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
FFOLK. Yes, my lord, her father is a king,
  GLOUCESTER. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
OUCESTER. And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
  EXETER. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
ETER. Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower;
  SUFFOLK. 
5
PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER
FFOLK. A dow'r, my lords! Disgrace not so your king,
  KING

PUCELLE
BASTARD
CHARLES
TALBOT
PORTER

  GLOUCESTER.
