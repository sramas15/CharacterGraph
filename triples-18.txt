FIRST WITCH
0
When shall we three meet again?
SECOND WITCH
0
When the hurlyburly's done,
THIRD WITCH
0
That will be ere the set of sun.
FIRST WITCH
0
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH
0
Upon the heath.
THIRD WITCH
0
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH
0
I come, Graymalkin.
ALL
0
Paddock calls. Anon!
DUNCAN
0
What bloody man is that? He can report,
MALCOLM
0
This is the sergeant
SERGEANT
0
Doubtful it stood,
DUNCAN
0
O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!
SERGEANT
0
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
DUNCAN
0
Dismay'd not this
SERGEANT
0
Yes,
DUNCAN
0
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
LENNOX
0
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
ROSS
0
God save the King!
DUNCAN
0
Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?
ROSS
0
From Fife, great King,
DUNCAN
0
Great happiness!
ROSS
0
That now
DUNCAN
0
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
ROSS
0
I'll see it done.
DUNCAN
0
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
FIRST WITCH
0
Where hast thou been, sister?
SECOND WITCH
0
Killing swine.
THIRD WITCH
0
Sister, where thou?
FIRST WITCH
0
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
SECOND WITCH
0
I'll give thee a wind.
FIRST WITCH
0
Thou'rt kind.
THIRD WITCH
0
And I another.
FIRST WITCH
0
I myself have all the other,
SECOND WITCH
0
Show me, show me.
FIRST WITCH
0
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
THIRD WITCH
0
A drum, a drum!
ALL
0
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
MACBETH
0
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO
0
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
MACBETH
0
Speak, if you can. What are you?
FIRST WITCH
0
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
SECOND WITCH
0
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THIRD WITCH
0
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!
BANQUO
0
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
FIRST WITCH
0
Hail!
SECOND WITCH
0
Hail!
THIRD WITCH
0
Hail!
FIRST WITCH
0
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
SECOND WITCH
0
Not so happy, yet much happier.
THIRD WITCH
0
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
FIRST WITCH
0
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH
0
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
BANQUO
0
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
MACBETH
0
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted
BANQUO
0
Were such things here as we do speak about?
MACBETH
0
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO
0
You shall be King.
MACBETH
0
And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?
BANQUO
0
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
ROSS
0
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
ANGUS
0
We are sent
ROSS
0
And for an earnest of a greater honor,
BANQUO
0
What, can the devil speak true?
MACBETH
0
The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me
ANGUS
0
Who was the Thane lives yet,
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
BANQUO
0
[Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] Two truths are told,
BANQUO
0
Look, how our partner's rapt.
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] If chance will have me King, why, chance may
BANQUO
0
New honors come upon him,
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] Come what come may,
BANQUO
0
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH
0
Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought
BANQUO
0
Very gladly.
MACBETH
0
Till then, enough. Come, friends.             Exeunt.
DUNCAN
0
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
MALCOLM
0
My liege,
DUNCAN
0
There's no art
MACBETH
0
The service and the loyalty lowe,
DUNCAN
0
Welcome hither.
BANQUO
0
There if I grow,
DUNCAN
0
My plenteous joys,
MACBETH
0
The rest is labor, which is not used for you.
DUNCAN
0
My worthy Cawdor!
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step
DUNCAN
0
True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant,
LADY MACBETH
0
"They met me in the day of success, and I have
MESSENGER
0
The King comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH
0
Thou'rt mad to say it!
MESSENGER
0
So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
LADY MACBETH
0
Give him tending;
MACBETH
0
My dearest love,
LADY MACBETH
0
And when goes hence?
MACBETH
0
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH
0
O, never
MACBETH
0
We will speak further.
LADY MACBETH
0
Only look up clear;
DUNCAN
0
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
BANQUO
0
This guest of summer,
DUNCAN
0
See, see, our honor'd hostess!
LADY MACBETH
0
All our service
DUNCAN
0
Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
LADY MACBETH
0
Your servants ever
DUNCAN
0
Give me your hand;
DUNCAN

MACBETH
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Hath he ask'd for me?
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Know you not he has?
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
We will proceed no further in this business:
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Was the hope drunk
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Prithee, peace!
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
What beast wast then
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
If we should fail?
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
We fail?
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Bring forth men-children only,
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Who dares receive it other,
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
I am settled and bend up
BANQUO
0
How goes the night, boy?
FLEANCE
0
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
BANQUO
0
And she goes down at twelve.
FLEANCE
0
I take't 'tis later, sir.
BANQUO
0
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven,
MACBETH
0
A friend.
BANQUO
0
What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed.
MACBETH
0
Being unprepared,
BANQUO
0
All's well.
MACBETH
0
I think not of them;
BANQUO
0
At your kind'st leisure.
MACBETH
0
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
BANQUO
0
So I lose none
MACBETH
0
Good repose the while.
BANQUO
0
Thanks, sir, the like to you.
MACBETH
0
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
LADY MACBETH
0
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
MACBETH
0
[Within.] Who's there' what, ho!
LADY MACBETH
0
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked
MACBETH
0
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
LADY MACBETH
0
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
MACBETH
0
When?
LADY MACBETH
0
Now.
MACBETH
0
As I descended?
LADY MACBETH
0
Ay.
MACBETH
0
Hark!
LADY MACBETH
0
Donalbain.
MACBETH
0
This is a sorry sight.           [Looks on his hands.
LADY MACBETH
0
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH
0
There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried,
LADY MACBETH
0
There are two lodged together.
MACBETH
0
One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other,
LADY MACBETH
0
Consider it not so deeply.
MACBETH
0
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
LADY MACBETH
0
These deeds must not be thought
MACBETH
0
I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
LADY MACBETH
0
What do you mean?
MACBETH
0
Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house;
LADY MACBETH
0
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy Thane,
MACBETH
0
I'll go no more.
LADY MACBETH
0
Infirm of purpose!
MACBETH
0
Whence is that knocking?
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
Whence is that knocking?
    How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
    What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!
    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.
LADY MACBETH
1
MACBETH
My hands are of your color, but I shame
MACBETH
1
MACBETH
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
PORTER
0
Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of Hell
MACDUFF
0
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
PORTER
0
Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and
MACDUFF
0
What three things does drink especially provoke?
PORTER
0
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir,
MACDUFF
0
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
PORTER
0
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited
MACDUFF
0
Is thy master stirring?
LENNOX
0
Good morrow, noble sir.
MACBETH
0
morrow, both.
MACDUFF
0
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
MACBETH
0
Not yet.
MACDUFF
0
He did command me to call timely on him;
MACBETH
0
I'll bring you to him.
MACDUFF
0
I know this is a joyful trouble to you,
MACBETH
0
The labor we delight in physics pain.
LENNOX
0
Goes the King hence today?
MACBETH
0
He does; he did appoint so.
LENNOX
0
The night has been unruly. Where we lay,
MACBETH
0
'Twas a rough fight.
LENNOX
0
My young remembrance cannot parallel
LENNOX
1
MACDUFF
My young remembrance cannot parallel
    A fellow to it.
MACDUFF
1
MACDUFF
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
MACBETH
1
MACDUFF
LENNOX. What's the matter?
MACDUFF
1
MACDUFF
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
MACBETH
1
MACDUFF
What is't you say? the life?
LENNOX
1
MACDUFF
Mean you his Majesty?
MACDUFF
1
MACDUFF
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
MACDUFF
1
MACDUFF
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
    With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak;
    See, and then speak yourselves.
                                      Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.
LADY MACBETH
1
MACDUFF
What's the business,
MACDUFF
1
MACDUFF
O gentle lady,
LADY MACBETH
1
MACDUFF
Woe, alas!
BANQUO
1
MACDUFF
Too cruel anywhere.
BANQUO
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Too cruel anywhere.
    Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
    And say it is not so.
MACBETH
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
DONALBAIN
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
What is amiss?
MACBETH
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
You are, and do not know't.
MACDUFF
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Your royal father's murther'd.
LENNOX
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done't.
MACBETH
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
MACDUFF
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Wherefore did you so?
MACBETH
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
LADY MACBETH
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Help me hence, ho!
MACDUFF
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Look to the lady.
MALCOLM
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
[Aside to Donalbain.] Why do we hold our tongues,
DONALBAIN
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
[Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here, where
MALCOLM
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
[Aside to Donalbain.] Nor our strong sorrow
BANQUO
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Look to the lady.
MACDUFF
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
And so do I.
ALL
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
So all.
MACBETH
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Let's briefly put on manly readiness
ALL
2
MACDUFF
MACBETH
Well contented.
ALL

MACDUFF
MACBETH
Well contented.
                           Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
MALCOLM

MACDUFF
MACBETH
What will you do? Let's not consort with them.
DONALBAIN

MACDUFF
MACBETH
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune

MACDUFF
MACBETH
This murtherous shaft that's shot
OLD MAN
0
Threescore and ten I can remember well,
ROSS
0
Ah, good father,
OLD MAN
0
'Tis unnatural,
ROSS
0
And Duncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain-
OLD MAN
0
'Tis said they eat each other.
ROSS
0
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
MACDUFF
0
Why, see you not?
ROSS
0
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
MACDUFF
0
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
ROSS
0
Alas, the day!
MACDUFF
0
They were suborn'd:
ROSS
0
'Gainst nature still!
MACDUFF
0
He is already named, and gone to Scone
ROSS
0
Where is Duncan's body?
MACDUFF
0
Carried to Colmekill,
ROSS
0
Will you to Scone?
MACDUFF
0
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
ROSS
0
Well, I will thither.
MACDUFF
0
Well, may you see things well done there.
ROSS
0
Farewell, father.
OLD MAN
0
God's benison go with you and with those
BANQUO
0
Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
MACBETH
0
Here's our chief guest.
LADY MACBETH
0
If he had been forgotten,
MACBETH
0
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
BANQUO
0
Let your Highness
MACBETH
0
Ride you this afternoon?
BANQUO
0
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH
0
We should have else desired your good advice,
BANQUO
0
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
MACBETH
0
Fail not our feast.
BANQUO
0
My lord, I will not.
MACBETH
0
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
BANQUO
0
Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon 's.
MACBETH
0
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,
ATTENDANT
0
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
MACBETH
0
Bring them before us.                 Exit Attendant.
MACBETH
1
ATTENDANT
Bring them before us.                 Exit Attendant.
    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?
FIRST MURTHERER
0
It was, so please your Highness.
MACBETH
0
Well then, now
FIRST MURTHERER
0
You made it known to us.
MACBETH
0
I did so, and went further, which is now
FIRST MURTHERER
0
We are men, my liege.
MACBETH
0
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,
SECOND MURTHERER
0
I am one, my liege,
FIRST MURTHERER
0
And I another
MACBETH
0
Both of you
BOTH MURTHERERS
0
True, my lord.
MACBETH
0
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance
SECOND MURTHERER
0
We shall, my lord,
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Though our lives-
MACBETH
0
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
BOTH MURTHERERS
0
We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH
0
I'll call upon you straight. Abide within.
LADY MACBETH
0
Is Banquo gone from court?
SERVANT
0
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
LADY MACBETH
0
Say to the King I would attend his leisure
SERVANT
0
Madam, I will.                                  Exit.
LADY MACBETH
0
Nought's had, all's spent,
MACBETH
0
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.
LADY MACBETH
0
Come on,
MACBETH
0
So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.
LADY MACBETH
0
You must leave this.
MACBETH
0
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
LADY MACBETH
0
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
MACBETH
0
There's comfort yet; they are assailable.
LADY MACBETH
0
What's to be done?
MACBETH
0
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
FIRST MURTHERER
0
But who did bid thee join with us?
THIRD MURTHERER
0
Macbeth.
SECOND MURTHERER
0
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Then stand with us.
THIRD MURTHERER
0
Hark! I hear horses.
BANQUO
0
[Within.] Give us a light there, ho!
SECOND MURTHERER
0
Then 'tis he; the rest
FIRST MURTHERER
0
His horses go about.
THIRD MURTHERER
0
Almost a mile, but he does usually-
SECOND MURTHERER
0
A light, a light!
THIRD MURTHERER
0
'Tis he.
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Stand to't.
BANQUO
0
It will be rain tonight.
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Let it come down.
BANQUO
0
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
THIRD MURTHERER
0
Who did strike out the light?
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Wast not the way?
THIRD MURTHERER
0
There's but one down; the son is fled.
SECOND MURTHERER
0
We have lost
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Well, let's away and say how much is done.
MACBETH
0
You know your own degrees; sit down. At first
LORDS
0
Thanks to your Majesty.
MACBETH
0
Ourself will mingle with society
LADY MACBETH
0
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
MACBETH
0
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
MURTHERER
0
'Tis Banquo's then.
MACBETH
0
'Tis better thee without than he within.
MURTHERER
0
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
MACBETH
0
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats! Yet he's good
MURTHERER
0
Most royal sir,
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,
MURTHERER
0
Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,
MACBETH
0
Thanks for that.
LADY MACBETH
0
My royal lord,
MACBETH
0
Sweet remembrancer!
LENNOX
0
May't please your Highness sit.
MACBETH
0
Here had we now our country's honor roof'd,
ROSS
0
His absence, sir,
MACBETH
0
The table's full.
LENNOX
0
Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACBETH
0
Where?
LENNOX
0
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your Highness?
MACBETH
0
Which of you have done this?
LORDS
0
What, my good lord?
MACBETH
0
Thou canst not say I did it; never shake
ROSS
0
Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is well.
LADY MACBETH
0
Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,
MACBETH
0
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
LADY MACBETH
0
O proper stuff!
MACBETH
0
Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?
LADY MACBETH
0
What, quite unmann'd in folly?
MACBETH
0
If I stand here, I saw him.
LADY MACBETH
0
Fie, for shame!
MACBETH
0
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
LADY MACBETH
0
My worthy lord,
MACBETH
0
I do forget.
LORDS
0
Our duties and the pledge.
MACBETH
0
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
LADY MACBETH
0
Think of this, good peers,
MACBETH
0
What man dare, I dare.
LADY MACBETH
0
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
MACBETH
0
Can such things be,
ROSS
0
What sights, my lord?
LADY MACBETH
0
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
LENNOX
0
Good night, and better health
LADY MACBETH
0
A kind good night to all!
MACBETH
0
will have blood; they say blood will have blood.
LADY MACBETH
0
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
MACBETH
0
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
LADY MACBETH
0
Did you send to him, sir?
MACBETH
0
I hear it by the way, but I will send.
LADY MACBETH
0
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
MACBETH
0
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
FIRST WITCH
0
Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.
HECATE
0
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
FIRST WITCH
0
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
LENNOX
0
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
LORD
0
The son of Duncan,
LENNOX
0
Sent he to Macduff?
LORD
0
He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"
LENNOX
0
And that well might
LORD
0
I'll send my prayers with him.
FIRST WITCH
0
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
SECOND WITCH
0
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
THIRD WITCH
0
Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time."
FIRST WITCH
0
Round about the cauldron go;
ALL
0
Double, double, toil and trouble;
SECOND WITCH
0
Fillet of a fenny snake,
ALL
0
Double, double, toil and trouble;
THIRD WITCH
0
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
ALL
0
Double, double, toil and trouble;
SECOND WITCH
0
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
HECATE
0
O, well done! I commend your pains,
SECOND WITCH
0
By the pricking of my thumbs,
MACBETH
0
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
ALL
0
A deed without a name.
MACBETH
0
I conjure you, by that which you profess
FIRST WITCH
0
Speak.
SECOND WITCH
0
Demand.
THIRD WITCH
0
We'll answer.
FIRST WITCH
0
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
MACBETH
0
Call 'em, let me see 'em.
FIRST WITCH
0
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten
ALL
0
Come, high or low;
MACBETH
0
Tell me, thou unknown power-
FIRST WITCH
0
He knows thy thought:
FIRST APPARITION
0
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,
MACBETH
0
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
FIRST WITCH
0
He will not be commanded. Here's another,
SECOND APPARITION
0
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
MACBETH
0
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
SECOND APPARITION
0
Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn
MACBETH
0
Then live, Macduff. What need I fear of thee?
ALL
0
Listen, but speak not to't.
THIRD APPARITION
0
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
MACBETH
0
That will never be.
ALL
0
Seek to know no more.
MACBETH
0
I will be satisfied! Deny me this,
FIRST WITCH
0
Show!
SECOND WITCH
0
Show!
THIRD
0
WITCH. Show!
ALL
0
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
MACBETH
0
Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down!
FIRST WITCH
0
Ay, sir, all this is so. But why
MACBETH
0
are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
LENNOX
0
What's your Grace's will?
MACBETH
0
Saw you the weird sisters?
LENNOX
0
No, my lord.
MACBETH
0
Came they not by you?
LENNOX
0
No indeed, my lord.
MACBETH
0
Infected be the 'air whereon they ride,
LENNOX
0
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
MACBETH
0
Fled to England?
LENNOX
0
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH
0
[Aside.] Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.
LADY MACDUFF
0
What had he done, to make him fly the land?
ROSS
0
You must have patience, madam.
LADY MACDUFF
0
He had none;
ROSS
0
You know not
LADY MACDUFF
0
Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
ROSS
0
My dearest coz,
LADY MACDUFF
0
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
ROSS
0
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
LADY MACDUFF
0
Sirrah, your father's dead.
SON
0
As birds do, Mother.
LADY MACDUFF
0
What, with worms and flies?
SON
0
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
LADY MACDUFF
0
Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
SON
0
Why should I, Mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
LADY MACDUFF
0
Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father?
SON
0
Nay, how will you do for a husband?
LADY MACDUFF
0
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
SON
0
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
LADY MACDUFF
0
Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i' faith,
SON
0
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
LADY MACDUFF
0
Ay, that he was.
SON
0
What is a traitor?
LADY MACDUFF
0
Why one that swears and lies.
SON
0
And be all traitors that do so?
LADY MACDUFF
0
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be
SON
0
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
LADY MACDUFF
0
Everyone.
SON
0
Who must hang them?
LADY MACDUFF
0
Why, the honest men.
SON
0
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and
LADY MACDUFF
0
Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do
SON
0
If he were dead, you'ld weep for him; if you would not, it
LADY MACDUFF
0
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
MESSENGER
0
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
LADY MACDUFF
0
Whither should I fly?
FIRST MURTHERER
0
Where is your husband?
LADY MACDUFF
0
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
FIRST MURTHERER
0
He's a traitor.
SON
0
Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!
FIRST MURTHERER
0
What, you egg!
SON
0
He has kill'd me, Mother.
MALCOLM
0
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
MACDUFF
0
Let us rather
MALCOLM
0
What I believe, I'll wall;
MACDUFF
0
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM
0
But Macbeth is.
MACDUFF
0
I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM
0
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
MACDUFF
0
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
MALCOLM
0
Be not offended;
MACDUFF
0
What should he be?
MALCOLM
0
It is myself I mean, in whom I know
MACDUFF
0
Not in the legions
MALCOLM
0
I grant him bloody,
MACDUFF
0
Boundless intemperance
MALCOLM
0
With this there grows
MACDUFF
0
This avarice
MALCOLM
0
But I have none. The king-becoming graces,
MACDUFF
0
O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM
0
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
MACDUFF
0
Fit to govern?
MALCOLM
0
Macduff, this noble passion,
MACDUFF
0
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
MALCOLM
0
Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you?
DOCTOR
0
Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls
MALCOLM
0
I thank you, Doctor.                     Exit Doctor.
MACDUFF
0
What's the disease he means?
MALCOLM
0
'Tis call'd the evil:
MACDUFF
0
See, who comes here?
MALCOLM
0
My countryman, but yet I know him not.
MACDUFF
0
My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.
MALCOLM
0
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
ROSS
0
Sir, amen.
MACDUFF
0
Stands Scotland where it did?
ROSS
0
Alas, poor country,
MACDUFF
0
O, relation
MALCOLM
0
What's the newest grief?
ROSS
0
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;
MACDUFF
0
How does my wife?
ROSS
0
Why, well.
MACDUFF
0
And all my children?
ROSS
0
Well too.
MACDUFF
0
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
ROSS
0
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
MACDUFF
0
Be not a niggard of your speech. How goest?
ROSS
0
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
MALCOLM
0
Be't their comfort
ROSS
0
Would I could answer
MACDUFF
0
What concern they?
ROSS
0
No mind that's honest
MACDUFF
0
If it be mine,
ROSS
0
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
MACDUFF
0
Humh! I guess at it.
ROSS
0
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
MALCOLM
0
Merciful heaven!
MACDUFF
0
My children too?
ROSS
0
Wife, children, servants, all
MACDUFF
0
And I must be from thence!
ROSS
0
I have said.
MALCOLM
0
Be comforted.
MACDUFF
0
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
MALCOLM
0
Dispute it like a man.
MACDUFF
0
I shall do so,
MALCOLM
0
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
MACDUFF
0
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
MALCOLM
0
This tune goes manly.
DOCTOR
0
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her
DOCTOR
0
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the
GENTLEWOMAN
0
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
DOCTOR
0
You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to
DOCTOR
0
How came she by that light?
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Why, it stood by her. She has light by her
DOCTOR
0
You see, her eyes are open.
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Ay, but their sense is shut.
DOCTOR
0
What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.
GENTLEWOMAN
0
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
LADY MACBETH
0
Yet here's a spot.
DOCTOR
0
Hark, she speaks! I will set down what comes from her, to
LADY MACBETH
0
Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then 'tis
DOCTOR
0
Do you mark that?
LADY MACBETH
0
The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What,
DOCTOR
0
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
GENTLEWOMAN
0
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.
LADY MACBETH
0
Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes
DOCTOR
0
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
GENTLEWOMAN
0
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
DOCTOR
0
Well, well, well-
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Pray God it be, sir.
DOCTOR
0
This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those
LADY MACBETH
0
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so
DOCTOR
0
Even so?
LADY MACBETH
0
To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come,
DOCTOR
0
Will she go now to bed?
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Directly.
DOCTOR
0
Foul whisperings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
GENTLEWOMAN
0
Good night, good doctor.
MENTEITH
0
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
ANGUS
0
Near Birnam Wood
CAITHNESS
0
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
LENNOX
0
For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file
MENTEITH
0
What does the tyrant?
CAITHNESS
0
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
ANGUS
0
Now does he feel
MENTEITH
0
Who then shall blame
CAITHNESS
0
Well, march we on
LENNOX
0
Or so much as it needs
MACBETH
0
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!
SERVANT
0
There is ten thousand-
MACBETH
0
Geese, villain?
SERVANT
0
Soldiers, sir.
MACBETH
0
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
SERVANT
0
The English force, so please you.
MACBETH
0
Take thy face hence.                    Exit Servant.
SEYTON
0
What's your gracious pleasure?
MACBETH
0
What news more?
SEYTON
0
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
MACBETH
0
I'll fight, 'til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
SEYTON
0
'Tis not needed yet.
MACBETH
0
I'll put it on.
DOCTOR
0
Not so sick, my lord,
MACBETH
0
Cure her of that.
DOCTOR
0
Therein the patient
MACBETH
0
Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.
DOCTOR
0
Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation
MACBETH
0
Bring it after me.
DOCTOR
0
[Aside.] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
MALCOLM
0
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
MENTEITH
0
We doubt it nothing.
SIWARD
0
What wood is this before us?
MENTEITH
0
The Wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM
0
Let every soldier hew him down a bough,
SOLDIERS
0
It shall be done.
SIWARD
0
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
MALCOLM
0
'Tis his main hope;
MACDUFF
0
Let our just censures
SIWARD
0
The time approaches
MACBETH
0
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
SEYTON
0
It is the cry of women, my good lord.            Exit.
MACBETH
0
I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
MACBETH
1
SEYTON
I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
    Cannot once start me.
SEYTON
1
SEYTON
The Queen, my lord, is dead.
MACBETH
1
SEYTON
She should have died hereafter;
MESSENGER
1
SEYTON
Gracious my lord,
MACBETH
1
SEYTON
Well, say, sir.
MESSENGER
1
SEYTON
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
MACBETH
1
SEYTON
Liar and slave!
MESSENGER
1
SEYTON
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.
MACBETH
1
SEYTON
If thou speak'st false,
MALCOLM
0
Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,
SIWARD
0
Fare you well.
MACDUFF
0
Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,
MACBETH
0
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
YOUNG SIWARD
0
What is thy name?
MACBETH
0
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
YOUNG SIWARD
0
No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
MACBETH
0
My name's Macbeth.
YOUNG SIWARD
0
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
MACBETH
0
No, nor more fearful.
MACBETH
0
Thou wast born of woman.
MACDUFF
0
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
SIWARD
0
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.
MALCOLM
0
We have met with foes
SIWARD
0
Enter, sir, the castle.
MACBETH
0
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
MACDUFF
0
Turn, hell hound, turn!
MACBETH
0
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
MACDUFF
0
I have no words.
MACBETH
0
Thou losest labor.
MACDUFF
0
Despair thy charm,
MACBETH
0
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
MACDUFF
0
Then yield thee, coward,
MACBETH
0
I will not yield,
MALCOLM
0
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
SIWARD
0
Some must go off, and yet, by these I see,
MALCOLM
0
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
ROSS
0
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
SIWARD
0
Then he is dead?
ROSS
0
Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
SIWARD
0
Had he his hurts before?
ROSS
0
Ay, on the front.
SIWARD
0
Why then, God's soldier be he!
MALCOLM
0
He's worth more sorrow,
SIWARD
0
He's worth no more:
SIWARD
1
MACDUFF
He's worth no more:
    They say he parted well and paid his score,
    And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
MACDUFF
1
MACDUFF
Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold where stands
ALL
1
MACDUFF
Hail, King of Scotland!                         Flourish.
MALCOLM
1
MACDUFF
We shall not spend a large expense of time
DUKE
0
Escalus!
ESCALUS
0
My lord.
DUKE
0
Of government the properties to unfold
ESCALUS

If any in Vienna be of worth
DUKE

Look where he comes.
ANGELO

Always obedient to your Grace's will,
DUKE

Angelo,
ANGELO
0
Now, good my lord,
DUKE
0
No more evasion!
ANGELO
0
Yet give leave, my lord,
DUKE
0
My haste may not admit it;
ANGELO
0
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ESCALUS
0
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
DUKE
0
I thank you. Fare you well.                         Exit
ESCALUS
0
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
ANGELO
0
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
ESCALUS
0
I'll wait upon your honour.                    Exeunt
LUCIO
0
If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
Amen.
LUCIO
0
Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
'Thou shalt not steal'?
LUCIO
0
Ay, that he raz'd.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
I never heard any soldier dislike it.
LUCIO
0
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
No? A dozen times at least.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
What, in metre?
LUCIO
0
In any proportion or in any language.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
I think, or in any religion.
LUCIO
0
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
LUCIO
0
I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt
LUCIO
0
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
LUCIO
0
Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
To what, I pray?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Judge.
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
To three thousand dolours a year.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Ay, and more.
LUCIO
0
A French crown more.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
LUCIO
0
Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
How now! which of your hips has the most profound
MRS
0
OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Who's that, I pray thee?
MRS
0
OVERDONE. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him
LUCIO
0
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art
MRS
0
OVERDONE. I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam
LUCIO
0
Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.
LUCIO
0
Away; let's go learn the truth of it.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
POMPEY
0
Yonder man is carried to prison.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. Well, what has he done?
POMPEY
0
A woman.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. But what's his offence?
POMPEY
0
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. What! is there a maid with child by him?
POMPEY
0
No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not
MRS
0
OVERDONE. What proclamation, man?
POMPEY
0
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. And what shall become of those in the city?
POMPEY
0
They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that
MRS
0
OVERDONE. But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
POMPEY
0
To the ground, mistress.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
POMPEY
0
Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.
MRS
0
OVERDONE. What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.
POMPEY
0
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;
CLAUDIO
0
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
PROVOST
0
I do it not in evil disposition,
CLAUDIO
0
Thus can the demigod Authority
LUCIO
0
Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?
CLAUDIO
0
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;
LUCIO
0
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for
CLAUDIO
0
What but to speak of would offend again.
LUCIO
0
What, is't murder?
CLAUDIO
0
No.
LUCIO
0
Lechery?
CLAUDIO
0
Call it so.
PROVOST
0
Away, sir; you must go.
CLAUDIO
0
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
LUCIO
0
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd
CLAUDIO
0
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
LUCIO
0
With child, perhaps?
CLAUDIO
0
Unhappily, even so.
LUCIO
0
I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy
CLAUDIO
0
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
LUCIO
0
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like,
CLAUDIO
0
I thank you, good friend Lucio.
LUCIO
0
Within two hours.
CLAUDIO
0
Come, officer, away.                           Exeunt
DUKE
0
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
FRIAR
0
May your Grace speak of it?
DUKE
0
My holy sir, none better knows than you
FRIAR
0
Gladly, my lord.
DUKE
0
We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
FRIAR
0
It rested in your Grace
DUKE
0
I do fear, too dreadful.
ISABELLA
0
And have you nuns no farther privileges?
FRANCISCA
0
Are not these large enough?
ISABELLA
0
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,
LUCIO
0
[ Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!
ISABELLA
0
Who's that which calls?
FRANCISCA
0
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
ISABELLA
0
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?
LUCIO
0
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
ISABELLA
0
Why her 'unhappy brother'? Let me ask
LUCIO
0
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
ISABELLA
0
Woe me! For what?
LUCIO
0
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
ISABELLA
0
Sir, make me not your story.
LUCIO
0
It is true.
ISABELLA
0
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
LUCIO
0
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
ISABELLA
0
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
LUCIO
0
Is she your cousin?
ISABELLA
0
Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
LUCIO
0
She it is.
ISABELLA
0
O, let him marry her!
LUCIO
0
This is the point.
ISABELLA
0
Doth he so seek his life?
LUCIO
0
Has censur'd him
ISABELLA
0
Alas! what poor ability's in me
LUCIO
0
Assay the pow'r you have.
ISABELLA
0
My power, alas, I doubt!
LUCIO
0
Our doubts are traitors,
ISABELLA
0
I'll see what I can do.
LUCIO
0
But speedily.
ISABELLA
0
I will about it straight;
LUCIO
0
I take my leave of you.
ISABELLA
0
Good sir, adieu.                              Exeunt

Be it as your wisdom will.

Here, if it like your honour.

See that Claudio
ESCALUS
0
[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
ELBOW
0
Come, bring them away; if these be good people in a
ANGELO
0
How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the matter?
ELBOW
0
If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke's constable,
ANGELO
0
Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
ELBOW
0
If it please your honour, I know not well what they are; but
ESCALUS
0
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
ANGELO
0
Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why
POMPEY
0
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
ANGELO
0
What are you, sir?
ELBOW
0
He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad
ESCALUS
0
How know you that?
ELBOW
0
My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-
ESCALUS
0
How! thy wife!
ELBOW
0
Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-
ESCALUS
0
Dost thou detest her therefore?
ELBOW
0
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that
ESCALUS
0
How dost thou know that, constable?
ELBOW
0
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
ESCALUS
0
By the woman's means?
ELBOW
0
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in
POMPEY
0
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
ELBOW
0
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,
ESCALUS
0
Do you hear how he misplaces?
POMPEY
0
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your
ESCALUS
0
Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.
POMPEY
0
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the
FROTH
0
No, indeed.
POMPEY
0
Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking
FROTH
0
Ay, so I did indeed.
POMPEY
0
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
FROTH
0
All this is true.
POMPEY
0
Why, very well then-
ESCALUS
0
Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
POMPEY
0
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
ESCALUS
0
No, sir, nor I mean it not.
POMPEY
0
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
FROTH
0
All-hallond eve.
POMPEY
0
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
FROTH
0
I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.
POMPEY
0
Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.
ANGELO
0
This will last out a night in Russia,
ESCALUS
0
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
POMPEY
0
Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.
ELBOW
0
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
POMPEY
0
I beseech your honour, ask me.
ESCALUS
0
Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
POMPEY
0
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
ESCALUS
0
Ay, sir, very well.
POMPEY
0
Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
ESCALUS
0
Well, I do so.
POMPEY
0
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
ESCALUS
0
Why, no.
POMPEY
0
I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
ESCALUS
0
He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
ELBOW
0
First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
POMPEY
0
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
ELBOW
0
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
POMPEY
0
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
ESCALUS
0
Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
ELBOW
0
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
ESCALUS
0
If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
ELBOW
0
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
ESCALUS
0
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
ELBOW
0
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked
ESCALUS
0
Where were you born, friend?
FROTH
0
Here in Vienna, sir.
ESCALUS
0
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
FROTH
0
Yes, an't please you, sir.
ESCALUS
0
So. What trade are you of, sir?
POMPEY
0
A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
ESCALUS
0
Your mistress' name?
POMPEY
0
Mistress Overdone.
ESCALUS
0
Hath she had any more than one husband?
POMPEY
0
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
ESCALUS
0
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
FROTH
0
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into
ESCALUS
0
Well, no more of it, Master Froth; farewell. [Exit FROTH]
POMPEY
0
Pompey.
ESCALUS
0
What else?
POMPEY
0
Bum, sir.
ESCALUS
0
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
POMPEY
0
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
ESCALUS
0
How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
POMPEY
0
If the law would allow it, sir.
ESCALUS
0
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
POMPEY
0
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
ESCALUS
0
No, Pompey.
POMPEY
0
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
ESCALUS
0
There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
POMPEY
0
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
ESCALUS
0
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
POMPEY
0
I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I
ESCALUS
0
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
ELBOW
0
Seven year and a half, sir.
ESCALUS
0
I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
ELBOW
0
And a half, sir.
ESCALUS
0
Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
ELBOW
0
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
ESCALUS
0
Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
ELBOW
0
To your worship's house, sir?
ESCALUS
0
To my house. Fare you well.              [Exit ELBOW]
JUSTICE
0
Eleven, sir.
ESCALUS
0
I pray you home to dinner with me.
JUSTICE
0
I humbly thank you.
ESCALUS
0
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
JUSTICE
0
Lord Angelo is severe.
ESCALUS
0
It is but needful:
SERVANT
0
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
PROVOST
0
Pray you do. [Exit SERVANT] I'll know
ANGELO
0
Now, what's the matter, Provost?
PROVOST
0
Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?
ANGELO
0
Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
PROVOST
0
Lest I might be too rash;
ANGELO
0
Go to; let that be mine.
PROVOST
0
I crave your honour's pardon.
ANGELO
0
Dispose of her
ANGELO
1
SERVANT
Dispose of her
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
SERVANT
1
SERVANT
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
ANGELO
1
SERVANT
Hath he a sister?
PROVOST
1
SERVANT
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
ANGELO
0
Well, let her be admitted.                Exit SERVANT
PROVOST
0
[Going] Save your honour!
ANGELO
0
Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
ISABELLA
0
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
ANGELO
0
Well; what's your suit?
ISABELLA
0
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
ANGELO
0
Well; the matter?
ISABELLA
0
I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
PROVOST
0
[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
ANGELO
0
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
ISABELLA
0
O just but severe law!
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
ISABELLA
0
Must he needs die?
ANGELO
0
Maiden, no remedy.
ISABELLA
0
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
ANGELO
0
I will not do't.
ISABELLA
0
But can you, if you would?
ANGELO
0
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
ISABELLA
0
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
ANGELO
0
He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
ISABELLA
0
Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
ANGELO
0
Pray you be gone.
ISABELLA
0
I would to heaven I had your potency,
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
ANGELO
0
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
ISABELLA
0
Alas! Alas!
ANGELO
0
Be you content, fair maid.
ISABELLA
0
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
LUCIO
0
[Aside] Ay, well said.
ANGELO
0
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
ISABELLA
0
Yet show some pity.
ANGELO
0
I show it most of all when I show justice;
ISABELLA
0
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] That's well said.
ISABELLA
0
Could great men thunder
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
PROVOST
0
[Aside] Pray heaven she win him.
ISABELLA
0
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
ISABELLA
0
That in the captain's but a choleric word
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
ANGELO
0
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ISABELLA
0
Because authority, though it err like others,
ANGELO
0
[Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
ISABELLA
0
Gentle my lord, turn back.
ANGELO
0
I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
ISABELLA
0
Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
ANGELO
0
How, bribe me?
ISABELLA
0
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
ISABELLA
0
Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
ANGELO
0
Well; come to me to-morrow.
LUCIO
0
[To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
ISABELLA
0
Heaven keep your honour safe!
ANGELO
0
[Aside] Amen; for I
ISABELLA
0
At what hour to-morrow
ANGELO
0
At any time 'fore noon.
ISABELLA
0
Save your honour!              Exeunt all but ANGELO
ANGELO
0
From thee; even from thy virtue!
DUKE
0
Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
PROVOST
0
I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
DUKE
0
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
PROVOST
0
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
DUKE
0
When must he die?
PROVOST
0
As I do think, to-morrow.
DUKE
0
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
JULIET
0
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
DUKE
0
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
JULIET
0
I'll gladly learn.
DUKE
0
Love you the man that wrong'd you?
JULIET
0
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
DUKE
0
So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
JULIET
0
Mutually.
DUKE
0
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
JULIET
0
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
DUKE
0
'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
JULIET
0
I do repent me as it is an evil,
DUKE
0
There rest.
JULIET
0
Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
PROVOST
0
'Tis pity of him.                              Exeunt
ANGELO
0
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
SERVANT
0
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
ANGELO
0
Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
ISABELLA
0
I am come to know your pleasure.
ANGELO
0
That you might know it would much better please me
ISABELLA
0
Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
ANGELO
0
Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
ISABELLA
0
Under your sentence?
ANGELO
0
Yea.
ISABELLA
0
When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
ANGELO
0
Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
ISABELLA
0
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
ANGELO
0
Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
ISABELLA
0
Sir, believe this:
ANGELO
0
I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
ISABELLA
0
How say you?
ANGELO
0
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
ISABELLA
0
Please you to do't,
ANGELO
0
Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
ISABELLA
0
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
ANGELO
0
Nay, but hear me;
ISABELLA
0
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
ANGELO
0
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
ISABELLA
0
So.
ANGELO
0
And his offence is so, as it appears,
ISABELLA
0
True.
ANGELO
0
Admit no other way to save his life,
ISABELLA
0
As much for my poor brother as myself;
ANGELO
0
Then must your brother die.
ISABELLA
0
And 'twere the cheaper way:
ANGELO
0
Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
ISABELLA
0
Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
ANGELO
0
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
ISABELLA
0
O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
ANGELO
0
We are all frail.
ISABELLA
0
Else let my brother die,
ANGELO
0
Nay, women are frail too.
ISABELLA
0
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
ANGELO
0
I think it well;
ISABELLA
0
I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
ANGELO
0
Plainly conceive, I love you.
ISABELLA
0
My brother did love Juliet,
ANGELO
0
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
ISABELLA
0
I know your virtue hath a license in't,
ANGELO
0
Believe me, on mine honour,
ISABELLA
0
Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
ANGELO
0
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
ISABELLA
0
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
DUKE
0
So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
CLAUDIO
0
The miserable have no other medicine
DUKE
0
Be absolute for death; either death or life
CLAUDIO
0
I humbly thank you.
ISABELLA
0
[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
PROVOST
0
Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
DUKE
0
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
CLAUDIO
0
Most holy sir, I thank you.
ISABELLA
0
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
PROVOST
0
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
DUKE
0
Provost, a word with you.
PROVOST
0
As many as you please.
DUKE
0
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
CLAUDIO
0
Now, sister, what's the comfort?
ISABELLA
0
Why,
CLAUDIO
0
Is there no remedy?
ISABELLA
0
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
CLAUDIO
0
But is there any?
ISABELLA
0
Yes, brother, you may live:
CLAUDIO
0
Perpetual durance?
ISABELLA
0
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
CLAUDIO
0
But in what nature?
ISABELLA
0
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
CLAUDIO
0
Let me know the point.
ISABELLA
0
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
CLAUDIO
0
Why give you me this shame?
ISABELLA
0
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
CLAUDIO
0
The precise Angelo!
ISABELLA
0
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
CLAUDIO
0
O heavens! it cannot be.
ISABELLA
0
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
CLAUDIO
0
Thou shalt not do't.
ISABELLA
0
O, were it but my life!
CLAUDIO
0
Thanks, dear Isabel.
ISABELLA
0
Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
CLAUDIO
0
Yes. Has he affections in him
ISABELLA
0
Which is the least?
CLAUDIO
0
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
ISABELLA
0
What says my brother?
CLAUDIO
0
Death is a fearful thing.
ISABELLA
0
And shamed life a hateful.
CLAUDIO
0
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
ISABELLA
0
Alas, alas!
CLAUDIO
0
Sweet sister, let me live.
ISABELLA
0
O you beast!
CLAUDIO
0
Nay, hear me, Isabel.
ISABELLA
0
O fie, fie, fie!
CLAUDIO
1
DUKE
O, hear me, Isabella.
DUKE
1
DUKE
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
ISABELLA
1
DUKE
What is your will?
DUKE
1
DUKE
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out
DUKE
1
DUKE
Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
CLAUDIO
1
DUKE
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
DUKE
0
Hold you there. Farewell. [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with
DUKE
1
PROVOST
Hold you there. Farewell. [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with
    you.
PROVOST
1
PROVOST
What's your will, father?
DUKE
1
PROVOST
That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
PROVOST
0
In good time.                            Exit PROVOST
DUKE
0
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
ISABELLA
0
I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
DUKE
0
That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
ISABELLA
0
Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
DUKE
0
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
ISABELLA
0
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
DUKE
0
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
ISABELLA
0
Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
DUKE
0
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
ISABELLA
0
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
DUKE
0
It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
ISABELLA
0
Show me how, good father.
DUKE
0
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
ISABELLA
0
The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
DUKE
0
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
ISABELLA
0
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
ELBOW
0
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs
DUKE
0
O heavens! what stuff is here?
POMPEY
0
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest
ELBOW
0
Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
DUKE
0
And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
ELBOW
0
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
DUKE
0
Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
POMPEY
0
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
DUKE
0
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
ELBOW
0
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.
DUKE
0
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
ELBOW
0
His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
POMPEY
0
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
LUCIO
0
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
DUKE
0
Still thus, and thus; still worse!
LUCIO
0
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
POMPEY
0
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
LUCIO
0
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
POMPEY
0
Yes, faith, sir.
LUCIO
0
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
ELBOW
0
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
LUCIO
0
Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
POMPEY
0
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
LUCIO
0
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will
DUKE
0
And you.
LUCIO
0
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
ELBOW
0
Come your ways, sir; come.
POMPEY
0
You will not bail me then, sir?
LUCIO
0
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?
ELBOW
0
Come your ways, sir; come.
LUCIO
0
Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
DUKE
0
I know none. Can you tell me of any?
LUCIO
0
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
DUKE
0
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
LUCIO
0
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
DUKE
0
He does well in't.
LUCIO
0
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
DUKE
0
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
LUCIO
0
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
DUKE
0
How should he be made, then?
LUCIO
0
Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
DUKE
0
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
LUCIO
0
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
DUKE
0
I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
LUCIO
0
O, sir, you are deceiv'd.
DUKE
0
'Tis not possible.
LUCIO
0
Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
DUKE
0
You do him wrong, surely.
LUCIO
0
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
DUKE
0
What, I prithee, might be the cause?
LUCIO
0
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
DUKE
0
Wise? Why, no question but he was.
LUCIO
0
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
DUKE
0
Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
LUCIO
0
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
DUKE

Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me

O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes

Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
    Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
    He doth with holy abstinence subdue

O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes

    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the

For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

Not that I know.
DUKE

No? You say your husband.

Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,

This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
