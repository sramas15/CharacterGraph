Lady Macbeth
DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,

    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.

Messenger
Lady Macbeth
DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,

    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.

    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves

    Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,

    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note

OVOST. I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?

JULIET
OVOST. I would do more than that, if more were needful.
  DUKE.

  PROVOST.

JULIET
OVOST. As I do think, to-morrow.
  DUKE.

JULIET

  DUKE.

JULIET

  JULIET. 
1
JULIET
LIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  DUKE. 
1
JULIET
KE. So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
  JULIET. 
1
JULIET
LIET. Mutually.
  DUKE. 
1
JULIET
KE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
  JULIET. 
1
JULIET
LIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.
  DUKE.

JULIET

ANGELO
SERVANT
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
    Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
    'Tis not the devil's crest.
  SERVANT.

ANGELO
SERVANT
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO

ANGELO

ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO

ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,

ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO.

ANGELO

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. We are all frail.
  ISABELLA.

ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. I think it well;

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  ISABELLA. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
    Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit

ANGELO
DUKE

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

    profession; one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own
    house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master

    A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
    And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
    And let the subject see, to make them know
    That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
    Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,

DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"

    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.

    My father as he slept, I had done't.

    [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other
    devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in
    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason
    enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O,
    come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock!
    Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for
    stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may
    roast your goose. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at
    quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll

    But that myself should be the root and father
    Of many kings. If there come truth from them
    (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well
    And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.

    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

    All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And sundry blessings hang about his throne

    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,

    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,

3
LUCIO
ISABELLA
ELBOW
MPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.
  ESCALUS.

LUCIO
ISABELLA
ELBOW
CALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be

ANGELO
SERVANT
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
    Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
    'Tis not the devil's crest.
  SERVANT.

ANGELO
SERVANT
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
    Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit

    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great

    I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
    Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
    Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
    I am combined by a sacred vow,
    And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.

    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had

    The matter being afoot, keep your instruction
    And hold you ever to our special drift;
    Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
    As cause doth minister. Go, call at Flavius' house,
    And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
    And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;

    To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
    When it deserves, with characters of brass,
    A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
    And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
    And let the subject see, to make them know
    That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
    Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
    You must walk by us on our other hand,
    And good supporters are you.

  LADY 
0
DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"

    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
    The air is delicate.

0
CBETH. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.
  LADY 
0
DY MACBETH. He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?
  MACBETH.

    My father as he slept, I had done't.

    Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub? Here's
    a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty. Come
    in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat fort.
    [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other
    devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in
    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason
    enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O,
    come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock!
    Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for
    stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may
    roast your goose. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at
    quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll
    devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of
    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting
    bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the

    It should not stand in thy posterity,
    But that myself should be the root and father
    Of many kings. If there come truth from them
    (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well
    And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.

CBETH. Bring them before us.                 Exit Attendant.
    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
    All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And sundry blessings hang about his throne
    That speak him full of grace.

    I have lived long enough. My way of life
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but in their stead,
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.

    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time;
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
SERVANT
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
    Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
    'Tis not the devil's crest.
  SERVANT.

ANGELO
SERVANT
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
  ANGELO. 
1
ANGELO
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO.

ANGELO

  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Yea.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Sir, believe this:
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. We are all frail.
  ISABELLA.

ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  ISABELLA. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
    Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit

  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO

ABELLA. Why,

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Which is the least?

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. What says my brother?
  CLAUDIO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO

3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
  DUKE. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
KE. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
  ISABELLA. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
KE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his

3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
  DUKE. 
3
ANGELO

3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

3
ANGELO

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
KE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
CIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the

4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
KE. He does well in't.
  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
  DUKE. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
KE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
CIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
  DUKE. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

KE. How should he be made, then?
  LUCIO.

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

CIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
KE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?
  LUCIO.

ANGELO
DUKE

CIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth

4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
KE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.
  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
CIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
  DUKE.

ANGELO
DUKE

    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
    traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
    forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the

GELO. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
  ESCALUS. 
1
ANGELO
CALUS. I guess not.
  ANGELO. 
1
ANGELO
GELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
  ESCALUS. 
1
ANGELO
CALUS. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of

    The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
    The matter being afoot, keep your instruction
    And hold you ever to our special drift;
    Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
    As cause doth minister. Go, call at Flavius' house,
    And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
    And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
    But send me Flavius first.

  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
PETER
FRIAR
KE. O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
    To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
    When it deserves, with characters of brass,
    A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
    And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
    And let the subject see, to make them know
    That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
    Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
    You must walk by us on our other hand,
    And good supporters are you.
  PETER.

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR

  ANGELO.

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR

  DUKE. 
3
DUKE
PETER

DUKE
PETER

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR

DUKE

  LADY 
0
DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"

    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
    The air is delicate.

0
CBETH. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.
  LADY 
0
DY MACBETH. He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?
  MACBETH.

CBETH. Hath he ask'd for me?

    My father as he slept, I had done't.

0
CBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance,
    I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant
    There's nothing serious in mortality.
    All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vault to brag of.

    Thou play'dst most foully for't; yet it was said
    It should not stand in thy posterity,
    But that myself should be the root and father
    Of many kings. If there come truth from them
    (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well
    And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.
  MACBETH.

  MACBETH.

  BANQUO.

  MACBETH. 
0
CBETH. Bring them before us.                 Exit Attendant.
    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?
  FIRST

RST MURTHERER. It was, so please your Highness.
  MACBETH.

    A most miraculous work in this good King,
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
    All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And sundry blessings hang about his throne
    That speak him full of grace.

    I have lived long enough. My way of life
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but in their stead,
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.

    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
    Cannot once start me.

    There would have been a time for such a word.
    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time;
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.

    If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine,

    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
    Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,
    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
    Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!

ANGELO
SERVANT
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
    Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
    'Tis not the devil's crest.
  SERVANT.

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;

ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO

  ISABELLA. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
    Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit

3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE.

ANGELO
DUKE

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
KE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;

4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

  LUCIO. 
4
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
CIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
  DUKE.

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

    house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
    traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
    forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR
ABELLA. O that it were as like as it is true!

  ISABELLA. 
3
DUKE
PETER
FRIAR
ABELLA. And is this all?

DUKE
PETER

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR
ABELLA. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

  LADY 
0
DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"

    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.

0
CBETH. Bring them before us.                 Exit Attendant.
    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,

    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:

    I have lived long enough. My way of life
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but in their stead,
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.

    As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
    Cannot once start me.

    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time;
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.

    Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,
    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note

ANCISCA. It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
    Turn you the key, and know his business of him:
    You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn;
    When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
    But in the presence of the prioress;
    Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
    Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
    He calls again; I pray you answer him.        Exit FRANCISCA

ANGELO
PROVOST

  PROVOST.

ANGELO
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
SERVANT
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
    Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
    'Tis not the devil's crest.
  SERVANT. 
2
ANGELO
SERVANT
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
  ANGELO. 
1
ANGELO
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Yea.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO

ABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Sir, believe this:
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO.

ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. We are all frail.

ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, women are frail too.

ANGELO
ISABELLA

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Believe me, on mine honour,

ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  ISABELLA. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
    Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit

POMPEY
ABHORSON
MPEY. I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of
    profession; one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own
    house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
    traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
    forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the
    Lord's sake.'

    Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
    Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
    I am combined by a sacred vow,

    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the

DY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
    To cry, "Hold, hold!"
  MACBETH.

CBETH. My dearest love,

DY MACBETH. And when goes hence?
  MACBETH.

0
NQUO. This guest of summer,
    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
    The air is delicate.

  MACBETH. 
0
CBETH. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.
  LADY 
0
DY MACBETH. He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?
  MACBETH. 
0
CBETH. Hath he ask'd for me?
  LADY

    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
    Gives way to in repose!

  LADY

DY MACBETH. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked
    And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
    Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
    He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
    My father as he slept, I had done't.
  MACBETH. 
0
CBETH. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
  LADY

DY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.

CBETH. There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried,
  LADY

DY MACBETH. There are two lodged together.
  MACBETH. 
0
CBETH. One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other,
  LADY

DY MACBETH. Consider it not so deeply.
  MACBETH.

CBETH. But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
  LADY

DY MACBETH. These deeds must not be thought
  MACBETH.

  LADY

  MACBETH.

    How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
    What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!
    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.

    Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub? Here's
    a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty. Come
    in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat fort.
    [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other
    devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in
    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason
    enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O,
    come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock!
    Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for
    stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may
    roast your goose. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at
    quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll
    devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of
    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting
    bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the

    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,

    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;

    To the last syllable of recorded time;
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale

3
LUCIO
ISABELLA
ELBOW
MPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
3
LUCIO
ISABELLA
ELBOW
CALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
  POMPEY. 
3
LUCIO
ISABELLA
ELBOW
MPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
  ESCALUS.

    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.

    'Tis not the devil's crest.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive; and even so
    The general subject to a well-wish'd king
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins

ANGELO
ISABELLA

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good

GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO.

ANGELO
ISABELLA

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;

ANGELO
ISABELLA

  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA

2
ANGELO

ISABELLA
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,

ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA.

ANGELO
ISABELLA

2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  ISABELLA. 
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
    Either of condemnation or approof,
    Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
    Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit

ANGELO
DUKE

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA

CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;

    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
    traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
    forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the

    'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
    Say, by this token, I desire his company
    At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
    I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
    Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
    Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
    I am combined by a sacred vow,
    And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
    Command these fretting waters from your eyes
    With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
    If I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCIO
POMPEY
PROVOST
CIO. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
    so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had
    lived.                                         Exit ISABELLA

    The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
    The matter being afoot, keep your instruction
    And hold you ever to our special drift;
    Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
    As cause doth minister. Go, call at Flavius' house,
    And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
    And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
    But send me Flavius first.

DUKE
PETER
FRIAR
KE. O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
    To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
    When it deserves, with characters of brass,
    A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
    And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
    And let the subject see, to make them know
    That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
    Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
    You must walk by us on our other hand,
    And good supporters are you.

0
MPEY. Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Why, no.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I

0
CALUS. If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that

CALUS. Where were you born, friend?

0
CALUS. So. What trade are you of, sir?
  POMPEY.

MPEY. A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Your mistress' name?
  POMPEY.

0
CALUS. Hath she had any more than one husband?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

CALUS. What else?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Bum, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. No, Pompey.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If

CALUS. I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. And a half, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
  ELBOW.

CALUS. I pray you home to dinner with me.
  JUSTICE. 
0
STICE. I humbly thank you.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
  JUSTICE. 
0
STICE. Lord Angelo is severe.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. It is but needful:
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Pray you do. [Exit SERVANT] I'll know
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Now, what's the matter, Provost?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Lest I might be too rash;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Go to; let that be mine.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I crave your honour's pardon.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Dispose of her
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Hath he a sister?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well, let her be admitted.                Exit SERVANT
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Going] Save your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; what's your suit?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. There is a vice that most I do abhor,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; the matter?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O just but severe law!
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Must he needs die?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Maiden, no remedy.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I will not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. But can you, if you would?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pray you be gone.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I would to heaven I had your potency,
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Alas! Alas!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Be you content, fair maid.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [Aside] Ay, well said.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yet show some pity.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] That's well said.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Could great men thunder
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Aside] Pray heaven she win him.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That in the captain's but a choleric word
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Because authority, though it err like others,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Gentle my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. How, bribe me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; come to me to-morrow.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Heaven keep your honour safe!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. [Aside] Amen; for I
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. At what hour to-morrow
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. At any time 'fore noon.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Save your honour!              Exeunt all but ANGELO
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. From thee; even from thy virtue!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bound by my charity and my blest order,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I would do more than that, if more were needful.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. When must he die?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As I do think, to-morrow.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I'll gladly learn.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Love you the man that wrong'd you?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Mutually.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. 'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do repent me as it is an evil,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There rest.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. 'Tis pity of him.                              Exeunt
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. That you might know it would much better please me
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Under your sentence?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yea.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Sir, believe this:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. We are all frail.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Else let my brother die,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, women are frail too.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I think it well;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Believe me, on mine honour,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be absolute for death; either death or life
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. I humbly thank you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Most holy sir, I thank you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. My business is a word or two with Claudio.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Provost, a word with you.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As many as you please.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Now, sister, what's the comfort?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Why,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Is there no remedy?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But is there any?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Perpetual durance?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But in what nature?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to't,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Let me know the point.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Why give you me this shame?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. There spake my brother; there my father's grave
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. The precise Angelo!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. O heavens! it cannot be.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thou shalt not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, were it but my life!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Which is the least?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. What says my brother?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Alas, alas!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Sweet sister, let me live.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O you beast!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Nay, hear me, Isabel.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O fie, fie, fie!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. O, hear me, Isabella.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. What is your will?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Hold you there. Farewell. [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. What's your will, father?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. In good time.                            Exit PROVOST
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
  DUKE. 
0
KE. That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
  DUKE. 
0
KE. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
  DUKE. 
0
KE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Show me how, good father.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
  DUKE. 
0
KE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs
  DUKE. 
0
KE. O heavens! what stuff is here?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. 'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. That we were all, as some would seem to be,
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Still thus, and thus; still worse!
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Yes, faith, sir.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a

MPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

BOW. Come your ways, sir; come.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I know none. Can you tell me of any?
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
  DUKE. 
0
KE. He does well in't.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is

CIO. Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
  DUKE. 
0
KE. You do him wrong, surely.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and

KE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

CALUS. One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to
  DUKE. 
0
KE. What pleasure was he given to?
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
  DUKE.

OVOST. His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,

OVOST. Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
  DUKE.

OVOST. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a

  PROVOST.

CIO. As any in Vienna, on my word.
  ESCALUS.

CIO. Not better than he, by her own report.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Say you?
  LUCIO.

CALUS. I will go darkly to work with her.
  LUCIO.

CALUS. Come on, mistress; here's a gentlewoman denies all that

CALUS. In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon

CIO. Mum.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. How! Know you where you are?
  DUKE. 
0

  LUCIO.

CIO. 'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, good-man bald-pate.
  DUKE.

  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Most notedly, sir.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and

0
KE. I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.
  ANGELO.

GELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal. Away with him to

KE. Stay, sir; stay awhile.
  ANGELO.

GELO. What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
  LUCIO.

CIO. This may prove worse than hanging.

ABELLA. I do, my lord.

  MARIANA.

RIANA. O my dear lord,

  MARIANA.

RIANA. Gentle my liege-                           [Kneeling]
  DUKE. 
0
KE. You do but lose your labour.
  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Against all sense you do importune her.
  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. Isabel,
  DUKE. 
0

  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. [Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,

RIANA. Merely, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. It was commanded so.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Had you a special warrant for the deed?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. No, my good lord; it was by private message.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. For which I do discharge you of your office;
  PROVOST.

OVOST. Pardon me, noble lord;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. What's he?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. His name is Barnardine.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I am sorry one so learned and so wise
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Which is that Barnardine?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. This, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There was a friar told me of this man.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. This is another prisoner that I sav'd,
  DUKE.

KE. [To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
  LUCIO.

CIO. Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping,

    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

0
GELO. What are you, sir?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. How know you that?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. How! thy wife!
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Dost thou detest her therefore?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. How dost thou know that, constable?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. By the woman's means?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Do you hear how he misplaces?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. No, indeed.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. Ay, so I did indeed.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. All this is true.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Why, very well then-
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. No, sir, nor I mean it not.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. All-hallond eve.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. This will last out a night in Russia,
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I beseech your honour, ask me.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Ay, sir, very well.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Well, I do so.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Why, no.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Where were you born, friend?
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. Here in Vienna, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. Yes, an't please you, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. So. What trade are you of, sir?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Your mistress' name?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Mistress Overdone.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Hath she had any more than one husband?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Well, no more of it, Master Froth; farewell. [Exit FROTH]
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Pompey.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. What else?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Bum, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. No, Pompey.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I

0
CALUS. Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Seven year and a half, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. And a half, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. To your worship's house, sir?
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. To my house. Fare you well.              [Exit ELBOW]
  JUSTICE.

STICE. Eleven, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I pray you home to dinner with me.
  JUSTICE. 
0
STICE. I humbly thank you.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
  JUSTICE. 
0
STICE. Lord Angelo is severe.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. It is but needful:
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Pray you do. [Exit SERVANT] I'll know
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Now, what's the matter, Provost?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Lest I might be too rash;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Go to; let that be mine.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I crave your honour's pardon.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Dispose of her
  ANGELO. 
1
SERVANT
GELO. Dispose of her
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
  SERVANT. 
1
SERVANT
RVANT. Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
  ANGELO. 
1
SERVANT
GELO. Hath he a sister?
  PROVOST. 
1
SERVANT
OVOST. Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well, let her be admitted.                Exit SERVANT
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Going] Save your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; what's your suit?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. There is a vice that most I do abhor,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; the matter?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O just but severe law!
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Must he needs die?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Maiden, no remedy.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I will not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. But can you, if you would?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pray you be gone.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I would to heaven I had your potency,
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Alas! Alas!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Be you content, fair maid.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [Aside] Ay, well said.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yet show some pity.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] That's well said.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Could great men thunder
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Aside] Pray heaven she win him.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That in the captain's but a choleric word
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Because authority, though it err like others,
  ANGELO.

GELO. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Gentle my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. How, bribe me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; come to me to-morrow.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. Heaven keep your honour safe!
  ANGELO.

ABELLA. At what hour to-morrow

0
GELO. At any time 'fore noon.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. Save your honour!              Exeunt all but ANGELO
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. From thee; even from thy virtue!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bound by my charity and my blest order,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I would do more than that, if more were needful.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. When must he die?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As I do think, to-morrow.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I'll gladly learn.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Love you the man that wrong'd you?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Mutually.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. 'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do repent me as it is an evil,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There rest.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. 'Tis pity of him.                              Exeunt
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. That you might know it would much better please me
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Under your sentence?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yea.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Sir, believe this:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. We are all frail.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Else let my brother die,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, women are frail too.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I think it well;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Believe me, on mine honour,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be absolute for death; either death or life
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. I humbly thank you.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
  PROVOST.

  DUKE.

KE. Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  CLAUDIO.

OVOST. And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Provost, a word with you.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As many as you please.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Now, sister, what's the comfort?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Why,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Is there no remedy?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But is there any?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Perpetual durance?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But in what nature?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to't,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Let me know the point.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. Why give you me this shame?
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. There spake my brother; there my father's grave
  CLAUDIO.

  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. O heavens! it cannot be.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thou shalt not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, were it but my life!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Which is the least?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. What says my brother?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
  ISABELLA.

  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
  ISABELLA. 
1

  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Show me how, good father.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

DUKE
MPEY. 'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.
  DUKE.

DUKE
KE. That we were all, as some would seem to be,
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Still thus, and thus; still worse!
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Yes, faith, sir.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. And you.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. Come your ways, sir; come.
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. You will not bail me then, sir?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. Come your ways, sir; come.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
  LUCIO.

  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I know none. Can you tell me of any?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. He does well in't.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. How should he be made, then?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. O, sir, you are deceiv'd.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. 'Tis not possible.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. You do him wrong, surely.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Come, sir, I know what I know.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. I fear you not.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no

1
DUKE
KE. What pleasure was he given to?
  ESCALUS. 
1
DUKE
CALUS. Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at

1
DUKE
KE. He professes to have received no sinister measure from his

    Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
    He doth with holy abstinence subdue
    That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
    To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that

  DUKE.

OVOST. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a

ABELLA. Ho, by your leave!
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
  ISABELLA. 
1
PROVOST
ABELLA. The better, given me by so holy a man.
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world.
  ISABELLA. 
1
PROVOST
ABELLA. Nay, but it is not so.
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. It is no other.
  ISABELLA. 
1
PROVOST
ABELLA. O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. You shall not be admitted to his sight.
  ISABELLA.

PROVOST
ABELLA. Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!

PROVOST
CIO. Good even. Friar, where's the Provost?
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Not within, sir.
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
    so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had
    lived.                                         Exit ISABELLA
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Did you such a thing?

PROVOST

GELO. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much

0
CALUS. I guess not.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
  ANGELO.

KE. My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
  ANGELO,

GELO, ESCALUS. Happy return be to your royal Grace!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Many and hearty thankings to you both.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. You make my bonds still greater.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
  PETER. 
0
TER. Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O worthy Duke,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. By course of justice!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Nay, it is ten times strange.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. That's he, indeed.
  DUKE.

KE. You were not bid to speak.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. No, my good lord;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I wish you now, then;
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. I warrant your honour.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.

ABELLA. Pardon it;

  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. In brief- to set the needless process by,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. This is most likely!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O that it were as like as it is true!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And is this all?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
  DUKE.

KE. A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar.
  DUKE.

KE. Words against me? This's a good friar, belike!

  DUKE.

KE. We did believe no less.
  PETER. 
0
TER. I know him for a man divine and holy;

RIANA. No, my lord.

RIANA. No, my lord.
  DUKE.

KE. A widow, then?
  MARIANA.

RIANA. Neither, my lord.
  DUKE.

  DUKE.

  LUCIO.

  MARIANA.

RIANA. Not that I know.
  DUKE.

  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
  MARIANA.

RIANA. My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  DUKE.

  LUCIO.

CIO. Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would
    sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.

CALUS. I will go darkly to work with her.
  LUCIO.

CIO. That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

CALUS. In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon

CIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?

    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

SEYTON
CBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
    Cannot once start me.

ABELLA. Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. How, bribe me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
  ANGELO.

GELO. Well; come to me to-morrow.
  LUCIO.

GELO. From thee; even from thy virtue!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bound by my charity and my blest order,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I would do more than that, if more were needful.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. When must he die?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As I do think, to-morrow.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I'll gladly learn.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Love you the man that wrong'd you?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Mutually.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. 'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do repent me as it is an evil,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There rest.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,

OVOST. 'Tis pity of him.                              Exeunt
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. That you might know it would much better please me
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Under your sentence?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yea.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Sir, believe this:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. We are all frail.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Else let my brother die,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, women are frail too.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I think it well;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Believe me, on mine honour,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
  CLAUDIO.

  PROVOST.

OVOST. Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
  DUKE.

KE. Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. Most holy sir, I thank you.
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. My business is a word or two with Claudio.
  PROVOST.

OVOST. And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Provost, a word with you.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As many as you please.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Now, sister, what's the comfort?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Why,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Is there no remedy?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But is there any?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Perpetual durance?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But in what nature?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to't,
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. Let me know the point.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. Why give you me this shame?
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. There spake my brother; there my father's grave

AUDIO. The precise Angelo!
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. O heavens! it cannot be.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. Thou shalt not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, were it but my life!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him
  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. Which is the least?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. What says my brother?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;

DUKE
ABELLA. What is your will?
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out

1
DUKE
KE. Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your

1

  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Show me how, good father.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to

DUKE
BOW. Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
  DUKE.

DUKE
KE. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.

DUKE
BOW. His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Still thus, and thus; still worse!
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Yes, faith, sir.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
  LUCIO.

DUKE
CIO. No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will

  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. You will not bail me then, sir?
  LUCIO.

DUKE
BOW. Come your ways, sir; come.

1
DUKE
KE. I know none. Can you tell me of any?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. He does well in't.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. How should he be made, then?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. O, sir, you are deceiv'd.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. 'Tis not possible.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. You do him wrong, surely.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him.

KE. Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
  LUCIO.

DUKE
CIO. Come, sir, I know what I know.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.

1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
  DUKE.

DUKE
KE. He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
  LUCIO.

DUKE
CIO. I fear you not.
  DUKE.

KE. O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me

DUKE
CALUS. One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to

1
DUKE
KE. What pleasure was he given to?
  ESCALUS. 
1
DUKE
CALUS. Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at

1
DUKE
KE. He professes to have received no sinister measure from his
  ESCALUS.

DUKE
CALUS. You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner

    little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it
    be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough; so
    every true man's apparel fits your thief.

  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
    Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
    He doth with holy abstinence subdue
    That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
    To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that
    Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
    But this being so, he's just. [Knocking within] Now are they

  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him

1
PROVOST
OVOST. His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,

1
PROVOST
KE. It is now apparent?
  PROVOST. 
1
PROVOST
OVOST. Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to
  PROVOST. 
1
PROVOST
OVOST. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. He wants advice.
  PROVOST. 
1
PROVOST
OVOST. He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the
  DUKE.

PROVOST
OVOST. Pray, sir, in what?
  DUKE.

PROVOST
OVOST. To him and to his substitutes.
  DUKE.

KE. You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch

    so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had

  MACDUFF.

    To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?

OTH. All this is true.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Why, very well then-
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. No, sir, nor I mean it not.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
  FROTH.

OTH. All-hallond eve.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
  FROTH.

OTH. I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.
  POMPEY.

  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. This will last out a night in Russia,
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I beseech your honour, ask me.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Ay, sir, very well.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Well, I do so.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Why, no.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Where were you born, friend?
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. Here in Vienna, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. Yes, an't please you, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. So. What trade are you of, sir?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Your mistress' name?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Mistress Overdone.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Hath she had any more than one husband?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
  FROTH. 
0
OTH. I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into

CALUS. Well, no more of it, Master Froth; farewell. [Exit FROTH]
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Pompey.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. What else?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Bum, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. No, Pompey.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I

0
CALUS. Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Seven year and a half, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. And a half, sir.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
  ELBOW. 
0
BOW. To your worship's house, sir?

  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I pray you home to dinner with me.
  JUSTICE. 
0
STICE. I humbly thank you.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
  JUSTICE. 
0
STICE. Lord Angelo is severe.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. It is but needful:
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Pray you do. [Exit SERVANT] I'll know
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Now, what's the matter, Provost?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Lest I might be too rash;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Go to; let that be mine.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I crave your honour's pardon.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Dispose of her
  ANGELO. 
1
SERVANT
GELO. Dispose of her
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
  SERVANT. 
1
SERVANT
RVANT. Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
  ANGELO. 
1
SERVANT
GELO. Hath he a sister?
  PROVOST. 
1
SERVANT
OVOST. Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well, let her be admitted.                Exit SERVANT
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Going] Save your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; what's your suit?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. There is a vice that most I do abhor,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; the matter?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O just but severe law!
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Must he needs die?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Maiden, no remedy.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I will not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. But can you, if you would?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pray you be gone.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I would to heaven I had your potency,
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Alas! Alas!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Be you content, fair maid.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [Aside] Ay, well said.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yet show some pity.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] That's well said.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Could great men thunder
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. [Aside] Pray heaven she win him.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That in the captain's but a choleric word
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Because authority, though it err like others,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Gentle my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. How, bribe me?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well; come to me to-morrow.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. [To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Heaven keep your honour safe!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. [Aside] Amen; for I
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. At what hour to-morrow
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. At any time 'fore noon.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Save your honour!              Exeunt all but ANGELO
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. From thee; even from thy virtue!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bound by my charity and my blest order,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. I would do more than that, if more were needful.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. When must he die?
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As I do think, to-morrow.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I'll gladly learn.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Love you the man that wrong'd you?
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Mutually.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. 'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. I do repent me as it is an evil,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There rest.
  JULIET. 
0
LIET. Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. 'Tis pity of him.                              Exeunt
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. That you might know it would much better please me
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Under your sentence?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Yea.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Sir, believe this:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. How say you?
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Please you to do't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, but hear me;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. So.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. True.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Then must your brother die.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And 'twere the cheaper way:
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. We are all frail.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Else let my brother die,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Nay, women are frail too.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. I think it well;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in't,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Believe me, on mine honour,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be absolute for death; either death or life
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. I humbly thank you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Most holy sir, I thank you.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. My business is a word or two with Claudio.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Provost, a word with you.
  PROVOST. 
0
OVOST. As many as you please.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Now, sister, what's the comfort?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Why,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Is there no remedy?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But is there any?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Perpetual durance?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. But in what nature?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to't,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Let me know the point.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Why give you me this shame?
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. There spake my brother; there my father's grave
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. The precise Angelo!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. O heavens! it cannot be.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thou shalt not do't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O, were it but my life!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Which is the least?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. What says my brother?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Alas, alas!
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Sweet sister, let me live.
  ISABELLA.

1
DUKE
KE. Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. What is your will?
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
  CLAUDIO. 
1
DUKE
AUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Hold you there. Farewell. [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with

DUKE
PROVOST
KE. Hold you there. Farewell. [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with
    you.

  DUKE. 
2
DUKE
PROVOST
KE. That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
  PROVOST. 
1
DUKE
OVOST. In good time.                            Exit PROVOST
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. Show me how, good father.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
  ISABELLA. 
1
DUKE
ABELLA. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE

DUKE
BOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him

1
DUKE
KE. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
  DUKE.

DUKE
KE. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,

1
DUKE
BOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.

1
DUKE
BOW. His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Still thus, and thus; still worse!
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. Yes, faith, sir.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
  ELBOW. 
1
DUKE
BOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a

1
DUKE
MPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

  POMPEY. 
1
DUKE
MPEY. You will not bail me then, sir?

1
DUKE
KE. I know none. Can you tell me of any?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. He does well in't.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. How should he be made, then?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot

1
DUKE
KE. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion

1
DUKE
KE. I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was

DUKE
CIO. O, sir, you are deceiv'd.

CIO. Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. You do him wrong, surely.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him.
  DUKE.

DUKE
KE. Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Come, sir, I know what I know.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
  LUCIO. 
1
DUKE
CIO. I fear you not.
  DUKE. 
1
DUKE
KE. O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me
  LUCIO.

1
DUKE
KE. What pleasure was he given to?
  ESCALUS. 
1
DUKE
CALUS. Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at

DUKE
KE. He professes to have received no sinister measure from his

    Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
    He doth with holy abstinence subdue
    That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r

PROVOST
CIO. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
    so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had
    lived.                                         Exit ISABELLA

  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
  DUKE. 
1
PROVOST
KE. Did you such a thing?
  LUCIO. 
1
PROVOST
CIO. Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would

  ANGELO.

GELO. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I guess not.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaim'd;
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I shall, sir; fare you well.

RIANA. I would Friar Peter-

ABELLA. O, peace! the friar is come.
  PETER.

  DUKE. 
0
KE. My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
  ANGELO, 
0
GELO, ESCALUS. Happy return be to your royal Grace!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Many and hearty thankings to you both.
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. You make my bonds still greater.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
  PETER. 
0
TER. Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O worthy Duke,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. By course of justice!
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Nay, it is ten times strange.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. It is not truer he is Angelo
  DUKE.

KE. Away with her. Poor soul,

  ISABELLA.

ABELLA. That's he, indeed.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. You were not bid to speak.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. No, my good lord;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I wish you now, then;
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. I warrant your honour.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.
  LUCIO.

  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. Pardon it;

0
KE. Mended again. The matter- proceed.
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. In brief- to set the needless process by,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. This is most likely!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. O that it were as like as it is true!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. And is this all?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
  ISABELLA. 
0
ABELLA. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Words against me? This's a good friar, belike!
  LUCIO.

CIO. But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
  PETER.

TER. Blessed be your royal Grace!
  DUKE. 
0
KE. We did believe no less.
  PETER. 
0
TER. I know him for a man divine and holy;
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. My lord, most villainously; believe it.
  PETER.

  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. No, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Are you a maid?
  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. No, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. A widow, then?
  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. Neither, my lord.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife.

CIO. My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither

  LUCIO.

CIO. Well, my lord.
  MARIANA.

  DUKE. 
0
KE. For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Well, my lord.
  DUKE.

  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. Not that I know.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. No? You say your husband.
  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
  ANGELO. 
0
GELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
  MARIANA. 
0
RIANA. My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Know you this woman?
  LUCIO.

CIO. Carnally, she says.
  DUKE.

KE. Sirrah, no more.

CIO. As any in Vienna, on my word.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with
  LUCIO.

CIO. Not better than he, by her own report.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Say you?
  LUCIO.

CIO. Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would

0
CIO. Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would
    sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. I will go darkly to work with her.
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. Come on, mistress; here's a gentlewoman denies all that
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the
  ESCALUS. 
0
CALUS. In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon
  LUCIO. 
0
CIO. Mum.
  ESCALUS.

  DUKE. 
0
KE. 'Tis false.
  ESCALUS.

CALUS. How! Know you where you are?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Respect to your great place! and let the devil

CIO. 'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, good-man bald-pate.

CIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?

KE. Most notedly, sir.

GELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable

CALUS. Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal. Away with him to

KE. Stay, sir; stay awhile.
