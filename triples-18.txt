FIRST WITCH
-1
When shall we three meet again?
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

SECOND WITCH
-1
When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

THIRD WITCH
-1
That will be ere the set of sun.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Where the place?

SECOND WITCH
-1
Upon the heath.

THIRD WITCH
-1
There to meet with Macbeth.

FIRST WITCH
-1
I come, Graymalkin.

ALL
-1
Paddock calls. Anon!
    Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
    Hover through the fog and filthy air.                Exeunt.

DUNCAN
-1
What bloody man is that? He can report,
    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
    The newest state.

MALCOLM
-1
This is the sergeant
    Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
    'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
    Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
    As thou didst leave it.

SERGEANT
-1
Doubtful it stood,
    As two spent swimmers that do cling together
    And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-
    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
    The multiplying villainies of nature
    Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles
    Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
    And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
    Show'd like a rebel's whore. But all's too weak;
    For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name-
    Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
    Which smoked with bloody execution,
    Like Valor's minion carved out his passage
    Till he faced the slave,
    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
    Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
    And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN
-1
O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!

SERGEANT
-1
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
    Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
    So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
    Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark.
    No sooner justice had, with valor arm'd,
    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
    But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
    With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,
    Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN
-1
Dismay'd not this
    Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo.?

SERGEANT
-1
Yes,
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
    If I say sooth, I must report they were
    As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
    So they
    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
    Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
    Or memorize another Golgotha,
    I cannot tell-
    But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN
-1
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
    They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons.

LENNOX
-1
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
    That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS
-1
God save the King!

DUNCAN
-1
Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?

ROSS
-1
From Fife, great King,
    Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
    And fan our people cold.
    Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
    The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
    Confronted him with self-comparisons,
    Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,
    Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,
    The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN
-1
Great happiness!

ROSS
-1
That now
    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
    Nor would we deign him burial of his men
    Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN
-1
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
    Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
    And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS
-1
I'll see it done.

DUNCAN
-1
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
                                                         Exeunt.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Where hast thou been, sister?

SECOND WITCH
-1
Killing swine.

THIRD WITCH
-1
Sister, where thou?

FIRST WITCH
-1
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
    And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd. "Give me," quoth I.
    "Aroint thee, witch!" the rump-fed ronyon cries.
    Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;
    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

SECOND WITCH
-1
I'll give thee a wind.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Thou'rt kind.

THIRD WITCH
-1
And I another.

FIRST WITCH
-1
I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the quarters that they know
    I' the shipman's card.
    I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his penthouse lid;
    He shall live a man forbid.
    Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;
    Though his bark cannot be lost,
    Yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.
    Look what I have.

SECOND WITCH
-1
Show me, show me.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.                Drum within.

THIRD WITCH
-1
A drum, a drum!
    Macbeth doth come.

ALL
-1
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
    Posters of the sea and land,
    Thus do go about, about,
    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
    And thrice again, to make up nine.
    Peace! The charm's wound up.
                 Enter Macbeth and Banquo.

MACBETH
-1
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO
-1
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
    That man may question? You seem to understand me,
    By each at once her choppy finger laying
    Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
    That you are so.

MACBETH
-1
Speak, if you can. What are you?

FIRST WITCH
-1
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!

SECOND WITCH
-1
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!

THIRD WITCH
-1
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!

BANQUO
-1
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
    Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
    Are ye fantastical or that indeed
    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
    You greet with present grace and great prediction
    Of noble having and of royal hope,
    That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not,
    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
    Your favors nor your hate.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Hail!

SECOND WITCH
-1
Hail!

THIRD WITCH
-1
Hail!

FIRST WITCH
-1
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

SECOND WITCH
-1
Not so happy, yet much happier.

THIRD WITCH
-1
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

FIRST WITCH
-1
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

MACBETH
-1
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
    By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
    But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,
    A prosperous gentleman; and to be King
    Stands not within the prospect of belief,
    No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
    You owe this strange intelligence, or why
    Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
    With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
                                                 Witches vanish.

BANQUO
-1
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
    And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

MACBETH
-1
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted
    As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!

BANQUO
-1
Were such things here as we do speak about?
    Or have we eaten on the insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH
-1
Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO
-1
You shall be King.

MACBETH
-1
And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?

BANQUO
-1
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
                Enter Ross and Angus.

ROSS
-1
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
    The news of thy success; and when he reads
    Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
    His wonders and his praises do contend
    Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,
    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
    Strange images of death. As thick as hail
    Came post with post, and every one did bear
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
    And pour'd them down before him.

ANGUS
-1
We are sent
    To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;
    Only to herald thee into his sight,
    Not pay thee.

ROSS
-1
And for an earnest of a greater honor,
    He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.
    In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,
    For it is thine.

BANQUO
-1
What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH
-1
The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me
    In borrow'd robes?

ANGUS
-1
Who was the Thane lives yet,
    But under heavy judgement bears that life
    Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
    He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
    But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
    Have overthrown him.

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
    The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus] Thanks for your
      pains.
    [Aside to Banquo] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
    When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
    Promised no less to them?

BANQUO
-1
[Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,
    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
    Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange;
    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
    Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
    In deepest consequence-
    Cousins, a word, I pray you.

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen.
    [Aside.] This supernatural soliciting
    Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,
    Why hath it given me earnest of success,
    Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
    If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the use of nature? Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings:
    My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,
    Shakes so my single state of man that function
    Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
    But what is not.

BANQUO
-1
Look, how our partner's rapt.

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] If chance will have me King, why, chance may
      crown me
    Without my stir.

BANQUO
-1
New honors come upon him,
    Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
    But with the aid of use.

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] Come what come may,
    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

BANQUO
-1
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH
-1
Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought
    With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
    Are register'd where every day I turn
    The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
    Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time,
    The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
    Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO
-1
Very gladly.

MACBETH
-1
Till then, enough. Come, friends.             Exeunt.

DUNCAN
-1
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
    Those in commission yet return'd?

MALCOLM
-1
My liege,
    They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
    With one that saw him die, who did report
    That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
    Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth
    A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been studied in his death,
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed
    As 'twere a careless trifle.

DUNCAN
-1
There's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face:
    He was a gentleman on whom I built
    An absolute trust.
             Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.
    O worthiest cousin!
    The sin of my ingratitude even now
    Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,
    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
    To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
    That the proportion both of thanks and payment
    Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
    More is thy due than more than all can pay.

MACBETH
-1
The service and the loyalty lowe,
    In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness' part
    Is to receive our duties, and our duties
    Are to your throne and state, children and servants,
    Which do but what they should, by doing everything
    Safe toward your love and honor.

DUNCAN
-1
Welcome hither.
    I have begun to plant thee, and will labor
    To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
    That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
    No less to have done so; let me infold thee
    And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO
-1
There if I grow,
    The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN
-1
My plenteous joys,
    Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves
    In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
    And you whose places are the nearest, know
    We will establish our estate upon
    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
    The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
    Not unaccompanied invest him only,
    But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
    On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
    And bind us further to you.

MACBETH
-1
The rest is labor, which is not used for you.
    I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
    The hearing of my wife with your approach;
    So humbly take my leave.

DUNCAN
-1
My worthy Cawdor!

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step
    On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
    For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
    Let not light see my black and deep desires.
    The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be
    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.          Exit.

DUNCAN
-1
True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant,
    And in his commendations I am fed;
    It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
    It is a peerless kinsman.                  Flourish. Exeunt.

LADY MACBETH
-1
"They met me in the day of success, and I have
    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
    King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
    coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
    and farewell."
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
    And chastise with the valor of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.
                     Enter a Messenger.
    What is your tidings?

MESSENGER
-1
The King comes here tonight.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Thou'rt mad to say it!
    Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
    Would have inform'd for preparation.

MESSENGER
-1
So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
    One of my fellows had the speed of him,
    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
    Than would make up his message.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Give him tending;

MACBETH
-1
My dearest love,
    Duncan comes here tonight.

LADY MACBETH
-1
And when goes hence?

MACBETH
-1
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

LADY MACBETH
-1
O, never
    Shall sun that morrow see!
    Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men
    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
    Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under it. He that's coming
    Must be provided for; and you shall put
    This night's great business into my dispatch,
    Which shall to all our nights and days to come
    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

MACBETH
-1
We will speak further.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Only look up clear;
    To alter favor ever is to fear.
    Leave all the rest to me.                            Exeunt.

DUNCAN
-1
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Unto our gentle senses.

BANQUO
-1
This guest of summer,
    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
    The air is delicate.
                     Enter Lady Macbeth.

DUNCAN
-1
See, see, our honor'd hostess!
    The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
    Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
    How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains,
    And thank us for your trouble.

LADY MACBETH
-1
All our service
    In every point twice done, and then done double,
    Were poor and single business to contend
    Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
    Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,
    And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
    We rest your hermits.

DUNCAN
-1
Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
    We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
    To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
    To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
    We are your guest tonight.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Your servants ever
    Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
    To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,
    Still to return your own.

DUNCAN
-1
Give me your hand;
    Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly,
    And shall continue our graces towards him.
    By your leave, hostess.                              Exeunt.

MACBETH
-1
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done quickly. If the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
    With his surcease, success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught return
    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murtherer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off,
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.
                 Enter Lady Macbeth.
    How now, what news?

LADY MACBETH
-1
He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?

MACBETH
-1
Hath he ask'd for me?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Know you not he has?

MACBETH
-1
We will proceed no further in this business:
    He hath honor'd me of late, and I have bought
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
    Not cast aside so soon.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Was the hope drunk
    Wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since?
    And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
    At what it did so freely? From this time
    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
    To be the same in thine own act and valor
    As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
    And live a coward in thine own esteem,
    Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"
    Like the poor cat i' the adage?

MACBETH
-1
Prithee, peace!
    I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.

LADY MACBETH
-1
What beast wast then
    That made you break this enterprise to me?
    When you durst do it, then you were a man,
    And, to be more than what you were, you would
    Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.
    They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
    Does unmake you. I have given suck and know
    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me-
    I would, while it was smiling in my face,
    Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums
    And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you
    Have done to this.

MACBETH
-1
If we should fail?

LADY MACBETH
-1
We fail?
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place
    And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-
    Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
    Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains
    Will I with wine and wassail so convince
    That memory, the warder of the brain,
    Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
    A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
    What cannot you and I perform upon
    The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon
    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
    Of our great quell?

MACBETH
-1
Bring forth men-children only,
    For thy undaunted mettle should compose
    Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
    Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
    That they have done't?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Who dares receive it other,
    As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
    Upon his death?

MACBETH
-1
I am settled and bend up
    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
    Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
    False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
                                                         Exeunt.

BANQUO
-1
How goes the night, boy?

FLEANCE
-1
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

BANQUO
-1
And she goes down at twelve.

FLEANCE
-1
I take't 'tis later, sir.

BANQUO
-1
Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven,
    Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
    A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
    And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,
    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
    Gives way to in repose!
           Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.
    Give me my sword.
    Who's there?

MACBETH
-1
A friend.

BANQUO
-1
What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed.
    He hath been in unusual pleasure and
    Sent forth great largess to your offices.
    This diamond he greets your wife withal,
    By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
    In measureless content.

MACBETH
-1
Being unprepared,
    Our will became the servant to defect,
    Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO
-1
All's well.
    I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
    To you they have show'd some truth.

MACBETH
-1
I think not of them;
    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
    We would spend it in some words upon that business,
    If you would grant the time.

BANQUO
-1
At your kind'st leisure.

MACBETH
-1
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
    It shall make honor for you.

BANQUO
-1
So I lose none
    In seeking to augment it, but still keep
    My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
    I shall be counsel'd.

MACBETH
-1
Good repose the while.

BANQUO
-1
Thanks, sir, the like to you.

MACBETH
-1
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,

LADY MACBETH
-1
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
    What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!
    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it:
    The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
    Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg'd their possets
    That death and nature do contend about them,
    Whether they live or die.

MACBETH
-1
[Within.] Who's there' what, ho!

LADY MACBETH
-1
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked
    And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
    Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
    He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
    My father as he slept, I had done't.
                      Enter Macbeth,
    My husband!

MACBETH
-1
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

LADY MACBETH
-1
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
    Did not you speak?

MACBETH
-1
When?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Now.

MACBETH
-1
As I descended?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Ay.

MACBETH
-1
Hark!
    Who lies i' the second chamber?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Donalbain.

MACBETH
-1
This is a sorry sight.           [Looks on his hands.

LADY MACBETH
-1
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

MACBETH
-1
There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried,
      "Murther!"
    That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them,
    But they did say their prayers and address'd them
    Again to sleep.

LADY MACBETH
-1
There are two lodged together.

MACBETH
-1
One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other,
    As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
    Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen,"
    When they did say, "God bless us!"

LADY MACBETH
-1
Consider it not so deeply.

MACBETH
-1
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
    I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
    Stuck in my throat.

LADY MACBETH
-1
These deeds must not be thought
    After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

MACBETH
-1
I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
    Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
    Chief nourisher in life's feast-

LADY MACBETH
-1
What do you mean?

MACBETH
-1
Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house;
    "Glamis hath murther'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
    Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more."

LADY MACBETH
-1
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy Thane,
    You do unbend your noble strength, to think
    So brainsickly of things. Go, get some water
    And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
    Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
    They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear
    The sleepy grooms with blood.

MACBETH
-1
I'll go no more.
    I am afraid to think what I have done;
    Look on't again I dare not.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Infirm of purpose!
    Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
    Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
    I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
    For it must seem their guilt.         Exit. Knocking within.

MACBETH
-1
Whence is that knocking?
    How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
    What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!
    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.
                   Enter Lady Macbeth.

LADY MACBETH
-1
My hands are of your color, but I shame
    To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear knocking
    At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.
    A little water clears us of this deed.
    How easy is it then! Your constancy
    Hath left you unattended. [Knocking within.] Hark, more knocking.
    Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us
    And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
    So poorly in your thoughts.

MACBETH
-1
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
                                                Knocking within.
    Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
                                                         Exeunt.

PORTER
-1
Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of Hell
    Gate, he should have old turning the key. [Knocking within.]
    Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub? Here's
    a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty. Come
    in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat fort.
    [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other
    devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in
    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason
    enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O,
    come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock!
    Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for
    stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may
    roast your goose. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at
    quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll
    devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of
    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting
    bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the
    porter.
                                                 Opens the gate.
                       Enter Macduff and Lennox.

MACDUFF
-1
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
    That you do lie so late?

PORTER
-1
Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and
    drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.

MACDUFF
-1
What three things does drink especially provoke?

PORTER
-1
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir,
    it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes
    away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an
    equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
    him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens
    him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion,
    equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.

MACDUFF
-1
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

PORTER
-1
That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited
    him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though
    he took up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.

MACDUFF
-1
Is thy master stirring?
                             Enter Macbeth.
    Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

LENNOX
-1
Good morrow, noble sir.

MACBETH
-1
morrow, both.

MACDUFF
-1
Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?

MACBETH
-1
Not yet.

MACDUFF
-1
He did command me to call timely on him;
    I have almost slipp'd the hour.

MACBETH
-1
I'll bring you to him.

MACDUFF
-1
I know this is a joyful trouble to you,
    But yet 'tis one.

MACBETH
-1
The labor we delight in physics pain.
    This is the door.
    For 'tis my limited service.                           Exit.

LENNOX
-1
Goes the King hence today?

MACBETH
-1
He does; he did appoint so.

LENNOX
-1
The night has been unruly. Where we lay,
    Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,
    Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,
    And prophesying with accents terrible
    Of dire combustion and confused events
    New hatch'd to the woeful time. The obscure bird
    Clamor'd the livelong night. Some say the earth
    Was feverous and did shake.

MACBETH
-1
'Twas a rough fight.

LENNOX
-1
My young remembrance cannot parallel
    A fellow to it.
                      Enter Macduff.

MACDUFF
-1
O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
    Cannot conceive nor name thee.

MACBETH
-1
LENNOX. What's the matter?

MACDUFF
-1
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
    Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope
    The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence
    The life o' the building.

MACBETH
-1
What is't you say? the life?

LENNOX
-1
Mean you his Majesty?

MACDUFF
-1
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
    With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak;
    See, and then speak yourselves.

LADY MACBETH
-1
What's the business,
    That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
    The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!

MACDUFF
-1
O gentle lady,
    'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
    The repetition in a woman's ear
    Would murther as it fell.
                     Enter Banquo.
    O Banquo, Banquo!
    Our royal master's murther'd.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Woe, alas!
    What, in our house?

BANQUO
-1
Too cruel anywhere.
    Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
    And say it is not so.
          Enter Macbeth and Lennox, with Ross.

MACBETH
-1
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
    I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant
    There's nothing serious in mortality.
    All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vault to brag of.
                Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.

DONALBAIN
-1
What is amiss?

MACBETH
-1
You are, and do not know't.
    The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
    Is stopped, the very source of it is stopp'd.

MACDUFF
-1
Your royal father's murther'd.

LENNOX
-1
Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done't.
    Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;
    So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
    Upon their pillows.
    They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
    Was to be trusted with them.

MACBETH
-1
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
    That I did kill them.

MACDUFF
-1
Wherefore did you so?

MACBETH
-1
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
    Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man.
    The expedition of my violent love
    Outrun the pauser reason. Here lay Duncan,
    His silver skin laced with his golden blood,
    And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
    For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers,
    Steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers
    Unmannerly breech'd with gore. Who could refrain,
    That had a heart to love, and in that heart
    Courage to make 's love known?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Help me hence, ho!

MACDUFF
-1
Look to the lady.

MALCOLM
-1
[Aside to Donalbain.] Why do we hold our tongues,
    That most may claim this argument for ours?

DONALBAIN
-1
[Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here, where
      our fate,
    Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?
    Let's away,
    Our tears are not yet brew'd.

MALCOLM
-1
[Aside to Donalbain.] Nor our strong sorrow
    Upon the foot of motion.

BANQUO
-1
Look to the lady.
                                    Lady Macbeth is carried out.
    And when we have our naked frailties hid,
    That suffer in exposure, let us meet
    And question this most bloody piece of work
    To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.
    In the great hand of God I stand, and thence
    Against the undivulged pretense I fight
    Of treasonous malice.

MACDUFF
-1
And so do I.

ALL
-1
So all.

MACBETH
-1
Let's briefly put on manly readiness
    And meet i' the hall together.

ALL
-1
Well contented.

MALCOLM
-1
What will you do? Let's not consort with them.
    To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
    Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.

DONALBAIN
-1
To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
    Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are
    There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood,
    The nearer bloody.

MALCOLM
-1
This murtherous shaft that's shot
    Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
    Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;
    And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
    But shift away. There's warrant in that theft
    Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.
                                                         Exeunt.

OLD MAN
-1
Threescore and ten I can remember well,
    Within the volume of which time I have seen
    Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night
    Hath trifled former knowings.

ROSS
-1
Ah, good father,
    Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
    Threaten his bloody stage. By the clock 'tis day,
    And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
    Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
    That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
    When living light should kiss it?

OLD MAN
-1
'Tis unnatural,
    Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last
    A falcon towering in her pride of place
    Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

ROSS
-1
And Duncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain-
    Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
    Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
    Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
    War with mankind.

OLD MAN
-1
'Tis said they eat each other.

ROSS
-1
They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
    That look'd upon't.
                     Enter Macduff.
    Here comes the good Macduff.
    How goes the world, sir, now?

MACDUFF
-1
Why, see you not?

ROSS
-1
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF
-1
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

ROSS
-1
Alas, the day!
    What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF
-1
They were suborn'd:
    Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,
    Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them
    Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS
-1
'Gainst nature still!
    Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
    Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
    The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

MACDUFF
-1
He is already named, and gone to Scone
    To be invested.

ROSS
-1
Where is Duncan's body?

MACDUFF
-1
Carried to Colmekill,
    The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
    And guardian of their bones.

ROSS
-1
Will you to Scone?

MACDUFF
-1
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

ROSS
-1
Well, I will thither.

MACDUFF
-1
Well, may you see things well done there.
    Adieu,
    Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

ROSS
-1
Farewell, father.

OLD MAN
-1
God's benison go with you and with those
    That would make good of bad and friends of foes!
                                                         Exeunt.

BANQUO
-1
Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
    As the weird women promised, and I fear
    Thou play'dst most foully for't; yet it was said
    It should not stand in thy posterity,
    But that myself should be the root and father
    Of many kings. If there come truth from them
    (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well
    And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.
      Sennet sounds. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth
    as Queen, Lennox, Ross, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.

MACBETH
-1
Here's our chief guest.

LADY MACBETH
-1
If he had been forgotten,
    It had been as a gap in our great feast
    And all thing unbecoming.

MACBETH
-1
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
    And I'll request your presence.

BANQUO
-1
Let your Highness
    Command upon me, to the which my duties
    Are with a most indissoluble tie
    Forever knit.

MACBETH
-1
Ride you this afternoon?

BANQUO
-1
Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH
-1
We should have else desired your good advice,
    Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
    In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.
    Is't far you ride'!

BANQUO
-1
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
    'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
    I must become a borrower of the night
    For a dark hour or twain.

MACBETH
-1
Fail not our feast.

BANQUO
-1
My lord, I will not.

MACBETH
-1
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd
    In England and in Ireland, not confessing
    Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
    With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,
    When therewithal we shall have cause of state
    Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse; adieu,
    Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

BANQUO
-1
Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon 's.

MACBETH
-1
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,
    And so I do commend you to their backs.

MACBETH
-1
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,
    And so I do commend you to their backs.
    Farewell.                                       Exit     Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night; to make society
    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
    Till supper time alone. While then, God be with you!

ATTENDANT
-1
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

MACBETH
-1
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

MACBETH
-1
Bring them before us.                 Exit     To be thus is nothing,
    But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.
    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear; and under him
    My genius is rebuked, as it is said
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of King upon me
    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings.
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,
    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?
        Enter Attendant, with two Murtherers.
    Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
It was, so please your Highness.

MACBETH
-1
Well then, now
    Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
    That it was he in the times past which held you
    So under fortune, which you thought had been
    Our innocent self? This I made good to you
    In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you:
    How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,
    Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
    To half a soul and to a notion crazed
    Say, "Thus did Banquo."

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
You made it known to us.

MACBETH
-1
I did so, and went further, which is now
    Our point of second meeting. Do you find
    Your patience so predominant in your nature,
    That you can let this go? Are you so gospel'd,
    To pray for this good man and for his issue,
    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
    And beggar'd yours forever?

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
We are men, my liege.

MACBETH
-1
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,
    As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
    Shoughs, waterrugs, and demi-wolves are clept
    All by the name of dogs. The valued file
    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
    The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
    According to the gift which bounteous nature
    Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive
    Particular addition, from the bill
    That writes them all alike; and so of men.
    Now if you have a station in the file,
    Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it,
    And I will put that business in your bosoms
    Whose execution takes your enemy off,
    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
    Which in his death were perfect.

SECOND MURTHERER
-1
I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
And I another
    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
    That I would set my life on any chance,
    To mend it or be rid on't.

MACBETH
-1
Both of you
    Know Banquo was your enemy.

BOTH MURTHERERS
-1
True, my lord.

MACBETH
-1
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance
    That every minute of his being thrusts
    Against my near'st of life; and though I could
    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
    For certain friends that are both his and mine,
    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
    Who I myself struck down. And thence it is
    That I to your assistance do make love,
    Masking the business from the common eye
    For sundry weighty reasons.

SECOND MURTHERER
-1
We shall, my lord,
    Perform what you command us.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Though our lives-

MACBETH
-1
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
    I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
    Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
    The moment on't; fort must be done tonight
    And something from the palace (always thought
    That I require a clearness); and with him-
    To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-
    Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
    Whose absence is no less material to me
    Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
    Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart;
    I'll come to you anon.

BOTH MURTHERERS
-1
We are resolved, my lord.

MACBETH
-1
I'll call upon you straight. Abide within.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Is Banquo gone from court?

SERVANT
-1
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Say to the King I would attend his leisure
    For a few words.

SERVANT
-1
Madam, I will.                                  Exit.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Nought's had, all's spent,
    Where our desire is got without content.
    'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
    Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
                    Enter Macbeth.
    How now, my lord? Why do you keep alone,
    Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
    Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
    With them they think on? Things without all remedy
    Should be without regard. What's done is done.

MACBETH
-1
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.
    She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
    Remains in danger of her former tooth.
    But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
    Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
    In the affliction of these terrible dreams
    That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the torture of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
    Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can touch him further.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Come on,
    Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
    Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.

MACBETH
-1
So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.
    Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
    Unsafe the while, that we
    Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,
    And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
    Disguising what they are.

LADY MACBETH
-1
You must leave this.

MACBETH
-1
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
    Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.

LADY MACBETH
-1
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

MACBETH
-1
There's comfort yet; they are assailable.
    Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
    His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
    The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
    Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
    A deed of dreadful note.

LADY MACBETH
-1
What's to be done?

MACBETH
-1
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
    Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
    Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
    And with thy bloody and invisible hand
    Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
    Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow
    Makes wing to the rooky wood;
    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
    Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
    Thou marvel'st at my words, but hold thee still:
    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
    So, prithee, go with me.                             Exeunt.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
But who did bid thee join with us?

THIRD MURTHERER
-1
Macbeth.

SECOND MURTHERER
-1
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
    Our offices and what we have to do
    To the direction just.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Then stand with us.
    The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;
    Now spurs the lated traveler apace
    To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
    The subject of our watch.

THIRD MURTHERER
-1
Hark! I hear horses.

BANQUO
-1
[Within.] Give us a light there, ho!

SECOND MURTHERER
-1
Then 'tis he; the rest
    That are within the note of expectation
    Already are i' the court.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
His horses go about.

THIRD MURTHERER
-1
Almost a mile, but he does usually-
    So all men do -from hence to the palace gate
    Make it their walk.

SECOND MURTHERER
-1
A light, a light!
              Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.

THIRD MURTHERER
-1
'Tis he.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Stand to't.

BANQUO
-1
It will be rain tonight.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Let it come down.
                                           They set upon Banquo.

BANQUO
-1
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
    Thou mayst revenge. O slave!          Dies. Fleance escapes.

THIRD MURTHERER
-1
Who did strike out the light?

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Wast not the way?

THIRD MURTHERER
-1
There's but one down; the son is fled.

SECOND MURTHERER
-1
We have lost
    Best half of our affair.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Well, let's away and say how much is done.
                                                         Exeunt.

MACBETH
-1
You know your own degrees; sit down. At first
    And last the hearty welcome.

LORDS
-1
Thanks to your Majesty.

MACBETH
-1
Ourself will mingle with society
    And play the humble host.
    Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
    We will require her welcome.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
    For my heart speaks they are welcome.
                Enter first Murtherer to the door.

MACBETH
-1
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
    Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst.
    Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
    The table round. [Approaches the door.] There's blood upon thy
      face.

MURTHERER
-1
'Tis Banquo's then.

MACBETH
-1
'Tis better thee without than he within.
    Is he dispatch'd?

MURTHERER
-1
My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

MACBETH
-1
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats! Yet he's good
    That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it,
    Thou art the nonpareil.

MURTHERER
-1
Most royal sir,
    Fleance is 'scaped.

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,
    Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
    As broad and general as the casing air;
    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in
    To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe?

MURTHERER
-1
Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,
    With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
    The least a death to nature.

MACBETH
-1
Thanks for that.
    There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
    No teeth for the present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow
    We'll hear ourselves again.

LADY MACBETH
-1
My royal lord,
    You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold
    That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis amaking,
    'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
    Meeting were bare without it.

MACBETH
-1
Sweet remembrancer!
    Now good digestion wait on appetite,
    And health on both!

LENNOX
-1
May't please your Highness sit.
      Enter the GHOST of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place.

MACBETH
-1
Here had we now our country's honor roof'd,
    Were the graced person of our Banquo present,
    Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
    Than pity for mischance!

ROSS
-1
His absence, sir,
    Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your Highness
    To grace us with your royal company?

MACBETH
-1
The table's full.

LENNOX
-1
Here is a place reserved, sir.

MACBETH
-1
Where?

LENNOX
-1
Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your Highness?

MACBETH
-1
Which of you have done this?

LORDS
-1
What, my good lord?

MACBETH
-1
Thou canst not say I did it; never shake
    Thy gory locks at me.

ROSS
-1
Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is well.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,
    And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.
    The fit is momentary; upon a thought
    He will again be well. If much you note him,
    You shall offend him and extend his passion.
    Feed, and regard him not-Are you a man?

MACBETH
-1
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
    Which might appal the devil.

LADY MACBETH
-1
O proper stuff!
    This is the very painting of your fear;
    This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
    Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
    Impostors to true fear, would well become
    A woman's story at a winter's fire,
    Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
    Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
    You look but on a stool.

MACBETH
-1
Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?
    Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
    If charnel houses and our graves must send
    Those that we bury back, our monuments

LADY MACBETH
-1
What, quite unmann'd in folly?

MACBETH
-1
If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Fie, for shame!

MACBETH
-1
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
    Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
    Ay, and since too, murthers have been perform'd
    Too terrible for the ear. The time has been,
    That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
    And there an end; but now they rise again,
    With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,
    And push us from our stools. This is more strange
    Than such a murther is.

LADY MACBETH
-1
My worthy lord,
    Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH
-1
I do forget.
    Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
    I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
    To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
    Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine, fill full.
    I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
    Would he were here! To all and him we thirst,
    And all to all.

LORDS
-1
Our duties and the pledge.
                     Enter GHOST.

MACBETH
-1
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
    Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
    Which thou dost glare with.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Think of this, good peers,
    But as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other,
    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH
-1
What man dare, I dare.
    Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
    Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
    If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
    The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!

LADY MACBETH
-1
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
    With most admired disorder.

MACBETH
-1
Can such things be,
    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
    Without our special wonder? You make me strange
    Even to the disposition that I owe
    When now I think you can behold such sights
    And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
    When mine is blanch'd with fear.

ROSS
-1
What sights, my lord?

LADY MACBETH
-1
I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
    Question enrages him. At once, good night.
    Stand not upon the order of your going,
    But go at once.

LENNOX
-1
Good night, and better health
    Attend his Majesty!

LADY MACBETH
-1
A kind good night to all!

MACBETH
-1
will have blood; they say blood will have blood.
    Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
    Augures and understood relations have
    By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
    The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

MACBETH
-1
How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
    At our great bidding?

LADY MACBETH
-1
Did you send to him, sir?

MACBETH
-1
I hear it by the way, but I will send.
    There's not a one of them but in his house
    I keep a servant feed. I will tomorrow,
    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
    More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
    By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good
    All causes shall give way. I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
    Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
    Strange things I have in head that will to hand,
    Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

LADY MACBETH
-1
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH
-1
Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
    Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
    We are yet but young in deed.                       Exeunt.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.

HECATE
-1
Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
    Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
    To trade and traffic with Macbeth
    In riddles and affairs of death,
    And I, the mistress of your charms,
    The close contriver of all harms,
    Was never call'd to bear my part,
    Or show the glory of our art?
    And, which is worse, all you have done
    Hath been but for a wayward son,
    Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
    Loves for his own ends, not for you.
    But make amends now. Get you gone,
    And at the pit of Acheron
    Meet me i' the morning. Thither he
    Will come to know his destiny.
    Your vessels and your spells provide,
    Your charms and everything beside.
    I am for the air; this night I'll spend
    Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
    Great business must be wrought ere noon:
    Upon the corner of the moon
    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
    I'll catch it ere it come to ground.
    And that distill'd by magic sleights
    Shall raise such artificial sprites
    As by the strength of their illusion
    Shall draw him on to his confusion.
    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
    His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
    And you all know security
    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
                                        Music and a song within,
                                         "Come away, come away."
    Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
    Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.                Exit.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
                                                         Exeunt.

LENNOX
-1
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
    Which can interpret farther; only I say
    Thing's have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
    Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
    And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
    Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
    For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
    Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
    To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!
    How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight,
    In pious rage, the two delinquents tear
    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
    Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,
    For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
    To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
    He has borne all things well; and I do think
    That, had he Duncan's sons under his key-
    As, an't please heaven, he shall not -they should find
    What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
    But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd
    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,
    Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
    Where he bestows himself?

LORD
-1
The son of Duncan,
    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
    Lives in the English court and is received
    Of the most pious Edward with such grace
    That the malevolence of fortune nothing
    Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
    Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid
    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;
    That by the help of these, with Him above
    To ratify the work, we may again
    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
    Do faithful homage, and receive free honors-
    All which we pine for now. And this report
    Hath so exasperate the King that he
    Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX
-1
Sent he to Macduff?

LORD
-1
He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"
    The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
    And hums, as who should say, "You'll rue the time
    That clogs me with this answer."

LENNOX
-1
And that well might
    Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
    His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
    Fly to the court of England and unfold
    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
    May soon return to this our suffering country
    Under a hand accursed!

LORD
-1
I'll send my prayers with him.
                                                         Exeunt.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

SECOND WITCH
-1
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

THIRD WITCH
-1
Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time."

FIRST WITCH
-1
Round about the cauldron go;
    In the poison'd entrails throw.
    Toad, that under cold stone
    Days and nights has thirty-one
    Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
    Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

ALL
-1
Double, double, toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

SECOND WITCH
-1
Fillet of a fenny snake,
    In the cauldron boil and bake;
    Eye of newt and toe of frog,
    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
    Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
    Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
    For a charm of powerful trouble,
    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL
-1
Double, double, toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

THIRD WITCH
-1
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
    Witch's mummy, maw and gulf
    Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
    Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
    Liver of blaspheming Jew,
    Gall of goat and slips of yew
    Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse,
    Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
    Finger of birth-strangled babe
    Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
    Make the gruel thick and slab.
    Add thereto a tiger's chawdron,
    For the ingredients of our cawdron.

ALL
-1
Double, double, toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

SECOND WITCH
-1
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
    Then the charm is firm and good.
            Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.

HECATE
-1
O, well done! I commend your pains,
    And everyone shall share i' the gains.
    And now about the cauldron sing,
    Like elves and fairies in a ring,
    Enchanting all that you put in.
                              Music and a song, "Black spirits."
                                                 Hecate retires.

SECOND WITCH
-1
By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
    Open, locks,
    Whoever knocks!
                      Enter Macbeth.

MACBETH
-1
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
    What is't you do?

ALL
-1
A deed without a name.

MACBETH
-1
I conjure you, by that which you profess
    (Howeer you come to know it) answer me:
    Though you untie the winds and let them fight
    Against the churches, though the yesty waves
    Confound and swallow navigation up,
    Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,
    Though castles topple on their warders' heads,
    Though palaces and pyramids do slope
    Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure
    Of nature's germaines tumble all together
    Even till destruction sicken, answer me
    To what I ask you.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Speak.

SECOND WITCH
-1
Demand.

THIRD WITCH
-1
We'll answer.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
    Or from our masters'?

MACBETH
-1
Call 'em, let me see 'em.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten
    Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
    From the murtherer's gibbet throw
    Into the flame.

ALL
-1
Come, high or low;
    Thyself and office deftly show!
            Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head.

MACBETH
-1
Tell me, thou unknown power-

FIRST WITCH
-1
He knows thy thought:
    Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

FIRST APPARITION
-1
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,
    Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
                                                       Descends.

MACBETH
-1
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
    Thou hast harp'd my fear aright. But one word more-

FIRST WITCH
-1
He will not be commanded. Here's another,
    More potent than the first.
          Thunder. Second Apparition: a bloody Child.

SECOND APPARITION
-1
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

MACBETH
-1
Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.

SECOND APPARITION
-1
Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn
    The power of man, for none of woman born
    Shall harm Macbeth.                                Descends.

MACBETH
-1
Then live, Macduff. What need I fear of thee?
    But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
    And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,
    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
    And sleep in spite of thunder.
       Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,
               with a tree in his hand.
    What is this,
    That rises like the issue of a king,
    And wears upon his baby brow the round
    And top of sovereignty?

ALL
-1
Listen, but speak not to't.

THIRD APPARITION
-1
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
    Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
    Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
    Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill
    Shall come against him.                            Descends.

MACBETH
-1
That will never be.
    Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
    Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good!
    Rebellion's head, rise never till the Wood
    Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
    Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
    To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
    Can tell so much, shall Banquo's issue ever
    Reign in this kingdom?

ALL
-1
Seek to know no more.

MACBETH
-1
I will be satisfied! Deny me this,
    And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
    Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?
                                                       Hautboys.

FIRST WITCH
-1
Show!

SECOND WITCH
-1
Show!

THIRD
-1
WITCH. Show!

ALL
-1
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
    Come like shadows, so depart!
    A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
                   Banquo's Ghost following.

MACBETH
-1
Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down!
    Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,
    Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
    A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
    Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
    Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more!
    And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
    Which shows me many more; and some I see
    That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.
    Horrible sight! Now I see 'tis true;
    For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
    And points at them for his. What, is this so?

FIRST WITCH
-1
Ay, sir, all this is so. But why
    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
    Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
    And show the best of our delights.
    I'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round,
    That this great King may kindly say
    Our duties did his welcome pay.
                                    Music. The Witches dance and
                                        then vanish with Hecate.

MACBETH
-1
are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
    Stand ay accursed in the calendar!
    Come in, without there!
                    Enter Lennox.

LENNOX
-1
What's your Grace's will?

MACBETH
-1
Saw you the weird sisters?

LENNOX
-1
No, my lord.

MACBETH
-1
Came they not by you?

LENNOX
-1
No indeed, my lord.

MACBETH
-1
Infected be the 'air whereon they ride,
    And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
    The galloping of horse. Who wast came by?

LENNOX
-1
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
    Macduff is fled to England.

MACBETH
-1
Fled to England?

LENNOX
-1
Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH
-1
[Aside.] Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.
    The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
    Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
    The very firstlings of my heart shall be
    The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
    The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
    Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword
    His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
    That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
    This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
    But no more sights! -Where are these gentlemen?
    Come, bring me where they are.                       Exeunt.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
What had he done, to make him fly the land?

ROSS
-1
You must have patience, madam.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
He had none;
    His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.

ROSS
-1
You know not
    Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
    His mansion, and his titles, in a place
    From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
    He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
    All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    As little is the wisdom, where the flight
    So runs against all reason.

ROSS
-1
My dearest coz,
    I pray you, school yourself. But for your husband,
    He is noble, wise, Judicious, and best knows
    The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further;
    But cruel are the times when we are traitors
    And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
    But float upon a wild and violent sea
    Each way and move. I take my leave of you;
    Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
    Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
    To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
    Blessing upon you!

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.

ROSS
-1
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
    I take my leave at once.                               Exit.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Sirrah, your father's dead.
    And what will you do now? How will you live?

SON
-1
As birds do, Mother.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
What, with worms and flies?

SON
-1
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
    The pitfall nor the gin.

SON
-1
Why should I, Mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
    My father is not dead, for all your saying.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father?

SON
-1
Nay, how will you do for a husband?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

SON
-1
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i' faith,
    With wit enough for thee.

SON
-1
Was my father a traitor, Mother?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Ay, that he was.

SON
-1
What is a traitor?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Why one that swears and lies.

SON
-1
And be all traitors that do so?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be
     hanged.

SON
-1
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Everyone.

SON
-1
Who must hang them?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Why, the honest men.

SON
-1
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and
    swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do
    for a father?

SON
-1
If he were dead, you'ld weep for him; if you would not, it
    were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
                    Enter a Messenger.

MESSENGER
-1
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
    Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
    I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
    If you will take a homely man's advice,
    Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
    To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;
    To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
    Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
    I dare abide no longer.                                Exit.

LADY MACDUFF
-1
Whither should I fly?
    I have done no harm. But I remember now
    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
    Is often laudable, to do good sometime
    Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
    Do I put up that womanly defense,
    To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?
                      Enter Murtherers.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
Where is your husband?

LADY MACDUFF
-1
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
    Where such as thou mayst find him.

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
He's a traitor.

SON
-1
Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!

FIRST MURTHERER
-1
What, you egg!
                                                      Stabs him.
    Young fry of treachery!

SON
-1
He has kill'd me, Mother.
    Run away, I pray you!                                  Dies.

SON
-1
He has kill'd me, Mother.
    Run away, I pray you!                                  Dies.
                            Exit 
MALCOLM
-1
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
    Weep our sad bosoms empty.

MACDUFF
-1
Let us rather
    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
    Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn
    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
    Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
    As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
    Like syllable of dolor.

MALCOLM
-1
What I believe, I'll wall;
    What know, believe; and what I can redress,
    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
    What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
    This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
    Was once thought honest. You have loved him well;
    He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young, but something
    You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
    To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
    To appease an angry god.

MACDUFF
-1
I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM
-1
But Macbeth is.
    A good and virtuous nature may recoil
    In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;
    That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
    Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
    Yet grace must still look so.

MACDUFF
-1
I have lost my hopes.

MALCOLM
-1
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
    Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
    Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
    Without leave-taking? I pray you,
    Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,
    But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
    Whatever I shall think.

MACDUFF
-1
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
    Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
    For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy wrongs;
    The title is affeer'd. Fare thee well, lord.
    I would not be the villain that thou think'st
    For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
    And the rich East to boot.

MALCOLM
-1
Be not offended;
    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
    I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
    It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
    Is added to her wounds. I think withal
    There would be hands uplifted in my right;
    And here from gracious England have I offer
    Of goodly thousands. But for all this,
    When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
    Shall have more vices than it had before,
    More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
    By him that shall succeed.

MACDUFF
-1
What should he be?

MALCOLM
-1
It is myself I mean, in whom I know
    All the particulars of vice so grafted
    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
    With my confineless harms.

MACDUFF
-1
Not in the legions
    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
    In evils to top Macbeth.

MALCOLM
-1
I grant him bloody,
    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
    Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
    That has a name. But there's no bottom, none,
    In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,
    Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
    The cestern of my lust, and my desire
    All continent impediments would o'erbear
    That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth
    Than such an one to reign.

MACDUFF
-1
Boundless intemperance
    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
    The untimely emptying of the happy throne,
    And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
    To take upon you what is yours. You may
    Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
    And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
    We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
    That vulture in you to devour so many
    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
    Finding it so inclined.

MALCOLM
-1
With this there grows
    In my most ill-composed affection such
    A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
    I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
    Desire his jewels and this other's house,
    And my more-having would be as a sauce
    To make me hunger more, that I should forge
    Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
    Destroying them for wealth.

MACDUFF
-1
This avarice
    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
    The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear;
    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
    Of your mere own. All these are portable,
    With other graces weigh'd.

MALCOLM
-1
But I have none. The king-becoming graces,
    As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
    Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
    Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
    I have no relish of them, but abound
    In the division of each several crime,
    Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
    Uproar the universal peace, confound
    All unity on earth.

MACDUFF
-1
O Scotland, Scotland!

MALCOLM
-1
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
    I am as I have spoken.

MACDUFF
-1
Fit to govern?
    No, not to live. O nation miserable!
    With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
    When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
    Since that the truest issue of thy throne
    By his own interdiction stands accursed
    And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
    Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,
    Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
    Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
    These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
    Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
    Thy hope ends here!

MALCOLM
-1
Macduff, this noble passion,
    Child of integrity, hath from my soul
    Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
    To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
    By many of these trains hath sought to win me
    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
    From over-credulous haste. But God above
    Deal between thee and me! For even now
    I put myself to thy direction and
    Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
    For strangers to my nature. I am yet
    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
    At no time broke my faith, would not betray
    The devil to his fellow, and delight
    No less in truth than life. My first false speaking
    Was this upon myself. What I am truly
    Is thine and my poor country's to command.
    Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
    Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men
    Already at a point, was setting forth.
    Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
    Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

MACDUFF
-1
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
    'Tis hard to reconcile.
                     Enter a Doctor.

MALCOLM
-1
Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you?

DOCTOR
-1
Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls
    That stay his cure. Their malady convinces
    The great assay of art, but at his touch,
    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,
    They presently amend.

MALCOLM
-1
Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls
    That stay his cure. Their malady convinces
    The great assay of art, but at his touch,
    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,
    They presently amend.

MACDUFF
-1
What's the disease he means?

MALCOLM
-1
'Tis call'd the evil:
    A most miraculous work in this good King,
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
    All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And sundry blessings hang about his throne
    That speak him full of grace.
                    Enter Ross.

MACDUFF
-1
See, who comes here?

MALCOLM
-1
My countryman, but yet I know him not.

MACDUFF
-1
My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM
-1
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
    The means that makes us strangers!

ROSS
-1
Sir, amen.

MACDUFF
-1
Stands Scotland where it did?

ROSS
-1
Alas, poor country,
    Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot
    Be call'd our mother, but our grave. Where nothing,
    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air,
    Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
    A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
    Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives
    Expire before the flowers in their caps,
    Dying or ere they sicken.

MACDUFF
-1
O, relation
    Too nice, and yet too true!

MALCOLM
-1
What's the newest grief?

ROSS
-1
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;
    Each minute teems a new one.

MACDUFF
-1
How does my wife?

ROSS
-1
Why, well.

MACDUFF
-1
And all my children?

ROSS
-1
Well too.

MACDUFF
-1
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

ROSS
-1
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

MACDUFF
-1
Be not a niggard of your speech. How goest?

ROSS
-1
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
    Of many worthy fellows that were out,
    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
    For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
    Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
    To doff their dire distresses.

MALCOLM
-1
Be't their comfort
    We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
    Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
    An older and a better soldier none
    That Christendom gives out.

ROSS
-1
Would I could answer
    This comfort with the like! But I have words
    That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
    Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF
-1
What concern they?
    The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief
    Due to some single breast?

ROSS
-1
No mind that's honest
    But in it shares some woe, though the main part
    Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF
-1
If it be mine,
    Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

ROSS
-1
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
    That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF
-1
Humh! I guess at it.

ROSS
-1
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
    Savagely slaughter'd. To relate the manner
    Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer,
    To add the death of you.

MALCOLM
-1
Merciful heaven!
    What, man! Neer pull your hat upon your brows;
    Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.

MACDUFF
-1
My children too?

ROSS
-1
Wife, children, servants, all
    That could be found.

MACDUFF
-1
And I must be from thence!
    My wife kill'd too?

ROSS
-1
I have said.

MALCOLM
-1
Be comforted.
    Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
    To cure this deadly grief.

MACDUFF
-1
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
    Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?

MALCOLM
-1
Dispute it like a man.

MACDUFF
-1
I shall do so,
    But I must also feel it as a man.
    I cannot but remember such things were
    That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
    And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
    They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
    Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

MALCOLM
-1
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief
    Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

MACDUFF
-1
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
    And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
    Cut short all intermission; front to front
    Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
    Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
    Heaven forgive him too!

MALCOLM
-1
This tune goes manly.
    Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,
    Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
    Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
    Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may,
    The night is long that never finds the day.          Exeunt.

DOCTOR
-1
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no
    truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her
    rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her
    closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it,
    afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while
    in a most fast sleep.

DOCTOR
-1
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the
    benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery
    agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances,
    what, at any time, have you heard her say?

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
That, sir, which I will not report after her.

DOCTOR
-1
You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to
    confirm my speech.
                Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.
    Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise, and, upon my
    life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

DOCTOR
-1
How came she by that light?

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Why, it stood by her. She has light by her
     continually; 'tis her command.

DOCTOR
-1
You see, her eyes are open.

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Ay, but their sense is shut.

DOCTOR
-1
What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
    washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of
    an hour.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Yet here's a spot.

DOCTOR
-1
Hark, she speaks! I will set down what comes from her, to
    satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then 'tis
    time to do't. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and
    afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our
    power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have
    had so much blood in him?

DOCTOR
-1
Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH
-1
The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What,
    will these hands neer be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more
    o' that. You mar all with this starting.

DOCTOR
-1
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.
    Heaven knows what she has known.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes
    of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!

DOCTOR
-1
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
    dignity of the whole body.

DOCTOR
-1
Well, well, well-

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Pray God it be, sir.

DOCTOR
-1
This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those
    which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their
    beds.

LADY MACBETH
-1
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so
    pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out
    on's grave.

DOCTOR
-1
Even so?

LADY MACBETH
-1
To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come,
    come, come, come, give me your hand.What's done cannot be undone.
    To bed, to bed, to bed.

DOCTOR
-1
Will she go now to bed?

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Directly.

DOCTOR
-1
Foul whisperings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
    Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds
    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
    More needs she the divine than the physician.
    God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;
    Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
    And still keep eyes upon her. So good night.
    My mind she has mated and amazed my sight.
    I think, but dare not speak.

GENTLEWOMAN
-1
Good night, good doctor.
                                                         Exeunt.

MENTEITH
-1
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
    His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
    Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
    Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
    Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS
-1
Near Birnam Wood
    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

CAITHNESS
-1
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX
-1
For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file
    Of all the gentry. There is Seward's son
    And many unrough youths that even now
    Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH
-1
What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS
-1
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
    Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,
    Do call it valiant fury; but, for certain,
    He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
    Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS
-1
Now does he feel
    His secret murthers sticking on his hands,
    Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
    Those he commands move only in command,
    Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
    Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
    Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH
-1
Who then shall blame
    His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
    When all that is within him does condemn
    Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS
-1
Well, march we on
    To give obedience where 'tis truly owed.
    Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
    And with him pour we, in our country's purge,
    Each drop of us.

LENNOX
-1
Or so much as it needs
    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
    Make we our march towards Birnam.           Exeunt marching.

MACBETH
-1
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!
    Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
    I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
    Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
    "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
    Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly, false Thanes,
    And mingle with the English epicures!
    The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
    Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
                       Enter a Servant.
    The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
    Where got'st thou that goose look?

SERVANT
-1
There is ten thousand-

MACBETH
-1
Geese, villain?

SERVANT
-1
Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH
-1
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
    Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
    Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
    Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

SERVANT
-1
The English force, so please you.

MACBETH
-1
The English force, so please you.

SEYTON
-1
What's your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH
-1
What news more?

SEYTON
-1
All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH
-1
I'll fight, 'til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
    Give me my armor.

SEYTON
-1
'Tis not needed yet.

MACBETH
-1
I'll put it on.
    Send out more horses, skirr the country round,
    Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.
    How does your patient, doctor?

DOCTOR
-1
Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH
-1
Cure her of that.
    Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
    Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
    And with some sweet oblivious antidote
    Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
    Which weighs upon the heart?

DOCTOR
-1
Therein the patient
    Must minister to himself.

MACBETH
-1
Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.
    Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.
    Seyton, send out. Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.
    Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
    The water of my land, find her disease
    And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
    I would applaud thee to the very echo,
    That should applaud again. Pull't off, I say.
    What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug
    Would scour these English hence? Hearst thou of them?

DOCTOR
-1
Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation
    Makes us hear something.

MACBETH
-1
Bring it after me.
    I will not be afraid of death and bane
    Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.

DOCTOR
-1
[Aside.] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
    Profit again should hardly draw me here.             Exeunt.

MALCOLM
-1
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
    That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH
-1
We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD
-1
What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH
-1
The Wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM
-1
Let every soldier hew him down a bough,
    And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow
    The numbers of our host, and make discovery
    Err in report of us.

SOLDIERS
-1
It shall be done.

SIWARD
-1
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
    Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
    Our setting down before't.

MALCOLM
-1
'Tis his main hope;
    For where there is advantage to be given,
    Both more and less have given him the revolt,
    And none serve with him but constrained things
    Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF
-1
Let our just censures
    Attend the true event, and put we on
    Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD
-1
The time approaches
    That will with due decision make us know
    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
    Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
    But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.
    Towards which advance the war.

MACBETH
-1
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
    The cry is still, "They come!" Our castle's strength
    Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie
    Till famine and the ague eat them up.
    Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
    We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
    And beat them backward home.
                                          A cry of women within.
    What is that noise?

SEYTON
-1
It is the cry of women, my good lord.            Exit.

MACBETH
-1
I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
    Cannot once start me.
                  Enter Seyton.
     Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON
-1
The Queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH
-1
She should have died hereafter;
    There would have been a time for such a word.
    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time;
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.
                 Enter a Messenger.
    Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

MESSENGER
-1
Gracious my lord,
    I should report that which I say I saw,
    But know not how to do it.

MACBETH
-1
Well, say, sir.

MESSENGER
-1
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
    I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
    The Wood began to move.

MACBETH
-1
Liar and slave!

MESSENGER
-1
Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.
    Within this three mile may you see it coming;
    I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH
-1
If thou speak'st false,
    Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
    Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,
    I care not if thou dost for me as much.
    I pull in resolution and begin
    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
    That lies like truth. "Fear not, till Birnam Wood
    Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood
    Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
    If this which he avouches does appear,
    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
    I 'gin to be aweary of the sun
    And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
    Ring the alarum bell! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!
    At least we'll die with harness on our back.         Exeunt.

MALCOLM
-1
Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,
    And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
    Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
    Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
    Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
    According to our order.

SIWARD
-1
Fare you well.
    Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
    Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF
-1
Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,
    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
                                                         Exeunt.

MACBETH
-1
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
    But bear-like I must fight the course. What's he
    That was not born of woman? Such a one
    Am I to fear, or none.
                     Enter young Siward.

YOUNG SIWARD
-1
What is thy name?

MACBETH
-1
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG SIWARD
-1
No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
    Than any is in hell.

MACBETH
-1
My name's Macbeth.

YOUNG SIWARD
-1
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
    More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH
-1
No, nor more fearful.
    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
                          They fight, and young Seward is slain.

MACBETH
-1
Thou wast born of woman.
    But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
    Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.              Exit.
                Alarums. Enter Macduff.

MACDUFF
-1
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
    If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine,
    My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
    Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,
    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
    Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!
    And more I beg not.                           Exit. Alarums.
                Enter Malcolm and old Siward.

SIWARD
-1
This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.
    The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,
    The noble Thanes do bravely in the war,
    The day almost itself professes yours,
    And little is to do.

MALCOLM
-1
We have met with foes
    That strike beside us.

SIWARD
-1
Enter, sir, the castle.
                                                 Exeunt. Alarum.

MACBETH
-1
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
    On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes
    Do better upon them.
                      Enter Macduff.

MACDUFF
-1
Turn, hell hound, turn!

MACBETH
-1
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
    But get thee back, my soul is too much charged
    With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF
-1
I have no words.
    My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
    Than terms can give thee out!                    They fight.

MACBETH
-1
Thou losest labor.
    As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
    Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
    I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
    To one of woman born.

MACDUFF
-1
Despair thy charm,
    And let the angel whom thou still hast served
    Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
    Untimely ripp'd.

MACBETH
-1
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
    For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
    And be these juggling fiends no more believed
    That patter with us in a double sense,
    That keep the word of promise to our ear
    And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF
-1
Then yield thee, coward,
    And live to be the show and gaze o' the time.
    We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
    Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
    "Here may you see the tyrant."

MACBETH
-1
I will not yield,
    To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
    And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
    Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,
    And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
    Yet I will try the last. Before my body
    I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduff,
    And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"

MALCOLM
-1
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

SIWARD
-1
Some must go off, and yet, by these I see,
    So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM
-1
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS
-1
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
    He only lived but till he was a man,
    The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
    In the unshrinking station where he fought,
    But like a man he died.

SIWARD
-1
Then he is dead?

ROSS
-1
Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
    Must not be measured by his worth, for then
    It hath no end.

SIWARD
-1
Had he his hurts before?

ROSS
-1
Ay, on the front.

SIWARD
-1
Why then, God's soldier be he!
    Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
    I would not wish them to a fairer death.
    And so his knell is knoll'd.

MALCOLM
-1
He's worth more sorrow,
    And that I'll spend for him.

SIWARD
-1
He's worth no more:
    They say he parted well and paid his score,
    And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
             Enter Macduff, with Macbeth's head.

MACDUFF
-1
Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold where stands
    The usurper's cursed head. The time is free.
    I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
    That speak my salutation in their minds,
    Whose voices I desire aloud with mine-
    Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL
-1
Hail, King of Scotland!                         Flourish.

MALCOLM
-1
We shall not spend a large expense of time
    Before we reckon with your several loves
    And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen,
    Henceforth be Earls, the first that ever Scotland
    In such an honor named. What's more to do,
    Which would be planted newly with the time,
    As calling home our exiled friends abroad
    That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
    Producing forth the cruel ministers
    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
    Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
    Took off her life; this, and what needful else
    That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace
    We will perform in measure, time, and place.
    So thanks to all at once and to each one,
    Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
                                               Flourish. Exeunt.
                 -THE END-

Of government the properties to unfold

    My strength can give you; then no more remains
    But that to your sufficiency- as your worth is able-
    And let them work. The nature of our people,
    Our city's institutions, and the terms

If any in Vienna be of worth

Look where he comes.

ANGELO

Always obedient to your Grace's will,
    I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
LORDS
Angelo,
    There is a kind of character in thy life
    That to th' observer doth thy history
    Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
    Are not thine own so proper as to waste
    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
    Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
    Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
    Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
    As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
    But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends
    The smallest scruple of her excellence
    But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
    Herself the glory of a creditor,
    Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
    To one that can my part in him advertise.
    Hold, therefore, Angelo-
    In our remove be thou at full ourself;
    Mortality and mercy in Vienna
    Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
    Though first in question, is thy secondary.
    Take thy commission.

ANGELO

Now, good my lord,
    Let there be some more test made of my metal,
    Before so noble and so great a figure

No more evasion!
    We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
    Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
    Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
    That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd
    Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
    As time and our concernings shall importune,
    How it goes with us, and do look to know
    What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.
    To th' hopeful execution do I leave you
    Of your commissions.

Yet give leave, my lord,

My haste may not admit it;
    Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
    With any scruple: your scope is as mine own,
    So to enforce or qualify the laws
    As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
    I'll privily away. I love the people,
    But do not like to stage me to their eyes;
    Though it do well, I do not relish well
    Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
    Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
    That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition
    with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the
    King.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
    Hungary's!

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
Amen.

LUCIO
-1
Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to
    sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap'd one out of the table.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO
-1
Ay, that he raz'd.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain
    and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal.
    There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before
    meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO
-1
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was
    said.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
No? A dozen times at least.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
What, in metre?

LUCIO
-1
In any proportion or in any language.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO
-1
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,
    for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all
    grace.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO
-1
I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
    Thou art the list.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt
    a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of
    an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French
    velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?

LUCIO
-1
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of
    thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin
    thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
    free.
                        Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE

LUCIO
-1
Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have
    purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
To what, I pray?

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Judge.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
To three thousand dolours a year.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Ay, and more.

LUCIO
-1
A French crown more.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
    art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO
-1
Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things
    that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast
    of thee.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
How now! which of your hips has the most profound
    sciatica?

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried
    to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Who's that, I pray thee?

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him
    carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his
    head to be chopp'd off.

LUCIO
-1
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art
    thou sure of this?

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam
    Julietta with child.

LUCIO
-1
Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours
    since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
-1
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
    speech we had to such a purpose.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
-1
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO
-1
Away; let's go learn the truth of it.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
    with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.
                               Enter POMPEY
    How now! what's the news with you?

POMPEY
-1
Yonder man is carried to prison.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Well, what has he done?

POMPEY
-1
A woman.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. But what's his offence?

POMPEY
-1
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. What! is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY
-1
No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. What proclamation, man?

POMPEY
-1
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY
-1
They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that
    a wise burgher put in for them.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
    pull'd down?

POMPEY
-1
To the ground, mistress.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
    What shall become of me?

POMPEY
-1
Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.
    Though you change your place you need not change your trade; I'll
    be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you;
    you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will
    be considered.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.

POMPEY
-1
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;
    and there's Madam Juliet.                             Exeunt
            Enter PROVOST, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and OFFICERS;
                            LUCIO following

CLAUDIO
-1
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
    Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

PROVOST
-1
I do it not in evil disposition,
    But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO
-1
Thus can the demigod Authority
    Make us pay down for our offence by weight
    The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
    On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

LUCIO
-1
Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO
-1
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;
    As surfeit is the father of much fast,
    So every scope by the immoderate use
    Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
    Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
    A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO
-1
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for
    certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief
    have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment.
    What's thy offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO
-1
What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO
-1
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO
-1
No.

LUCIO
-1
Lechery?

CLAUDIO
-1
Call it so.

PROVOST
-1
Away, sir; you must go.

CLAUDIO
-1
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO
-1
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd
    after?

CLAUDIO
-1
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
    I got possession of Julietta's bed.
    You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
    Save that we do the denunciation lack
    Of outward order; this we came not to,
    Only for propagation of a dow'r
    Remaining in the coffer of her friends.
    From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
    Till time had made them for us. But it chances
    The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,
    With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO
-1
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO
-1
Unhappily, even so.
    And the new deputy now for the Duke-
    Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
    Or whether that the body public be
    A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
    Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
    He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
    Whether the tyranny be in his place,
    Or in his eminence that fills it up,
    I stagger in. But this new governor
    Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
    Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall
    So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
    And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
    Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
    Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name.

LUCIO
-1
I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy
    shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off.
    Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.

CLAUDIO
-1
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
    I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
    This day my sister should the cloister enter,
    And there receive her approbation;
    Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
    Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
    To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
    I have great hope in that; for in her youth
    There is a prone and speechless dialect
    Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
    When she will play with reason and discourse,
    And well she can persuade.

LUCIO
-1
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like,
    which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the
    enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus
    foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO
-1
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO
-1
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO
-1
Come, officer, away.                           Exeunt

DUKE
1
FRIAR
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
    Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
    Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
    To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
    More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
    Of burning youth.

FRIAR
1
DUKE
May your Grace speak of it?

DUKE
1
FRIAR
My holy sir, none better knows than you
    How I have ever lov'd the life removed,
    And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
    Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.
    I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
    A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
    My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
    And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
    For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
    And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
    You will demand of me why I do this.

FRIAR
1
DUKE
Gladly, my lord.

DUKE
1
FRIAR
We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
    The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,
    Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
    Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
    That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
    Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
    Only to stick it in their children's sight
    For terror, not to use, in time the rod
    Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
    Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
    And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
    The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
    Goes all decorum.

FRIAR
1
DUKE
It rested in your Grace
    To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;
    And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
    Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE
1
FRIAR
I do fear, too dreadful.
    Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
    'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
    For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,
    When evil deeds have their permissive pass
    And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
    I have on Angelo impos'd the office;
    Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,
    And yet my nature never in the fight
    To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
    I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
    Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,
    Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
    How I may formally in person bear me
    Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
    At our more leisure shall I render you.
    Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
    Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
    That his blood flows, or that his appetite
    Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,
    If power change purpose, what our seemers be.         Exeunt

And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA
1
ISABELLA
Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA

Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,

    Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
    Turn you the key, and know his business of him:
    You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn;
    When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
    But in the presence of the prioress;
    Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
    Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.

Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
    Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me
    As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
    A novice of this place, and the fair sister
    To her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA

Why her 'unhappy brother'? Let me ask
    The rather, for I now must make you know
    I am that Isabella, and his sister.

LUCIO

Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
    Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA

Woe me! For what?

LUCIO
0
ISABELLA
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
    He should receive his punishment in thanks:
    He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA
0
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO
0
ISABELLA
It is true.
    I would not- though 'tis my familiar sin
    With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
    Tongue far from heart- play with all virgins so:
    I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
    By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
    And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
    As with a saint.

ISABELLA
0
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO
0
ISABELLA
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
    Your brother and his lover have embrac'd.
    As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
    That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
    To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
    Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA

Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO

ISABELLA
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA

Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
    By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO

ISABELLA
She it is.

ISABELLA
0
O, let him marry her!

LUCIO

ISABELLA
This is the point.
    The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
    Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
    In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
    By those that know the very nerves of state,
    His givings-out were of an infinite distance
    From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
    And with full line of his authority,
    Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
    Is very snow-broth, one who never feels
    The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
    But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
    With profits of the mind, study and fast.
    He- to give fear to use and liberty,
    Which have for long run by the hideous law,
    As mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act
    Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
    Falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,
    And follows close the rigour of the statute
    To make him an example. All hope is gone,
    Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
    To soften Angelo. And that's my pith of business
    'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA
0
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO
0
ISABELLA
Has censur'd him
    Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath
    A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA
0
Alas! what poor ability's in me
    To do him good?

LUCIO
0
ISABELLA
Assay the pow'r you have.

ISABELLA
0
My power, alas, I doubt!

LUCIO
0
ISABELLA
Our doubts are traitors,
    And make us lose the good we oft might win
    By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
    And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
    Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
    All their petitions are as freely theirs
    As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA

I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO

ISABELLA
But speedily.

ISABELLA

I will about it straight;
    No longer staying but to give the Mother
    Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
    Commend me to my brother; soon at night

    I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I
    said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
    Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I
    said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you
    know, Master Froth, I could not give you three pence again-

FROTH

JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
No, indeed.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking
    the stones of the foresaid prunes-

FROTH
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
    that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you
    wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-

FROTH
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
All this is true.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Why, very well then-

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
    done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me
    to what was done to her.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
    I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of
    fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas- was't not
    at Hallowmas, Master Froth?

FROTH

JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
    I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes,
    where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?

FROTH
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO

ISABELLA
ESCALUS
This will last out a night in Russia,
    When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave,
    And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
    Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
    Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose. Doth
    your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Well, I do so.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Why, no.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
    about him. Good then; if his face be the worst thing about him,
    how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would
    know that of your honour.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
    this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected
    woman.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
    any of us all.

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
    yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or
    child.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
    true?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
    respected with her before I was married to her! If ever I was
    respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me
    the poor Duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
    I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
    action of slander too.

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
    worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
    thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his
    courses till thou know'st what they are.

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked
    varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art to continue now,
    thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS

ISABELLA
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Your mistress' name?

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
    would not have you acquainted with tapsters: they will draw you,
    Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me
    hear no more of you.

FROTH
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into
    any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.

ESCALUS

PROVOST
ISABELLA
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into
    any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.

POMPEY

Pompey.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
What else?

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
    that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey,
    you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a
    tapster. Are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better
    for you.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
    think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
    allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
    the city?

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
No, Pompey.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
    your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you
    need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
    is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
    year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more
    heads; if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest
    house in it, after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come
    to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
    hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon
    any complaint whatsoever- no, not for dwelling where you do; if I
    do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
    Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt.
    So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I
    shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.
    Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;
    The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.         Exit

ESCALUS

Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
    Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
    continued in it some time. You say seven years together?

ELBOW
2

PROVOST
ISABELLA
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
    to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward
    sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
    chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some
    piece of money, and go through with all.

ESCALUS

PROVOST
ISABELLA
Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
    most sufficient of your parish.

It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
    But there's no remedy.

JUSTICE

PROVOST
ISABELLA
Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
It is but needful:
    Mercy is not itself that oft looks so;
    Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.
    But yet, poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
    Come, sir.                                            Exeunt

Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?

Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?

PROVOST

Lest I might be too rash;

Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
    And to be shortly of a sisterhood,

ANGELO
-1
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
    And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
    If not already.

PROVOST
-1
[Going] Save your honour!

ANGELO
-1
Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
    your will?

ISABELLA
-1
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
    Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO
-1
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA
-1
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
    And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
    For which I would not plead, but that I must;
    For which I must not plead, but that I am
    At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO
-1
Well; the matter?

ISABELLA
-1
I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
    I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
    And not my brother.

PROVOST
-1
[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.

ANGELO
-1
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
    Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done;
    Mine were the very cipher of a function,
    To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
    And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA
-1
O just but severe law!
    I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
    Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
    You are too cold: if you should need a pin,
    You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
    To him, I say.

ISABELLA
-1
Must he needs die?

ANGELO
-1
Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA
-1
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
    And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO
-1
I will not do't.

ISABELLA
-1
But can you, if you would?

ANGELO
-1
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA
-1
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
    If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
    As mine is to him?

ANGELO
-1
He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] You are too cold.

ISABELLA
-1
Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
    May call it back again. Well, believe this:
    No ceremony that to great ones longs,
    Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword,
    The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe,
    Become them with one half so good a grace
    As mercy does.
    If he had been as you, and you as he,
    You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,
    Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO
-1
Pray you be gone.

ISABELLA
-1
I would to heaven I had your potency,
    And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
    No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge
    And what a prisoner.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

ANGELO
-1
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
    And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA
-1
Alas! Alas!
    Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
    And He that might the vantage best have took
    Found out the remedy. How would you be
    If He, which is the top of judgment, should
    But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
    And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
    Like man new made.

ANGELO
-1
Be you content, fair maid.
    It is the law, not I condemn your brother.
    Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
    It should be thus with him. He must die to-morrow.

ISABELLA
-1
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
    He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
    We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
    With less respect than we do minister
    To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.
    Who is it that hath died for this offence?
    There's many have committed it.

LUCIO
-1
[Aside] Ay, well said.

ANGELO
-1
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
    Those many had not dar'd to do that evil
    If the first that did th' edict infringe
    Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake,
    Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
    Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-
    Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd,
    And so in progress to be hatch'd and born-
    Are now to have no successive degrees,
    But here they live to end.

ISABELLA
-1
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO
-1
I show it most of all when I show justice;
    For then I pity those I do not know,
    Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,
    And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
    Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
    Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA
-1
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
    And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
    To have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous
    To use it like a giant.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] That's well said.

ISABELLA
-1
Could great men thunder
    As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
    For every pelting petty officer
    Would use his heaven for thunder,
    Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,
    Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,
    Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
    Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,
    Dress'd in a little brief authority,
    Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
    As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,
    Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
    He's coming; I perceive 't.

PROVOST
-1
[Aside] Pray heaven she win him.

ISABELLA
-1
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
    Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them;
    But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.

ISABELLA
-1
That in the captain's but a choleric word
    Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.

ANGELO
-1
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA
-1
Because authority, though it err like others,
    Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
    That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,
    Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
    That's like my brother's fault. If it confess
    A natural guiltiness such as is his,
    Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
    Against my brother's life.

ANGELO
-1
[Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
    Such sense that my sense breeds with it.- Fare you well.

ISABELLA
-1
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO
-1
I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.

ISABELLA
-1
Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO
-1
How, bribe me?

ISABELLA
-1
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.

ISABELLA
-1
Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
    Or stones, whose rate are either rich or poor
    As fancy values them; but with true prayers
    That shall be up at heaven and enter there
    Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
    From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate
    To nothing temporal.

ANGELO
-1
Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO
-1
[To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.

ISABELLA
-1
Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO
-1
[Aside] Amen; for I
    Am that way going to temptation
    Where prayers cross.

ISABELLA
-1
At what hour to-morrow
    Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO
-1
At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA
-1
At any time 'fore noon.

ANGELO
-1
From thee; even from thy virtue!
    What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
    The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
    Ha!
    Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I
    That, lying by the violet in the sun,
    Do as the carrion does, not as the flow'r,
    Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
    That modesty may more betray our sense
    Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
    Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
    And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
    What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
    Dost thou desire her foully for those things
    That make her good? O, let her brother live!
    Thieves for their robbery have authority
    When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
    That I desire to hear her speak again,
    And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
    O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
    With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
    Is that temptation that doth goad us on
    To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet,
    With all her double vigour, art and nature,
    Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
    Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
    When men were fond, I smil'd and wond'red how.          Exit

DUKE
-1
Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.

PROVOST
-1
I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE
-1
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
    I come to visit the afflicted spirits
    Here in the prison. Do me the common right
    To let me see them, and to make me know
    The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
    To them accordingly.

PROVOST
-1
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
                          Enter JULIET
    Look, here comes one; a gentlewoman of mine,
    Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
    Hath blister'd her report. She is with child;
    And he that got it, sentenc'd- a young man
    More fit to do another such offence
    Than die for this.

DUKE
-1
When must he die?

PROVOST
-1
As I do think, to-morrow.
    [To JULIET] I have provided for you; stay awhile
    And you shall be conducted.

DUKE
-1
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET
-1
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE
-1
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
    And try your penitence, if it be sound
    Or hollowly put on.

JULIET
-1
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE
-1
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET
-1
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE
-1
So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
    Was mutually committed.

JULIET
-1
Mutually.

DUKE
-1
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET
-1
I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE
-1
'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
    As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
    Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
    Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
    But as we stand in fear-

JULIET
-1
I do repent me as it is an evil,
    And take the shame with joy.

DUKE
-1
There rest.
    Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
    And I am going with instruction to him.
    Grace go with you! Benedicite!                          Exit

JULIET
-1
Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
    That respites me a life whose very comfort
    Is still a dying horror!

When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name,
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
    Is, like a good thing being often read,
    Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
    Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
    'Tis not the devil's crest.
                           Enter SERVANT
    How now, who's there?

One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO
-1
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ISABELLA
-1
I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO
-1
That you might know it would much better please me
    Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA
-1
Even so! Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO
-1
Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
    As long as you or I; yet he must die.

ISABELLA
-1
Under your sentence?

ANGELO
-1
Yea.

ISABELLA
-1
When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
    Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
    That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO
-1
Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
    To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n
    A man already made, as to remit
    Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
    In stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy
    Falsely to take away a life true made
    As to put metal in restrained means
    To make a false one.

ISABELLA
-1
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO
-1
Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
    Which had you rather- that the most just law
    Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
    Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
    As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA
-1
Sir, believe this:
    I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO
-1
I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
    Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA
-1
How say you?

ANGELO
-1
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
    Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
    I, now the voice of the recorded law,
    Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life;
    Might there not be a charity in sin
    To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA
-1
Please you to do't,
    I'll take it as a peril to my soul
    It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO
-1
Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
    Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA
-1
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
    Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,
    If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
    To have it added to the faults of mine,
    And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO
-1
Nay, but hear me;
    Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant
    Or seem so, craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA
-1
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
    But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO
-1
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
    When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
    Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
    Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me:
    To be received plain, I'll speak more gross-
    Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA
-1
So.

ANGELO
-1
And his offence is so, as it appears,
    Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA
-1
True.

ANGELO
-1
Admit no other way to save his life,
    As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
    But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
    Finding yourself desir'd of such a person
    Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
    Could fetch your brother from the manacles
    Of the all-binding law; and that there were
    No earthly mean to save him but that either
    You must lay down the treasures of your body
    To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-
    What would you do?

ISABELLA
-1
As much for my poor brother as myself;
    That is, were I under the terms of death,
    Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
    And strip myself to death as to a bed
    That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield
    My body up to shame.

ANGELO
-1
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA
-1
And 'twere the cheaper way:
    Better it were a brother died at once
    Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
    Should die for ever.

ANGELO
-1
Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
    That you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA
-1
Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
    Are of two houses: lawful mercy
    Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO
-1
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
    And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
    A merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA
-1
O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
    To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
    I something do excuse the thing I hate
    For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO
-1
We are all frail.

ISABELLA
-1
Else let my brother die,
    If not a fedary but only he
    Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO
-1
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA
-1
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
    Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
    Women, help heaven! Men their creation mar
    In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
    For we are soft as our complexions are,
    And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO
-1
I think it well;
    And from this testimony of your own sex,
    Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
    Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.
    I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
    That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
    If you be one, as you are well express'd
    By all external warrants, show it now
    By putting on the destin'd livery.

ISABELLA
-1
I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
    Let me intreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO
-1
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA
-1
My brother did love Juliet,
    And you tell me that he shall die for't.

ANGELO
-1
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA
-1
I know your virtue hath a license in't,
    Which seems a little fouler than it is,
    To pluck on others.

ANGELO
-1
Believe me, on mine honour,
    My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA
-1
Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
    And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
    I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't.
    Sign me a present pardon for my brother
    Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'll tell the world aloud
    What man thou art.

ANGELO
-1
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
    My unsoil'd name, th' austereness of my life,
    My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state,
    Will so your accusation overweigh
    That you shall stifle in your own report,
    And smell of calumny. I have begun,
    And now I give my sensual race the rein:
    Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
    Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
    That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
    By yielding up thy body to my will;
    Or else he must not only die the death,
    But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
    To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
    Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
    I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
    Say what you can: my false o'erweighs your true.        Exit

    Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,

    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:

Be absolute for death; either death or life
    Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.
    If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
    That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
    Servile to all the skyey influences,
    That dost this habitation where thou keep'st
    Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool;
    For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
    And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
    For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
    Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;
    For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
    Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
    And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
    Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
    For thou exists on many a thousand grains
    That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
    For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
    And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
    For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
    After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
    Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
    And Death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
    For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
    The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
    Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
    For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
    But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
    Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
    Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
    Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
    Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
    To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
    That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
    Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
    That makes these odds all even.

    In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
    As when a giant dies.

There spake my brother; there my father's grave

    Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew

Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
    To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
    This sensible warm motion to become
    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
    To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
    To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
    And blown with restless violence round about
    The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
    Of those that lawless and incertain thought
    Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.

    That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
    Can lay on nature is a paradise

Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
    sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath
    made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
    disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her,
    hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
    receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true;
    therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your
    resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die;
    go to your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO

Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
    that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE

Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
    that I will sue to be rid of it.

PROVOST
-1
What's your will, father?

DUKE
-1
That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
    with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch
    her by my company.

PROVOST
-1
That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
    with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch
    her by my company.

DUKE
-1
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
    goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness;
    but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body
    of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
    fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty
    hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How
    will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA
-1
I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
    die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how
    much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo! If ever he return, and
    I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his
    government.

DUKE
-1
That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
    he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only.
    Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in
    doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
    that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
    benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to
    your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if
    peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
    business.

ISABELLA
-1
Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE
-1
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
    heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great
    soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA
-1
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
    name.

DUKE
-1
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
    oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the
    contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
    wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
    sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:
    there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward
    her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of
    her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate
    husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA
-1
Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE
-1
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
    comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries
    of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which
    she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is
    washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA
-1
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
    the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man
    live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE
-1
It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
    not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in
    doing it.

ISABELLA
-1
Show me how, good father.

DUKE
-1
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
    first affection; his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should
    have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current,
    made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
    requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to
    the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that
    your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all
    shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
    This being granted in course- and now follows all: we shall
    advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your
    place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
    compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother
    saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and
    the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for
    his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the
    doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What
    think you of it?

ISABELLA
-1
The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
    will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE
-1
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
    Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
    promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke's; there,
    at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
    place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be
    quickly.

ISABELLA
-1
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
                                                Exeunt severally

ELBOW
-1
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs
    buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the
    world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE
-1
O heavens! what stuff is here?

POMPEY
-1
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest
    was put down, and the worser allow'd by order of law a furr'd
    gown to keep him warm; and furr'd with fox on lamb-skins too, to
    signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the
    facing.

ELBOW
-1
Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE
-1
And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
    you, sir?

ELBOW
-1
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
    to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a
    strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.

DUKE
-1
Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
    The evil that thou causest to be done,
    That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
    What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
    From such a filthy vice; say to thyself
    'From their abominable and beastly touches
    I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.'
    Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
    So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY
-1
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
    I would prove-

DUKE
-1
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
    Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer;
    Correction and instruction must both work
    Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW
-1
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.
    The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster; if he be a whoremonger,
    and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE
-1
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
    From our faults, as his faults from seeming, free.

ELBOW
-1
His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
                          Enter LUCIO

POMPEY
-1
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
    of mine.

LUCIO
-1
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
    thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,
    newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the
    pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st
    thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th'
    last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was,
    man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
    trick of it?

DUKE
-1
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO
-1
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
    ha?

POMPEY
-1
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
    herself in the tub.

LUCIO
-1
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
    your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd
    consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?

POMPEY
-1
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO
-1
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
    thither. For debt, Pompey- or how?

ELBOW
-1
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO
-1
Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
    bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of
    antiquity, too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to
    the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
    will keep the house.

POMPEY
-1
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO
-1
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will
    pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not
    patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu trusty Pompey.
    Bless you, friar.

DUKE
-1
And you.

LUCIO
-1
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW
-1
Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY
-1
You will not bail me then, sir?

LUCIO
-1
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?

ELBOW
-1
Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO
-1
Go to kennel, Pompey, go.

DUKE
-1
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO
-1
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
    in Rome; but where is he, think you?

DUKE
-1
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO
-1
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
    state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo
    dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.

DUKE
-1
He does well in't.

LUCIO
-1
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
    something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE
-1
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO
-1
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
    well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till
    eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not
    made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it
    true, think you?

DUKE
-1
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO
-1
Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
    between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes
    water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he
    is a motion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE
-1
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO
-1
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
    of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that
    is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the
    getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a
    thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service,
    and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE
-1
I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
    not inclin'd that way.

LUCIO
-1
O, sir, you are deceiv'd.

DUKE
-1
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO
-1
Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
    was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in
    him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.

DUKE
-1
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO
-1
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
    I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.

DUKE
-1
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO
-1
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
    and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file
    of the subject held the Duke to be wise.

DUKE
-1
Wise? Why, no question but he was.

LUCIO
-1
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE
-1
Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
    stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a
    warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but
    testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to
    the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you
    speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much
    dark'ned in your malice.

LUCIO
-1
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE
-1
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
    love.

LUCIO
-1
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE
-1
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
    But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me
    desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
    have spoke, you have courage to maintain it; I am bound to call
    upon you; and I pray you your name?

LUCIO
-1
Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

DUKE
-1
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.

LUCIO
-1
I fear you not.

DUKE
-1
O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me
    too unhurtful an opposite. But, indeed, I can do you little harm:
    you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO
-1
I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no
    more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE
-1
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO
-1
Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke
    we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent will
    unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in
    his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would
    have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to
    light. Would he were return'd! Marry, this Claudio is condemned
    for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee pray for me. The
    Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not
    past it yet; and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar
    though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.
    Farewell.                                               Exit

DUKE
-1
No might nor greatness in mortality
    Can censure scape; back-wounding calumny
    The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
    Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
    But who comes here?
             Enter ESCALUS, PROVOST, and OFFICERS with
                           MISTRESS OVERDONE

ESCALUS
-1
Go, away with her to prison.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is
    accounted a merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS
-1
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the
    same kind! This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.

PROVOST
-1
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please your
    honour.

MRS
-1
OVERDONE. My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
    Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke's time;
    he promis'd her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old
    come Philip and Jacob; I have kept it myself; and see how he goes
    about to abuse me.

ESCALUS
-1
That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be call'd
    before us. Away with her to prison. Go to; no more words. [Exeunt
    OFFICERS with MISTRESS OVERDONE]  Provost, my brother Angelo will
    not be alter'd: Claudio must die to-morrow. Let him be furnish'd
    with divines, and have all charitable preparation. If my brother
    wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.

PROVOST
-1
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advis'd
    him for th' entertainment of death.

ESCALUS
-1
Good even, good father.

DUKE
-1
Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS
-1
Of whence are you?

DUKE
-1
Not of this country, though my chance is now
    To use it for my time. I am a brother
    Of gracious order, late come from the See
    In special business from his Holiness.

ESCALUS
-1
What news abroad i' th' world?

DUKE
-1
None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
    dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and,
    as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
    virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce
    truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough
    to make fellowships accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the
    wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every
    day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

ESCALUS
-1
One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to
    know himself.

DUKE
-1
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS
-1
Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
    anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all
    temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they
    may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find
    Claudio prepar'd. I am made to understand that you have lent him
    visitation.

DUKE
-1
He professes to have received no sinister measure from his
    judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
    justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
    frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good
    leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.

ESCALUS
-1
You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner
    the very debt of your calling. I have labour'd for the poor
    gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother
    justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him
    he is indeed Justice.

DUKE
-1
If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it
    shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath
    sentenc'd himself.

ESCALUS
-1
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE
-1
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

MARIANA
-1
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away;
    Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice

DUKE
-1
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
    To make bad good and good provoke to harm.
    I pray you tell me hath anybody inquir'd for me here to-day. Much
    upon this time have I promis'd here to meet.

MARIANA
-1
You have not been inquir'd after; I have sat here all day.
                         Enter ISABELLA

DUKE
-1
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I
    shall crave your forbearance a little. May be I will call upon
    you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA
-1
I am always bound to you.                        Exit

DUKE
-1
Very well met, and well come.
    What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA
-1
He hath a garden circummur'd with brick,
    Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
    And to that vineyard is a planched gate
    That makes his opening with this bigger key;
    This other doth command a little door
    Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.
    There have I made my promise
    Upon the heavy middle of the night
    To call upon him.

DUKE
-1
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA
-1
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't;
    With whispering and most guilty diligence,
    In action all of precept, he did show me
    The way twice o'er.

DUKE
-1
Are there no other tokens
    Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA
-1
No, none, but only a repair i' th' dark;
    And that I have possess'd him my most stay
    Can be but brief; for I have made him know
    I have a servant comes with me along,
    That stays upon me; whose persuasion is
    I come about my brother.

DUKE
-1
'Tis well borne up.
    I have not yet made known to Mariana
    A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.
                       Enter MARIANA
    I pray you be acquainted with this maid;
    She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA
-1
I do desire the like.

DUKE
-1
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA
-1
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE
-1
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
    Who hath a story ready for your ear.
    I shall attend your leisure; but make haste;
    The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA
-1
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE
-1
O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes
    Are stuck upon thee. Volumes of report
    Run with these false, and most contrarious quest
    Upon thy doings. Thousand escapes of wit
    Make thee the father of their idle dream,
    And rack thee in their fancies.
                 Enter MARIANA and ISABELLA
    Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA
-1
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
    If you advise it.

DUKE
-1
It is not my consent,
    But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA
-1
Little have you to say,
    When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
    'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA
-1
Fear me not.

DUKE
-1
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
    He is your husband on a pre-contract.
    To bring you thus together 'tis no sin,
    Sith that the justice of your title to him
    Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go;
    Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.       Exeunt

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
    married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never cut of a
    woman's head.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Come, sir, leave me your snatches and yield me a direct
    answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here
    is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a
    helper; if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem
    you from your gyves; if not, you shall have your full time of
    imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for
    you have been a notorious bawd.

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet
    I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to
    receive some instructions from my fellow partner.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
What ho, Abhorson! Where's Abhorson there?
                          Enter ABHORSON

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
PROVOST
Do you call, sir?

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your
    execution. If you think it meet, compound with him by the year,
    and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present,
    and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath
    been a bawd.

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
PROVOST
A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit our mystery.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn the
    scale.                                                  Exit

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
Pray, sir, by your good favour- for surely, sir, a good
    favour you have but that you have a hanging look- do you call,
    sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
PROVOST
Ay, sir; a mystery.

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your
    whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do
    prove my occupation a mystery; but what mystery there should be
    in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
PROVOST
Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
Proof?

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
PROVOST
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be too
    little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it
    be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough; so
    every true man's apparel fits your thief.
                          Enter PROVOST

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Are you agreed?

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more
    penitent trade than your bawd; he doth oftener ask forgiveness.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe to-morrow
    four o'clock.

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
PROVOST
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion
    to use me for your own turn, you shall find me yare; for truly,
    sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn.

PROVOST
0
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.

CLAUDIO
0
PROVOST
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
    When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.
    He will not wake.

PROVOST
-1
Who can do good on him?
    Well, go, prepare yourself. [Knocking within] But hark, what
      noise?

DUKE
-1
The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night
    Envelop you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

PROVOST
-1
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE
-1
Not Isabel?

PROVOST
-1
No.

DUKE
-1
They will then, ere't be long.

PROVOST
-1
What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE
-1
There's some in hope.

PROVOST
-1
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE
-1
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
    Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
    He doth with holy abstinence subdue
    That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
    To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that
    Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
    But this being so, he's just. [Knocking within] Now are they

PROVOST
-1
There he must stay until the officer
    Arise to let him in; he is call'd up.

DUKE
-1
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
    But he must die to-morrow?

PROVOST
-1
None, sir, none.

DUKE
-1
As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,
    You shall hear more ere morning.

PROVOST
-1
Happily
    You something know; yet I believe there comes
    No countermand; no such example have we.
    Besides, upon the very siege of justice,
    Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
    Profess'd the contrary.
                         Enter a MESSENGER
    This is his lordship's man.

DUKE
-1
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

MESSENGER
-1
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further
    charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it,
    neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for
    as I take it, it is almost day.

PROVOST
-1
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further
    charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it,
    neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for
    as I take it, it is almost day.

DUKE
-1
[Aside] This is his pardon, purchas'd by such sin
    For which the pardoner himself is in;
    Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
    When it is borne in high authority.
    When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended
    That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.
    Now, sir, what news?

PROVOST
-1
I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine
    office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks
    strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.

DUKE
-1
Pray you, let's hear.

PROVOST
-1
[Reads] 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
    Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and, in the afternoon,
    Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's
    head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought
    that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not
    to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
    What say you to this, sir?

DUKE
-1
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th'
    afternoon?

PROVOST
-1
A Bohemian born; but here nurs'd up and bred.
    One that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE
-1
How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him
    to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his
    manner to do so.

PROVOST
-1
His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,
    his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to
    an undoubted proof.

DUKE
-1
It is now apparent?

PROVOST
-1
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE
-1
Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to
    be touch'd?

PROVOST
-1
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
    drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past,
    present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately
    mortal.

DUKE
-1
He wants advice.

PROVOST
-1
He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the
    prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many
    times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft
    awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a
    seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE
-1
More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost,
    honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill
    beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself
    in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no
    greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To
    make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four
    days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
    a dangerous courtesy.

PROVOST
-1
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE
-1
In the delaying death.

PROVOST
-1
Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an
    express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view
    of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the
    smallest.

DUKE
-1
By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions
    may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,
    and his head borne to Angelo.

PROVOST
-1
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE
-1
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave
    the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the
    penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is
    common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
    good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against
    it with my life.

PROVOST
-1
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE
-1
Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy?

PROVOST
-1
To him and to his substitutes.

DUKE
-1
You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch
    the justice of your dealing?

PROVOST
-1
But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE
-1
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you
    fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can
    with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck
    all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of
    the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is
    not strange to you.

PROVOST
-1
I know them both.

DUKE
-1
The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall
    anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within
    these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows
    not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,
    perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some
    monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th'
    unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into
    amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but
    easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with
    Barnardine's head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise
    him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall
    absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of
    profession; one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own
    house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
    Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
    ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
    marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
    for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
    Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
    suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
    Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
    man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
    traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
    forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the
    Lord's sake.'

DUKE
-1
Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!
    After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

PROVOST
-1
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE
-1
A creature unprepar'd, unmeet for death;
    And to transport him in the mind he is
    Were damnable.

PROVOST
-1
Here in the prison, father,
    There died this morning of a cruel fever
    One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
    A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
    Just of his colour. What if we do omit
    This reprobate till he were well inclin'd,
    And satisfy the deputy with the visage
    Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE
-1
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
    Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
    Prefix'd by Angelo. See this be done,
    And sent according to command; whiles I
    Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

PROVOST
-1
This shall be done, good father, presently.
    But Barnardine must die this afternoon;
    And how shall we continue Claudio,
    To save me from the danger that might come
    If he were known alive?

DUKE
-1
Let this be done:
    Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio.
    Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
    To the under generation, you shall find
    Your safety manifested.

PROVOST
-1
I am your free dependant.

DUKE
-1
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.

PROVOST
-1
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE
-1
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
    For I would commune with you of such things
    That want no ear but yours.

PROVOST

I'll make all speed.                             Exit

    To make her heavenly comforts of despair
    When it is least expected.

ISABELLA
-1
Ho, by your leave!

DUKE
-1
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA
-1
The better, given me by so holy a man.
    Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE
-1
He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world.
    His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA
-1
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE
-1
It is no other.
    Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience,

O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE
-1
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA

Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
    Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!

DUKE
-1
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
    Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.
    Mark what I say, which you shall find
    By every syllable a faithful verity.
    The Duke comes home to-morrow. Nay, dry your eyes.
    One of our covent, and his confessor,
    Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried
    Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
    Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
    There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom
    In that good path that I would wish it go,
    And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
    Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,
    And general honour.

-1
I am directed by you.

DUKE
-1
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
    'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
    Say, by this token, I desire his company
    At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
    I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
    Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
    Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
    I am combined by a sacred vow,
    And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
    Command these fretting waters from your eyes
    With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
    If I pervert your course. Who's here?

-1
Good even. Friar, where's the Provost?

DUKE
-1
Not within, sir.

LUCIO

O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
    so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
    water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
    fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
    here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
    old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had

DUKE
-1
Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;
    but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO

Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a
    better woodman than thou tak'st him for.

DUKE
-1
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO
-1
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty
    tales of the Duke.

DUKE
-1
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be
    true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO
-1
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE
-1
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO
-1
Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would
    else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE
-1
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO
-1
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy
    talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a

In brief- to set the needless process by,
    How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
    How he refell'd me, and how I replied,
    For this was of much length- the vile conclusion
    I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
    He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
    To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
    Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
    My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
    And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
    His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
    For my poor brother's head.

DUKE

ANGELO
ESCALUS
LORDS
By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
    Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
    In hateful practice. First, his integrity
    Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
    That with such vehemency he should pursue
    Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,
    He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
    And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;
    Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
    Thou cam'st here to complain.

ISABELLA

LORDS
And is this all?
    Then, O you blessed ministers above,
    Keep me in patience; and, with ripened time,
    Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
    In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
    As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE

ANGELO
ESCALUS
LORDS
I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
    To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
    A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
    On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
    Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA

One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE

A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO

ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
LORDS
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar.
    I do not like the man; had he been lay, my lord,
    For certain words he spake against your Grace
    In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
ESCALUS

Words against me? This's a good friar, belike!
    And to set on this wretched woman here
    Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO

ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
LORDS
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
    I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar,
    A very scurvy fellow.

PETER

ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
LORDS
Blessed be your royal Grace!
    I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
    Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman
    Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;
    Who is as free from touch or soil with her
    As she from one ungot.

DUKE

LORDS
We did believe no less.
    Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

PETER

ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
LORDS
I know him for a man divine and holy;
    Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
    As he's reported by this gentleman;
    And, on my trust, a man that never yet
    Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.

My lord, most villainously; believe it.

PETER

Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
    But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
    Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request-
    Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
    Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither
    To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
    Is true and false; and what he, with his oath
    And all probation, will make up full clear,
    Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman-
    To justify this worthy nobleman,
    So vulgarly and personally accus'd-
    Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
    Till she herself confess it.

Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife.

My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither

This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS

Now I come to't, my lord:
    She that accuses him of fornication,
    In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
    And charges him, my lord, with such a time
    When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,
    With all th' effect of love.

ANGELO
2
ESCALUS

Charges she moe than me?

MARIANA

Not that I know.

DUKE

No? You say your husband.

MARIANA
2
ANGELO

Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
    Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
    But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO

ESCALUS
LORDS
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA

My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
                                                     [Unveiling]
    This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
    Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on;
    This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
    Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
    That took away the match from Isabel,
    And did supply thee at thy garden-house
    In her imagin'd person.

DUKE

Know you this woman?

Sirrah, no more.

LUCIO

Enough, my lord.

ANGELO
2
ESCALUS
LORDS
My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
    And five years since there was some speech of marriage
    Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
    Partly for that her promised proportions
    Came short of composition; but in chief
    For that her reputation was disvalued
    In levity. Since which time of five years
    I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
    Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
LORDS
Noble Prince,
    As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
    As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
    I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
    As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
    But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house,
    He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
    Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
    Or else for ever be confixed here,
    A marble monument!

ANGELO
2
ESCALUS
LORDS
I did but smile till now.
    Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
    My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
    These poor informal women are no more
    But instruments of some more mightier member
    That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,
    To find this practice out.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
LORDS
Ay, with my heart;
    And punish them to your height of pleasure.
    Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
    Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
    Though they would swear down each particular saint,
    Were testimonies against his worth and credit,
    That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
    Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
    To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd.
    There is another friar that set them on;
    Let him be sent for.

PETER
2
ANGELO

Would lie were here, my lord! For he indeed
    Hath set the women on to this complaint.

    Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
    Do with your injuries as seems you best

    enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable

Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS

Say you?

LUCIO

Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would
    sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.

    you.

LUCIO
1

Come, sir; did you set these women on to slander Lord
    Angelo? They have confess'd you did.

DUKE

'Tis false.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
LORDS
How! Know you where you are?

DUKE
1
ANGELO

Respect to your great place! and let the devil
    Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
    Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
LORDS
The Duke's in us; and we will hear you speak;
    Look you speak justly.

DUKE
1
ANGELO
LORDS
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
    Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox,
    Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
    Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust
    Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
    And put your trial in the villain's mouth
    Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO
1
ANGELO
LORDS
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
LORDS
Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
    Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
    To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,
    And in the witness of his proper ear,
    To call him villain; and then to glance from him
    To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
    Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you
    Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
    What, 'unjust'!

DUKE
1
ANGELO
LORDS
Be not so hot; the Duke
    Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
    Dare rack his own; his subject am I not,
    Nor here provincial. My business in this state
    Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,
    Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
    Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults,
    But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes
    Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
    As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
LORDS
Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO
1
LORDS
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
    Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO
1
ANGELO
LORDS
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, good-man bald-pate.
    Do you know me?

DUKE
1
ANGELO
LORDS
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at
    the prison, in the absence of the Duke.

LUCIO
1
ANGELO
LORDS
O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?

DUKE
1
ANGELO
LORDS
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO
1
ANGELO
LORDS
Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and
    a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE
1
ANGELO
LORDS
You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my
    report; you, indeed, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse.

LUCIO
1
ANGELO

O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for
    thy speeches?

DUKE
1

Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable
    abuses!

ESCALUS

Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal. Away with him to
    prison! Where is the Provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts
    enough upon him; let him speak no more. Away with those giglets
    too, and with the other confederate companion!
                            [The PROVOST lays bands on the DUKE]

    bald-pated lying rascal, you must be hooded, must you? Show your
    knave's visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face,

[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down.
    We'll borrow place of him. [To ANGELO] Sir, by your leave.
    Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
    That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
    Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
    And hold no longer out.

ANGELO

LORDS
O my dread lord,
    I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
    To think I can be undiscernible,
    When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine,
    Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good Prince,
    No longer session hold upon my shame,
    But let my trial be mine own confession;
    Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,
    Is all the grace I beg.

    Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
    And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
    Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
    Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
    Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
    It was the swift celerity of his death,
    Which I did think with slower foot came on,
    That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!
    That life is better life, past fearing death,
    Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
    So happy is your brother.

DUKE
0
LORDS
For this new-married man approaching here,
    Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
    Your well-defended honour, you must pardon
    For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother-
    Being criminal in double violation
    Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach,
    Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-
    The very mercy of the law cries out
    Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
    'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
    Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
    Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.
    Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
    Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
    We do condemn thee to the very block
    Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
    Away with him!

MARIANA

DUKE

It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
    Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
    I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
    For that he knew you, might reproach your life,

    Although by confiscation they are ours,
    We do instate and widow you withal
    To buy you a better husband.

Isabel,
    Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
    Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
    They say best men moulded out of faults;
    And, for the most, become much more the better
    For being a little bad; so may my husband.
    O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

ISABELLA

[Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,
    Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
    As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
    A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
    Till he did look on me; since it is so,
    Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
    In that he did the thing for which he died;
    For Angelo,
    His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
    And must be buried but as an intent
    That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
    Intents but merely thoughts.

PROVOST

    I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;

    For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
    That should by private order else have died,
    I have reserv'd alive.

This is another prisoner that I sav'd,
    Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
    As like almost to Claudio as himself.    [Unmuffles CLAUDIO]

[To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
    Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
    Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
    He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
    By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
    Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.
    Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
    Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
    I find an apt remission in myself;
    And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
    To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
    One all of luxury, an ass, a madman!
    Wherein have I so deserv'd of you
    That you extol me thus?

Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick.
    If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would
    please you I might be whipt.

Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.
    Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,
    If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow-
    As I have heard him swear himself there's one
    Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
    And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd,
    Let him be whipt and hang'd.

I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your
    Highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not
    recompense me in making me a cuckold.

Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
    Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
    Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
    And see our pleasure herein executed.

Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping,
    and hanging.

Slandering a prince deserves it.
