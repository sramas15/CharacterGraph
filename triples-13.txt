One, certes, that promises no element
BUCKINGHAM

I pray you, who, my lord?
NORFOLK
0
All this was ord'red by the good discretion
BUCKINGHAM
0
The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
NORFOLK
0
Surely, sir,
ABERGAVENNY
0
I cannot tell
BUCKINGHAM

Why the devil,
ABERGAVENNY
0
I do know
BUCKINGHAM

O, many
NORFOLK

Grievingly I think
BUCKINGHAM

Every man,

Which is budded out;
ABERGAVENNY
0
Is it therefore
NORFOLK
0
Marry, is't.
ABERGAVENNY

A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd
BUCKINGHAM
0
Why, all this business

WOLSEY
0
Is he in person ready?
SECRETARY
0
Ay, please your Grace.
WOLSEY
0
Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham
BUCKINGHAM

This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I

I read in's looks
NORFOLK

Stay, my lord,
BUCKINGHAM
0
I'll to the King,

Sir,

Say not treasonous.
BUCKINGHAM
0
To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong
NORFOLK
0
Faith, and so it did.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal
NORFOLK
0
I am sorry
BUCKINGHAM
0
No, not a syllable:
BRANDON
0
Your office, sergeant: execute it.
SERGEANT
0
Sir,
BUCKINGHAM
0
Lo you, my lord,
BRANDON
0
I am sorry
BUCKINGHAM
0
It will help nothing
BRANDON

Nay, he must bear you company.

So, so!

Please you, sir,
QUEEN KATHARINE

No, my lord!

By my life,

Things done well
WOLSEY

[Aside to the SECRETARY]  A word with you.
QUEEN KATHARINE

I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
KING

It grieves many.
WOLSEY

Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,

First, it was usual with him-every day

Please your Highness, note

0
My learn'd Lord Cardinal,

Speak on.
SURVEYOR
0
He was brought to this

How know'st thou this?
SURVEYOR
0
Not long before your Highness sped to France,
QUEEN KATHARINE
0
If I know you well,
KING
0
Let him on.
SURVEYOR
0
On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
KING
0
Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
SURVEYOR
0
I can, my liege.
KING
0
Proceed.
SURVEYOR
0
Being at Greenwich,
KING
0
I remember
SURVEYOR
0
'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-
KING

A giant traitor!
WOLSEY

Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
QUEEN KATHARINE
0
God mend all!
KING
0
There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?
SURVEYOR

After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,'
KING
0
There's his period,
CHAMBERLAIN
0
Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
SANDYS

New customs,
CHAMBERLAIN

As far as I see, all the good our English
SANDYS

They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,
CHAMBERLAIN
0
Death! my lord,
LOVELL
0
Faith, my lord,
CHAMBERLAIN
0
What is't for?
LOVELL
0
The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
CHAMBERLAIN

They must either,
SANDYS

'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases

You are a merry gamester,

Yes, if I make my play.

You cannot show me.

I told your Grace they would talk anon.
WOLSEY

SECOND GENTLEMAN

FIRST GENTLEMAN

You may guess quickly what.
SECOND GENTLEMAN

Is he found guilty?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
SERVANT

Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
SECOND GENTLEMAN

I am sorry for't.

So are a number more.

But, pray, how pass'd it?
FIRST GENTLEMAN

I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke.
SECOND GENTLEMAN

That was he
FIRST GENTLEMAN

After all this, how did he bear him-self
FIRST GENTLEMAN

When he was brought again to th' bar to hear
SECOND GENTLEMAN

I do not think he fears death.

All good people,
LOVELL
3
SERVANT
ANNE

I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
BUCKINGHAM
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
LOVELL
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
To th' water side I must conduct your Grace;
VAUX
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
Prepare there;
BUCKINGHAM
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
Nay, Sir Nicholas,
BUCKINGHAM
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!
                                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train
FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
SERVANT
ANNE

O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
SECOND GENTLEMAN

If the Duke be guiltless,

Good angels keep it from us!

This secret is so weighty, 'twill require

I am confident.
FIRST GENTLEMAN

Yes, but it held not;
SECOND GENTLEMAN

But that slander, sir,
FIRST GENTLEMAN

'Tis the Cardinal;

I think you have hit the mark; but is't

What should this mean?

What should this mean?
    What sudden anger's this? How have I reap'd it?
    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
    Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion
    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-
    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
    This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account
    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
    For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,
    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
    Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
    Made me put this main secret in the packet
    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
