                 KING HENRY THE EIGHTH
                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
  BUCKINGHAM.

DUKE OF NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
  NORFOLK. 
1
DUKE OF NORFOLK
RFOLK. I thank your Grace,

DUKE OF NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
1
DUKE OF NORFOLK

  BUCKINGHAM.

  BUCKINGHAM.

  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
DUKE OF NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
1
DUKE OF NORFOLK
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM.

2
CARDINAL WOLSEY
DUKE OF NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

SIR THOMAS LOVELL
LORD CHAMBERLAIN
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.

        Orpheus with his lute made trees,
        And the mountain tops that freeze,
          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,
        Killing care and grief of heart
          Fall asleep or hearing die.

    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,

LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

DUKE OF NORFOLK

  NORFOLK. 
2
CARDINAL WOLSEY
DUKE OF NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

                    SONG
        Orpheus with his lute made trees,
        And the mountain tops that freeze,
          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,
        Killing care and grief of heart
          Fall asleep or hearing die.

    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
    This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account
    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
    For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,
    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
    Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
    Made me put this main secret in the packet
    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting. I shall fall

    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

                 KING HENRY THE EIGHTH
                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

CKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done

1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. I thank your Grace,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Who did guide-
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
1
NORFOLK
ERGAVENNY. I cannot tell

NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
  NORFOLK. 
2
WOLSEY
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

        Orpheus with his lute made trees,

          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,

          Fall asleep or hearing die.

LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

                 KING HENRY THE EIGHTH
                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

CKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done

1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. I thank your Grace,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Who did guide-
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
1
NORFOLK
ERGAVENNY. I cannot tell
  BUCKINGHAM.

1

NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
  NORFOLK. 
2
WOLSEY
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,

LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

                 KING HENRY THE EIGHTH
                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

CKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done

1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. I thank your Grace,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Who did guide-
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
1
NORFOLK
ERGAVENNY. I cannot tell
  BUCKINGHAM.

1

NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
  NORFOLK. 
2
WOLSEY
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,

LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

                 KING HENRY THE EIGHTH
                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

CKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done

1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. I thank your Grace,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Who did guide-
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
1
NORFOLK
ERGAVENNY. I cannot tell
  BUCKINGHAM.

1

NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
  NORFOLK. 
2
WOLSEY
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,

LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

                 KING HENRY THE EIGHTH
                     THE PROLOGUE.
    I come no more to make you laugh; things now
    That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
    Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
    Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
    We now present. Those that can pity here
    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:
    The subject will deserve it. Such as give
    Their money out of hope they may believe
    May here find truth too. Those that come to see
    Only a show or two, and so agree
    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
    I'll undertake may see away their shilling
    Richly in two short hours. Only they
    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,
    To rank our chosen truth with such a show
    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
    To make that only true we now intend,
    Will leave us never an understanding friend.
    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
    The first and happiest hearers of the town,
    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
    The very persons of our noble story
    As they were living; think you see them great,
    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
    How soon this mightiness meets misery.
    And if you can be merry then, I'll say
    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

CKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done

1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. I thank your Grace,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Who did guide-
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM. 
1
NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
  NORFOLK. 
1
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
1
NORFOLK
ERGAVENNY. I cannot tell
  BUCKINGHAM.

1

NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
  NORFOLK. 
2
WOLSEY
NORFOLK
RFOLK. Like it your Grace,
    The state takes notice of the private difference
    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
    The Cardinal's malice and his potency
    Together; to consider further, that
    What his high hatred would effect wants not
    A minister in his power. You know his nature,
    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
    That I advise your shunning.

NORFOLK
CKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

          Bow themselves when he did sing;
        To his music plants and flowers
        Ever sprung, as sun and showers
          There had made a lasting spring.
        Every thing that heard him play,
        Even the billows of the sea,
          Hung their heads and then lay by.
        In sweet music is such art,

LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory;
    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
    At length broke under me, and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.

0
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. Who did guide-
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
0
ERGAVENNY. I cannot tell
  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. Why the devil,
  ABERGAVENNY. 
0
ERGAVENNY. I do know
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. O, many
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Grievingly I think

CKINGHAM. Every man,

ERGAVENNY. Is it therefore

RFOLK. Marry, is't.

  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. Sir,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Say not treasonous.
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Faith, and so it did.
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. I am sorry
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. No, not a syllable:
  BRANDON. 
0
ANDON. Your office, sergeant: execute it.
  SERGEANT. 
0
RGEANT. Sir,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. Lo you, my lord,

ANDON. I am sorry
  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. It will help nothing
  BRANDON.

ANDON. Nay, he must bear you company.

NG. Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. Thank your Majesty.
  KING. 
0
NG. Lady mine, proceed.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. I am solicited, not by a few,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Not almost appears-
  KING.

NG. Taxation!
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Please you, sir,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. No, my lord!
  KING. 
0
NG. Still exaction!
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. I am much too venturous
  KING. 
0
NG. By my life,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. And for me,
  KING. 
0
NG. Things done well
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. [Aside to the SECRETARY]  A word with you.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
  KING. 
0
NG. It grieves many.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
  KING. 
0
NG. Speak freely.
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. First, it was usual with him-every day
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Please your Highness, note
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. My learn'd Lord Cardinal,
  KING. 
0
NG. Speak on.
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. He was brought to this
  KING. 
0
NG. What was that Henton?
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. Sir, a Chartreux friar,
  KING. 
0
NG. How know'st thou this?
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. Not long before your Highness sped to France,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. If I know you well,
  KING. 
0
NG. Let him on.
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
  KING. 
0
NG. Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. I can, my liege.
  KING. 
0
NG. Proceed.
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. Being at Greenwich,
  KING. 
0
NG. I remember
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. 'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-
  KING. 
0
NG. A giant traitor!
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. God mend all!
  KING. 
0
NG. There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,'
  KING. 
0
NG. There's his period,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. New customs,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Death! my lord,
  LOVELL. 
0
VELL. Faith, my lord,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. What is't for?
  LOVELL. 
0
VELL. The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. I am glad 'tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs
  LOVELL. 
0
VELL. They must either,
  SANDYS.

  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. What a loss our ladies
  LOVELL. 
0
VELL. Ay, marry,
  SANDYS. 
0

NDYS. No, my lord,
  CHAMBERLAIN.

AMBERLAIN. O, 'tis true;

VELL. That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
  CHAMBERLAIN.

AMBERLAIN. No doubt he's noble;

NDYS. He may, my lord; has wherewithal. In him
  CHAMBERLAIN.

AMBERLAIN. True, they are so;

VELL. O that your lordship were but now confessor
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. I would I were;
  LOVELL. 
0
VELL. Faith, how easy?
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. As easy as a down bed would afford it.
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. By my faith,
  ANNE. 
0
NE. Was he mad, sir?
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too.
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Well said, my lord.
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. For my little cure,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Y'are welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. Your Grace is noble.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. My Lord Sandys,
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. The red wine first must rise
  ANNE. 
0
NE. You are a merry gamester,
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. Yes, if I make my play.
  ANNE. 
0
NE. You cannot show me.
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. I told your Grace they would talk anon.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. What's that?
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Look out there, some of ye.             Exit a SERVANT
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. What warlike voice,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. How now! what is't?
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. A noble troop of strangers-
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Good Lord Chamberlain,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Say, Lord Chamberlain,
  KING. 
0
NG. The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. My lord!
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Your Grace?
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Pray tell 'em thus much from me:
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. I will, my lord.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. What say they?
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Such a one, they all confess,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Let me see, then.                    [Comes from his state]
  KING. 
0
NG.  [Unmasking]  Ye have found him, Cardinal.
  WOLSEY.

  FIRST

  FIRST

  SECOND 
0

  FIRST

  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. That was he
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. The same.
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. After all this, how did he bear him-self
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. When he was brought again to th' bar to hear
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. I do not think he fears death.
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. Sure, he does not;
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. Certainly
  FIRST

  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
  SECOND

  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. Good angels keep it from us!
  SECOND

COND GENTLEMAN. This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
  FIRST 
0

  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. I am confident.
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. Yes, but it held not;
  SECOND

  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. I left him private,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. What's the cause?
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. No, his conscience
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. 'Tis so;
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. How holily he works in all his business!
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. And free us from his slavery.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. We had need pray, and heartily, for our deliverance;
  SUFFOLK.

  NORFOLK.

RFOLK. Let's in;
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Excuse me,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.
  KING.

NG. Who's there, ha?
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Pray God he be not angry.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves
  NORFOLK.

  KING.

  WOLSEY.

LSEY. Yes, he was.
  CAMPEIUS. 
0
MPEIUS. Was he not held a learned man?
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Yes, surely.
  CAMPEIUS. 
0
MPEIUS. Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then,
  WOLSEY.

  ANNE.

D LADY. Hearts of most hard temper
  ANNE. 
0
NE. O, God's will! much better
  OLD 
0
D LADY. Alas, poor lady!
  ANNE. 
0
NE. So much the more
  OLD 
0
D LADY. Our content
  ANNE. 
0
NE. By my troth and maidenhead,
  OLD 
0
D LADY. Beshrew me, I would,
  ANNE. 
0
NE. Nay, good troth.
  OLD 
0
D LADY. Yes, troth and troth. You would not be a queen!
  ANNE. 
0
NE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.
  OLD 
0
D LADY. 'Tis strange: a threepence bow'd would hire me,
  ANNE. 
0
NE. No, in truth.
  OLD

EEN KATHARINE. Ye tell me what ye wish for both-my ruin.

RREY. Sir,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Believe it, this is true:
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. How came
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Most Strangely.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. O, how, how?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried,
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Has the King this?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Believe it.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Will this work?
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. The King in this perceives him how he coasts
  SURREY.

RREY. Would he had!
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. May you be happy in your wish, my lord!
  SURREY.

  NORFOLK.

RFOLK. Marry, amen!
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. No, no;
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Now, God incense him,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. But, my lord,
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. He is return'd in his opinions; which
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. This same Cranmer's
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. He has; and we shall see him
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. So I hear.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. 'Tis so.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Observe, observe, he's moody.

OMWELL. Presently
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Is he ready
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. I think by this he is.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Leave me awhile.                              Exit CROMWELL
  NORFOLK.

RFOLK. He's discontented.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. May be he hears the King
  SURREY.

RREY. Sharp enough,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY.  [Aside]  The late Queen's gentlewoman, a knight's
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. He is vex'd at something.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. I would 'twere something that would fret the string,
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. The King, the King!
  KING. 
0
NG. What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. My lord, we have
  KING. 
0
NG. It may well be
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. It's heaven's will;
  KING. 
0
NG. If we did think
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Heaven forgive me!
  KING. 
0
NG. Good, my lord,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Sir,
  KING. 
0
NG. You have said well.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. And ever may your Highness yoke together,
  KING. 
0
NG. 'Tis well said again;
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY.  [Aside]  What should this mean?
  SURREY. 
0
RREY.  [Aside]  The Lord increase this business!
  KING. 
0
NG. Have I not made you
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
  KING. 
0
NG. Fairly answer'd!
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. I do profess
  KING. 
0
NG. 'Tis nobly spoken.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. What should this mean?
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Stay:
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Who dares cross 'em,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Till I find more than will or words to do it-
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. The King, that gave it.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. It must be himself then.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Proud lord, thou liest.
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Thy ambition,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. This, and all else
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. By my soul,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. All goodness
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Yes, that goodness
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand;
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. So much fairer
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. This cannot save you.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Speak on, sir;
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Then, that without the knowledge
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Item, you sent a large commission
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. That out of mere ambition you have caus'd
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. Then, that you have sent innumerable substance,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. O my lord,
  SURREY. 
0
RREY. I forgive him.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. I have no power to speak, sir.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. What, amaz'd
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. How does your Grace?
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Why, well;
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. The heaviest and the worst
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. God bless him!
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. That's somewhat sudden.
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. That's news indeed.
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. Last, that the Lady Anne,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. There was the weight that pull'd me down.
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. O my lord,
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
  CROMWELL. 
0
OMWELL. Good sir, have patience.
  WOLSEY.

0
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!

0
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?

0
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM.

  ABERGAVENNY.

NG. How know'st thou this?
  SURVEYOR. 
0

0
RVEYOR. On my soul, I'll speak but truth.

  SURVEYOR.

LSEY. Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. God mend all!
  KING. 
0
NG. There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,'
  KING. 
0
NG. There's his period,

AMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
  SANDYS.

  LOVELL. 
3
SERVANT

VELL. I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
  LOVELL.

SERVANT

GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

  SURREY. 
5
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

  SUFFOLK. 
5
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING
FFOLK. The King, the King!
  KING. 
5
SERVANT
WOLSEY

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING
NG. You have said well.

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING
LSEY. My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,

5
SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
KING

  KING. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
NG. 'Tis nobly spoken.
    Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
    For you have seen him open 't. Read o'er this;
                                                  [Giving him papers]
    And after, this; and then to breakfast with
    What appetite you have.
                Exit the KING, frowning upon the CARDINAL; the NOBLES
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. What should this mean?
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. What should this mean?
    What sudden anger's this? How have I reap'd it?
    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
    Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion
    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-
    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
    This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account
    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
    For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,
    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
    Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
    Made me put this main secret in the packet
    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
    And no man see me more.
  NORFOLK.

SERVANT

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. Stay:

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. Who dares cross 'em,

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. Till I find more than will or words to do it-
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. The King, that gave it.
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. It must be himself then.
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. Yes, that goodness
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
  NORFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand;
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. So much fairer
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
RREY. This cannot save you.

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
  NORFOLK.

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
  SUFFOLK.

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. Then, that without the knowledge
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. Item, you sent a large commission
  SUFFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. That out of mere ambition you have caus'd
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. Then, that you have sent innumerable substance,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
AMBERLAIN. O my lord,
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. I forgive him.
  SUFFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-
  NORFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations
  NORFOLK. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations
    How to live better. For your stubborn answer
    About the giving back the great seal to us,
    The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.
                                                Exeunt all but WOLSEY
  WOLSEY.

SERVANT

OMWELL. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
  WOLSEY. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. That's somewhat sudden.
  CROMWELL. 
3
SERVANT

GUILDFORD

SERVANT

GUILDFORD

  CROMWELL. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE

SERVANT

CKINGHAM. All good people,
  LOVELL. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
VELL. I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
  LOVELL. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD

  VAUX.

SERVANT

  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!
                                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train

GUILDFORD

    What sudden anger's this? How have I reap'd it?
    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
    Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion
    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-
    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
    This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account
    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
    For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,
    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
    Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
    Made me put this main secret in the packet
    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
    And no man see me more.

0
CKINGHAM. An untimely ague
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. All the whole time
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Then you lost
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. O, you go far!
  NORFOLK.

0
RFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed

RFOLK. Surely, sir,
  ABERGAVENNY.

ERGAVENNY. Is it therefore

RFOLK. Marry, is't.

CKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal
  NORFOLK.

  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. He was brought to this

  KING. 
0
NG. How know'st thou this?
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. Not long before your Highness sped to France,

  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. On my soul, I'll speak but truth.

NG. Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. I can, my liege.
  KING. 
0
NG. Proceed.
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. Being at Greenwich,
  KING. 
0
NG. I remember
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. 'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-
  KING. 
0
NG. A giant traitor!
  WOLSEY. 
0
LSEY. Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN KATHARINE. God mend all!
  KING. 
0
NG. There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?
  SURVEYOR. 
0
RVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,'
  KING. 
0
NG. There's his period,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
0
AMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
  SANDYS. 
0
NDYS. New customs,
  CHAMBERLAIN.

AMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English
  SANDYS.

0
AMBERLAIN. I am glad 'tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs
  LOVELL. 
0
VELL. They must either,

  LOVELL. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
VELL. I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
  LOVELL.

  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
CKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,
    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
    Yet I am richer than my base accusers
    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;
    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,
    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd
    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins
    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all
    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
    For ever from the world. I had my trial,
    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
    A little happier than my wretched father;
    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
    A most unnatural and faithless service.
    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,
    This from a dying man receive as certain:
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
    Like water from ye, never found again
    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour
    Of my long weary life is come upon me.
    Farewell;
    And when you would say something that is sad,
    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

SERVANT

  SURREY.

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

  SUFFOLK. 
5
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING
FFOLK. The King, the King!
  KING. 
5
SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING
LSEY. My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,

5
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
KING

SERVANT
WOLSEY

SERVANT
WOLSEY

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
NG. 'Tis nobly spoken.
    Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
    For you have seen him open 't. Read o'er this;
                                                  [Giving him papers]
    And after, this; and then to breakfast with
    What appetite you have.
                Exit the KING, frowning upon the CARDINAL; the NOBLES
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. What should this mean?
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. What should this mean?
    What sudden anger's this? How have I reap'd it?
    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
    Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion
    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-
    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
    This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account
    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
    For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,
    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
    Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil
    Made me put this main secret in the packet
    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
    No new device to beat this from his brains?
    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'
    The letter, as I live, with all the business
    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
    And no man see me more.
  NORFOLK.

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
RFOLK. Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD

4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. Who dares cross 'em,

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. Till I find more than will or words to do it-
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. The King, that gave it.
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. It must be himself then.
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. Yes, that goodness
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
  NORFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand;
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
LSEY. So much fairer
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
RREY. This cannot save you.
  WOLSEY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD

WOLSEY

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD

  SUFFOLK.

SERVANT
WOLSEY

GUILDFORD
FFOLK. Then, that without the knowledge
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. Item, you sent a large commission
  SUFFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. That out of mere ambition you have caus'd
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. Then, that you have sent innumerable substance,
  CHAMBERLAIN. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
AMBERLAIN. O my lord,
  SURREY. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RREY. I forgive him.
  SUFFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
FFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-
  NORFOLK. 
4
SERVANT
WOLSEY
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations
  NORFOLK. 
3
SERVANT
ANNE
GUILDFORD
RFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations
    How to live better. For your stubborn answer
    About the giving back the great seal to us,
    The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.
                                                Exeunt all but WOLSEY
  WOLSEY.

  WOLSEY. 
3
SERVANT

GUILDFORD

SERVANT
