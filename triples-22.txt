He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I

How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
Mess

But few of any sort, and none of name.

A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full

Much deserv'd on his part, and equally rememb'red by Don

He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
Mess
0
I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much
Leon
0
Did he break out into tears?
Mess
0
In great measure.
Leon
0
A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than

I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no?
Mess

I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the

What is he that you ask for, niece?
Hero
0
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Mess
0
O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was.
Beat
0
He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng'd Cupid at
Leon

Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll

0
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
Beat
0
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a
Mess

And a good soldier too, lady.
Beat
0
And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?
Mess
0
A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff'd with all honourable
Beat
0
It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuff'd man; but for

You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry

Alas, he gets nothing by that! In our last conflict four of

Beat
0
Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion
Mess

I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
Beat
0
No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is

He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner

I will hold friends with you, lady.
Beat

Do, good friend.
Leon
0
You will never run mad, niece.
Beat

No, not till a hot January.
Mess

Don Pedro is approach'd.
Pedro
0
Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The
Leon
0
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace;
Pedro
0
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your
Leon
0
Her mother hath many times told me so.
Bene
0
Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask'd her?
Leon
0
Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
Pedro
0
You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you
Bene
0
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head
Beat
0
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick.
Bene
0
What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
Beat
0
Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet
Bene
0
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of
Beat
0
A dear happiness to women! They would else have been troubled
Bene
0
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman
Beat
0
Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as
Bene
0
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
Beat
0
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
Bene

I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a
Beat
0
You always end with a jade's trick. I know you of old.
Pedro
0
That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio and Signior
Leon
0
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [To Don
John
0
I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.
Leon
0
Please it your Grace lead on?
Pedro
0
Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.
Claud
0
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
Bene
0
I noted her not, but I look'd on her.
Claud
0
Is she not a modest young lady?
Bene
0
Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple
Claud
0
No. I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
Bene
0
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,
Claud
0
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how
Bene
0
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?
Claud
0
Can the world buy such a jewel?
Bene
0
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad
Claud
0
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I look'd on.
Bene
0
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.
Claud
0
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the

Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but

What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to

I charge thee on thy allegiance.
Bene

You hear, Count Claudio. I can be secret as a dumb man, I

0
If this were so, so were it utt'red.
Bene
0
Like the old tale, my lord: 'It is not so, nor 'twas not so;
Claud
0
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be
Pedro
0
Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
Claud
0
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
Pedro
0
By my troth, I speak my thought.
Claud
0
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
Bene
0
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
Claud
0
That I love her, I feel.
Pedro
0
That she is worthy, I know.
Bene
0
That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she
Pedro
0
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of
Claud

And never could maintain his part but in the force of his

That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me

0
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.

0
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with
Pedro
0
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt
Bene

If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and
Pedro
0
Well, as time shall try.
Bene
0
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear
Claud
0
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
Pedro
0
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou
Bene
0
I look for an earthquake too then.
Pedro
0
Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime,
Bene
0
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and
Claud
0
To the tuition of God. From my house--if I had it--
Pedro
0
The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.
Bene
0
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is
Claud
0
My liege, your Highness now may do me good.
Pedro
0
My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,
Claud
0
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
Pedro
0
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Claud
0
 my lord,
Pedro
0
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
Claud
0
How sweetly you do minister to love,
Pedro
0
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
Leon
0
How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he
Ant
0
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange
Leon
0
Are they good?
Ant
0
As the event stamps them; but they have a good cover, they
Leon
0
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
Ant
0
A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him
Leon
0
No, no. We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but
Con
0
What the goodyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure
John
0
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore
Con
0
You should hear reason.
John
0
And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?
Con
0
If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
John
0
I wonder that thou (being, as thou say'st thou art, born
Con
0
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may
John
0
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace,
Con
0
Can you make no use of your discontent?
John
0
I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Bora
0
I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is
John
0
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
Bora
0
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
John
0
Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
Bora
0
Even he.
John
0
A proper squire! And who? and who? which way looks he?
Bora
0
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
John
0
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
Bora
0
Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty
John
0
Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my
Con
0
To the death, my lord.
John
0
Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the greater that
Bora
0
We'll wait upon your lordship.
Leon
0
Was not Count John here at supper?
Ant
0
I saw him not.
Beat
0
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am
Hero
0
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
Beat
0
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
Leon
0
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth,
Beat
0
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in
Leon
0
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if
Ant
0
In faith, she's too curst.
Beat
0
Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God's sending
Leon
0
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
Beat
0
Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am
Leon
0
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
Beat
0
What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make
Leon
0
Well then, go you into hell?
Beat
0
No; but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an
Ant
0
[to Hero] Well, niece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
Beat
0
Yes faith. It is my cousin's duty to make cursy and say,
Leon
0
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
Beat
0
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would
Leon
0
Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit
Beat
0
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed
Leon
0
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
Beat
0
I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
Leon
0
The revellers are ent'ring, brother. Make good room.
Leon
0
The revellers are ent'ring, brother. Make good room.
                                                 [Exit Antonio.]
    Enter, [masked,] Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, and Balthasar.
Pedro
0
Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?
Hero
0
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
Pedro
0
With me in your company?
Hero
0
I may say so when I please.
Pedro
0
And when please you to say so?
Hero
0
When I like your favour, for God defend the lute should be
Pedro
0
My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
Hero
0
Why then, your visor should be thatch'd.
Pedro
0
Speak low if you speak love.         [Takes her aside.]
Balth
0
Well, I would you did like me.
Marg
0
So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill
Balth
0
Which is one?
Marg
0
I say my prayers aloud.
Balth
0
I love you the better. The hearers may cry Amen.
Marg
0
God match me with a good dancer!
Balth
0
Amen.
Marg
0
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done!
Balth
0
No more words. The clerk is answered.
Urs
0
I know you well enough. You are Signior Antonio.
Ant
0
At a word, I am not.
Urs
0
I know you by the waggling of your head.
Ant
0
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
Urs
0
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very
Ant
0
At a word, I am not.
Urs
0
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent
Beat
0
Will you not tell me who told you so?
Bene
0
No, you shall pardon me.
Beat
0
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
Bene
0
Not now.
Beat
0
That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the
Bene
0
What's he?
Beat
0
I am sure you know him well enough.
Bene
0
Not I, believe me.
Beat
0
Did he never make you laugh?
Bene
0
I pray you, what is he?
Beat
0
Why, he is the Prince's jester, a very dull fool. Only his
Bene
0
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
Beat
0
Do, do. He'll but break a comparison or two on me; which
Bene

In every good thing.
Beat
0
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next
John
0
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her
Bora
0
And that is Claudio. I know him by his bearing.
John
0
Are you not Signior Benedick?
Claud
0
You know me well. I am he.
John
0
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love. He is
Claud
0
How know you he loves her?
John
0
I heard him swear his affection.
Bora
0
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
John
0
Come, let us to the banquet.
Claud
0
Thus answer I in name of Benedick
Bene
0
Count Claudio?
Claud
0
Yea, the same.
Bene
0
Come, will you go with me?
Claud
0
Whither?
Bene
0
Even to the next willow, about your own business, County. What
Claud
0
I wish him joy of her.
Bene
0
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier. So they sell
Claud
0
I pray you leave me.
Bene
0
Ho! now you strike like the blind man! 'Twas the boy that
Claud
0
If it will not be, I'll leave you.                Exit.
Bene
0
Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges. But,
Pedro
0
Now, signior, where's the Count? Did you see him?
Bene
0
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame, I found
Pedro
0
To be whipt? What's his fault?
Bene
0
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed
Pedro
0
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is
Bene
0
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the
Pedro
0
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner.
Bene
0
If their singing answer your saying, by my faith you say
Pedro
0
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The gentleman that
Bene
0
O, she misus'd me past the endurance of a block! An oak but
Pedro
0
Look, here she comes.
Bene
0
Will your Grace command me any service to the world's end? I
Pedro
0
None, but to desire your good company.
Bene
0
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not! I cannot endure my Lady
Pedro
0
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior
Beat
0
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for
Pedro
0
You have put him down, lady; you have put him down.
Beat
0
So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove
Pedro
0
Why, how now, Count? Wherefore are you sad?
Claud
0
Not sad, my lord.
Pedro
0
How then? sick?
Claud
0
Neither, my lord.
Beat
0
The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but
Pedro
0
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though I'll
Leon
0
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes. His
Beat
0
Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.
Claud
0
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were but little
Beat
0
Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss
Pedro
0
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
Beat
0
Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy
Claud
0
And so she doth, cousin.
Beat
0
Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the world but
Pedro
0
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
Beat
0
I would rather have one of your father's getting. Hath your
Pedro
0
Will you have me, lady?
Beat
0
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days:
Pedro
0
Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes
Beat
0
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star
Leon
0
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
Beat
0
I cry you mercy, uncle, By your Grace's pardon.    Exit.
Pedro
0
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
Leon
0
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord. She
Pedro
0
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
Leon
0
O, by no means! She mocks all her wooers out of suit.
Pedro
0
She were an excellent wife for Benedick.
Leon
0
O Lord, my lord! if they were but a week married, they would
Pedro
0
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
Claud
0
To-morrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all
Leon
0
Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just

0
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing;
Leon
0
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights'
Claud
0
And I, my lord.
Pedro
0
And you too, gentle Hero?
Hero
0
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a
Pedro
0
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know.
John
0
It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of
Bora
0
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
John
0
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me.
Bora
0
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty
John
0
Show me briefly how.
Bora
0
I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in
John
0
I remember.
Bora
0
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her
John
0
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?
Bora
0
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the
John
0
What proof shall I make of that?
Bora
0
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo
John
0
Only to despite them I will endeavour anything.
Bora
0
Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
John
0
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in
Bora
0
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not

0
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

Signior?
Bene

In my chamber window lies a book. Bring it hither to me in
Boy
0
I am here already, sir.
Bene
0
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.
Pedro
0
Come, shall we hear this music?
Claud
0
Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
Pedro
0
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
Claud
0
O, very well, my lord. The music ended,
Pedro
0
Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
Balth
0
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
Pedro
0
It is the witness still of excellency
Balth
0
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,
Pedro
0
Nay, pray thee come;
Balth
0
Note this before my notes:
Pedro
0
Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks!
Bene
0
[aside] Now divine air! Now is his soul ravish'd! Is it not
Pedro
0
By my troth, a good song.
Balth
0
And an ill singer, my lord.
Pedro
0
Ha, no, no, faith! Thou sing'st well enough for a shift.
Bene
0
[aside] An he had been a dog that should have howl'd thus,
Pedro
0
Yea, marry. Dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee get us
Balth
0
The best I can, my lord.
Pedro
0
Do so. Farewell.
Claud
0
O, ay!-[Aside to Pedro] Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits.
Leon
0
No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote
Bene
0
[aside] Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
Leon
0
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but
Pedro
0
May be she doth but counterfeit.
Claud
0
Faith, like enough.
Leon
0
O God, counterfeit? There was never counterfeit of passion
Pedro
0
Why, what effects of passion shows she?
Claud
0
[aside] Bait the hook well! This fish will bite.
Leon
0
What effects, my lord? She will sit you--you heard my
Claud
0
She did indeed.
Pedro
0
How, how, I pray you? You amaze me. I would have thought her
Leon
0
I would have sworn it had, my lord--especially against
Bene
0
[aside] I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded
Claud
0
[aside] He hath ta'en th' infection. Hold it up.
Pedro
0
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
Leon
0
No, and swears she never will. That's her torment.
Claud
0
'Tis true indeed. So your daughter says. 'Shall I,' says
Leon
0
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for
Claud
0
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest
Leon
0
O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
Claud
0
That.
Leon
0
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, rail'd at
Claud
0
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her
Leon
0
She doth indeed; my daughter says so. And the ecstasy hath so
Pedro
0
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she
Claud
0
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the
Pedro
0
An he should, it were an alms to hang him! She's an
Claud
0
And she is exceeding wise.
Pedro
0
In everything but in loving Benedick.
Leon
0
O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,
Pedro
0
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have
Leon
0
Were it good, think you?
Claud
0
Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die
Pedro
0
She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, 'tis
Claud
0
He is a very proper man.
Pedro
0
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
Claud
0
Before God! and in my mind, very wise.
Pedro
0
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
Claud
0
And I take him to be valiant.
Pedro
0
As Hector, I assure you; and in the managing of quarrels you

0
If he do fear God, 'a must necessarily keep peace. If he

0
And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it

Never tell him, my lord. Let her wear it out with good

0
Nay, that's impossible; she may wear her heart out first.
Pedro
0
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it

My lord, will you .walk? Dinner is ready.
Claud
0
If he dote on her upon this, I will never trust my

Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your

0
This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they

0
Against my will I am sent to bid You come in to dinner.
Bene
0
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
Beat

I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to

You take pleasure then in the message?
Beat
0
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knives point, and
Bene
0
Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.'
Hero
0
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour.
Marg
0
I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.    [Exit.]
Hero
0
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
Urs
0
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Hero
0
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Urs
0
But are you sure
Hero
0
So says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.
Urs
0
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
Hero
0
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
Urs
0
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Hero
0
O god of love! I know he doth deserve
Urs
0
Sure I think so;
Hero
0
Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
Urs
0
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
Hero
0
No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,
Urs
0
Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
Hero
0
No; rather I will go to Benedick
Urs
0
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!
Hero
0
He is the only man of Italy,
Urs
0
I pray you be not angry with me, madam,
Hero
0
Indeed he hath an excellent good name.
Urs
0
His excellence did earn it ere he had it.
Hero
0
Why, every day to-morrow! Come, go in.
Urs
0
She's lim'd, I warrant you! We have caught her, madam.
Hero
0
If it prove so, then loving goes by haps;
Beat
0
What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
Pedro
0
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go
Claud
0
I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe me.
Pedro
0
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
Bene
0
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
Leon
0
So say I. Methinks you are sadder.
Claud
0
I hope he be in love.
Pedro
0
Hang him, truant! There's no true drop of blood in him to be
Bene
0
I have the toothache.
Pedro
0
Draw it.
Bene
0
Hang it!
Claud
0
You must hang it first and draw it afterwards.
Pedro
0
What? sigh for the toothache?
Leon
0
Where is but a humour or a worm.
Bene
0
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.
Claud
0
Yet say I he is in love.
Pedro
0
There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy
Claud
0
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing
Pedro
0
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
Claud
0
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him, and the
Leon
0
Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
Pedro
0
Nay, 'a rubs himself with civet. Can you smell him out by
Claud
0
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
Pedro
0
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
Claud
0
And when was he wont to wash his face?
Pedro
0
Yea, or to paint himself? for the which I hear what they say
Claud
0
Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is new-crept into a
Pedro
0
Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude,
Claud
0
Nay, but I know who loves him.
Pedro
0
That would I know too. I warrant, one that knows him not.
Claud
0
Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for
Pedro
0
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
Bene
0
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old signior, walk
Pedro
0
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!
Claud
0
'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their
John
0
My lord and brother, God save you.
Pedro
0
Good den, brother.
John
0
If your leisure serv'd, I would speak with you.
Pedro
0
In private?
John
0
If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I
Pedro
0
What's the matter?
John
0
[to Claudio] Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?
Pedro
0
You know he does.
John
0
I know not that, when he knows what I know.
Claud
0
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
John
0
You may think I love you not. Let that appear hereafter, and
Pedro
0
Why, what's the matter?
John
0
I came hither to tell you, and, circumstances short'ned (for
Claud
0
Who? Hero?
John
0
Even she--Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero.
Claud
0
Disloyal?
John
0
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness. I could say
Claud
0
May this be so?
Pedro
0
I will not think it.
John
0
If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you
Claud
0
If I see anything to-night why I should not marry her
Pedro
0
And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with
John
0
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses.
Pedro
0
O day untowardly turned!
Claud
0
O mischief strangely thwarting!
John
0
O plague right well prevented!
Dog
0
Are you good men and true?
Verg
0
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation,
Dog
0
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them if they should
Verg
0
Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
Dog
0
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Dog
0
Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath bless'd you with a
Dog
0
You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your
Dog
0
Why then, take no note of him, but let him go, and presently
Verg
0
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the
Dog
0
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince's
Dog
0
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I
Dog
0
Why then, let them alone till they are sober. If they make you
Dog
0
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
Dog
0
Truly, by your office you may; but I think they that touch
Verg
0
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
Dog
0
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who
Verg
0
If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the
Dog
0
Why then, depart in peace and let the child wake her with
Verg
0
'Tis very true.
Dog
0
This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present
Verg
0
Nay, by'r lady, that I think 'a cannot.
Dog
0
Five shillings to one on't with any man that knows the
Verg
0
By'r lady, I think it be so.
Dog
0
Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night. An there be any matter
Dog
0
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch about
Bora
0
What, Conrade!
Bora
0
Conrade, I say!
Con
0
Here, man. I am at thy elbow.
Bora
0
Mass, and my elbow itch'd! I thought there would a scab
Con
0
I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy
Bora
0
Stand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles
Bora
0
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
Con
0
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
Bora
0
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany
Con
0
I wonder at it.
Bora
0
That shows thou art unconfirm'd. Thou knowest that the
Con
0
Yes, it is apparel.
Bora
0
I mean the fashion.
Con
0
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
Bora
0
Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But seest thou
Bora
0
Didst thou not hear somebody?
Con
0
No; 'twas the vane on the house.
Bora
0
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?
Con
0
All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears out more
Bora
0
Not so neither. But know that I have to-night wooed Margaret,
Con
0
And thought they Margaret was Hero?
Bora
0
Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my
Con
0
Masters, masters--
Con
0
Masters--
Bora
0
We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of
Con
0
A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
Hero
0
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise.
Urs
0
I will, lady.
Hero
0
And bid her come hither.
Urs
0
Well.                                             [Exit.]
Marg
0
Troth, I think your other rebato were better.
Hero
0
No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
Marg
0
By my troth, 's not so good, and I warrant your cousin will
Hero
0
My cousin's a fool, and thou art another. I'll wear none but
Marg
0
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a
Hero
0
O, that exceeds, they say.
Marg
0
By my troth, 's but a nightgown in respect of yours--
Hero
0
God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exceeding heavy.
Marg
0
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
Hero
0
Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
Marg
0
Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not marriage
Hero
0
Good morrow, coz.
Beat
0
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
Hero
0
Why, how now? Do you speak in the sick tune?
Beat
0
I am out of all other tune, methinks.
Marg
0
Clap's into 'Light o' love.' That goes without a burden. Do
Beat
0
Yea, 'Light o' love' with your heels! then, if your husband
Marg
0
O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
Beat
0
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; 'tis time you were ready.
Marg
0
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
Beat
0
For the letter that begins them all, H.
Marg
0
Well, an you be not turn'd Turk, there's no more sailing by
Beat
0
What means the fool, trow?
Marg
0
Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
Hero
0
These gloves the Count sent me, they are an excellent
Beat
0
I am stuff'd, cousin; I cannot smell.
Marg
0
A maid, and stuff'd! There's goodly catching of cold.
Beat
0
O, God help me! God help me! How long have you profess'd
Marg
0
Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
Beat
0
It is not seen enough. You should wear it in your cap. By my
Marg
0
Get you some of this distill'd carduus benedictus and lay it
Hero
0
There thou prick'st her with a thistle.
Beat
0
Benedictus? why benedictus? You have some moral in this
Marg
0
Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant
Beat
0
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
Marg
0
Not a false gallop.
Urs
0
Madam, withdraw. The Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don
Hero
0
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
Leon
0
What would you with me, honest neighbour?
Dog
0
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns
Leon
0
Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
Dog
0
Marry, this it is, sir.
Verg
0
Yes, in truth it is, sir.
Leon
0
What is it, my good friends?
Dog
0
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter--an old
Verg
0
Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an
Dog
0
Comparisons are odorous. Palabras, neighbour Verges.
Leon
0
Neighbours, you are tedious.
Dog
0
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke's
Leon
0
All thy tediousness on me, ah?
Dog
0
Yea, in 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for I hear as
Verg
0
And so am I.
Leon
0
I would fain know what you have to say.
Verg
0
Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your worship's
Dog
0
A good old man, sir; he will be talking. As they say, 'When
Leon
0
Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
Dog
0
Gifts that God gives.
Leon
0
I must leave you.
Dog
0
One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
Leon

Take their examination yourself and bring it me. I am now in
Dog
0
It shall be suffigance.
Leon
0
Drink some wine ere you go. Fare you well.
Mess

My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her
Leon
0
I'll wait upon them. I am ready.
Dog
0
Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring
Verg
0
And we must do it wisely.
Dog
0
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you. Here's that shall
Leon
0
Come, Friar Francis, be brief. Only to the plain form of
Friar
0
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?
Claud
0
No.
Leon
0
To be married to her. Friar, you come to marry her.
Friar
0
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?
Hero
0
I do.
Friar
0
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should
Claud
0
Know you any, Hero?
Hero
0
None, my lord.
Friar
0
Know you any, Count?
Leon
0
I dare make his answer--none.
Claud
0
O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not
Bene
0
How now? interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as,
Claud
0
Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
Leon
0
As freely, son, as God did give her me.
Claud
0
And what have I to give you back whose worth
Pedro
0
Nothing, unless you render her again.
Claud
0
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
Leon
0
What do you mean, my lord?
Claud
0
Not to be married,
Leon
0
Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
Claud
0
I know what you would say. If I have known her,
Hero
0
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
Claud
0
Out on the seeming! I will write against it.
Hero
0
Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide?
Leon
0
Sweet Prince, why speak not you?
Pedro
0
What should I speak?
Leon
0
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
John
0
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
Bene
0
This looks not like a nuptial.
Hero
0
'True!' O God!
Claud
0
Leonato, stand I here?
Leon
0
All this is so; but what of this, my lord?
Claud
0
Let me but move one question to your daughter,
Leon
0
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
Hero
0
O, God defend me! How am I beset!
Claud
0
To make you answer truly to your name.
Hero
0
Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
Claud
0
Marry, that can Hero!
Hero
0
I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
Pedro
0
Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
John
0
Fie, fie! they are not to be nam'd, my lord--
Claud
0
O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been
Leon
0
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
Beat
0
Why, how now, cousin? Wherefore sink you down?
John
0
Come let us go. These things, come thus to light,
Bene
0
How doth the lady?
Beat
0
Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
Leon
0
O Fate, take not away thy heavy hand!
Beat
0
How now, cousin Hero?
Friar
0
Have comfort, lady.
Leon
0
Dost thou look up?
Friar
0
Yea, wherefore should she not?
Leon
0
Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing
Bene
0
Sir, sir, be patient.
Beat
0
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
Bene
0
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
Beat
0
No, truly, not; although, until last night,
Leon
0
Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
Friar
0
Hear me a little;
Leon
0
Friar, it cannot be.
Friar
0
Lady, what man is he you are accus'd of?
Hero
0
They know that do accuse me; I know none.
Friar
0
There is some strange misprision in the princes.
Bene
0
Two of them have the very bent of honour;
Leon
0
I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
Friar
0
Pause awhile
Leon
0
What shall become of this? What will this do?
Friar
0
Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Bene
0
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you;
Leon
0
Being that I flow in grief,
Friar
0
'Tis well consented. Presently away;
Bene
0
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
Beat
0
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
Bene
0
I will not desire that.
Beat
0
You have no reason. I do it freely.
Bene
0
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
Beat
0
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right
Bene
0
Is there any way to show such friendship?
Beat
0
A very even way, but no such friend.
Bene
0
May a man do it?
Beat
0
It is a man's office, but not yours.
Bene
0
I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Is not that
Beat
0
As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for
Bene
0
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
Beat
0
Do not swear, and eat it.
Bene
0
I will swear by it that you love me, and I will make him eat
Beat
0
Will you not eat your word?
Bene
0
With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love
Beat
0
Why then, God forgive me!
Bene
0
What offence, sweet Beatrice?
Beat
0
You have stayed me in a happy hour. I was about to protest I
Bene
0
And do it with all thy heart.
Beat
0
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to
Bene
0
Come, bid me do anything for thee.
Beat
0
Kill Claudio.
Bene
0
Ha! not for the wide world!
Beat
0
You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
Bene
0
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
Beat
0
I am gone, though I am here. There is no love in you. Nay, I
Bene
0
Beatrice--
Beat
0
In faith, I will go.
Bene
0
We'll be friends first.
Beat
0
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine
Bene
0
Is Claudio thine enemy?
Beat
0
Is 'a not approved in the height a villain, that hath
Bene
0
Hear me, Beatrice!
Beat
0
Talk with a man out at a window!-a proper saying!
Bene
0
Nay but Beatrice--
Beat
0
Sweet Hero! she is wrong'd, she is sland'red, she is undone.
Bene
0
Beat--
Beat
0
Princes and Counties! Surely a princely testimony, a goodly
Bene
0
Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
Beat
0
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
Bene
0
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wrong'd Hero?
Beat
0
Yea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul.
Bene
0
Enough, I am engag'd, I will challenge him. I will kiss your
Dog
0
Is our whole dissembly appear'd?
Verg
0
O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
Sex
0
Which be the malefactors?
Dog
0
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Verg
0
Nay, that's certain. We have the exhibition to examine.
Sex
0
But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them
Dog
0
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name,
Bor
0
Borachio.
Dog
0
Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
Con
0
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
Dog
0
Write down Master Gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve
Both
0
Yea, sir, we hope.
Dog
0
Write down that they hope they serve God; and write God first,
Con
0
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
Dog
0
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go about
Bora
0
Sir, I say to you we are none.
Dog
0
Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale.
Sex
0
Master Constable, you go not the way to examine. You must call
Dog
0
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.
Dog
0
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury,
Bora
0
Master Constable--
Dog
0
Pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy look, I promise
Sex
0
What heard you him say else?
Dog
0
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
Verg
0
Yea, by th' mass, that it is.
Sex
0
What else, fellow?
Dog
0
O villain! thou wilt be condemn'd into everlasting redemption
Sex
0
What else?
Watchmen

This is all.

And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is

Come, let them be opinion'd.

Let them be in the hands--

0
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,
Leon
0
I pray thee cease thy counsel,
Ant
0
Therein do men from children nothing differ.
Leon
0
I pray thee peace. I will be flesh and blood;
Ant
0
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.
Leon
0
There thou speak'st reason. Nay, I will do so.
Ant
0
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
Pedro
0
Good den, Good den.
Claud
0
Good day to both of you.
Leon
0
Hear you, my lords!
Pedro
0
We have some haste, Leonato.
Leon
0
Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord.
Pedro
0
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
Ant
0
If he could right himself with quarrelling,
Claud
0
Who wrongs him?
Leon
0
Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou!
Claud
0
Mary, beshrew my hand
Leon
0
Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me
Claud
0
My villany?
Leon
0
Thine, Claudio; thine I say.
Pedro
0
You say not right, old man
Leon
0
My lord, my lord,
Claud
0
Away! I will not have to do with you.
Leon
0
Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child.
Leon
0
Brother--
Ant
0
Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece,
Leon
0
Brother Anthony--
Ant
0
Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
Leon
0
But, brother Anthony--
Ant
0
Come, 'tis no matter.
Pedro
0
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
Leon
0
My lord, my lord--
Pedro
0
I will not hear you.
Leon
0
No? Come, brother, away!--I will be heard.
Ant
0
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
Pedro
0
See, see! Here comes the man we went to seek.
Claud
0
Now, signior, what news?
Bene
0
Good day, my lord.
Pedro
0
Welcome, signior. You are almost come to part almost a fray.
Claud
0
We had lik'd to have had our two noses snapp'd off with two
Pedro
0
Leonato and his brother. What think'st thou? Had we fought,
Bene
0
In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek
Claud
0
We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof
Bene
0
It is in my scabbard. Shall I draw it?

Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
Claud

Never any did so, though very many have been beside their

As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick or

What, courage, man! What though care kill'd a cat, thou hast

0
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it
Claud
0
Nay then, give him another staff; this last was broke cross.
Pedro
0
By this light, he changes more and more. I think he be angry
Claud
0
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
Bene
0
Shall I speak a word in your ear?
Claud
0
God bless me from a challenge!
Bene
0
[aside to Claudio] You are a villain. I jest not; I will make
Claud
0
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
Pedro
0
What, a feast, a feast?
Claud
0
I' faith, I thank him, he hath bid me to a calve's head and
Bene
0
Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
Pedro
0
I'll tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day. I

For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.
Pedro
0
Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not

All, all! and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the

But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the

Fare you well, boy; you know my mind. I will leave you now to

He is in earnest.
Claud
0
In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the

And hath challeng'd thee.
Claud
0
Most sincerely.
Pedro

What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and

He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to

But, soft you, let me be! Pluck up, my heart, and be sad!

Come you, sir. If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er

0
How now? two of my brother's men bound? Borachio one.
Claud
0
Hearken after their offence, my lord.
Pedro
0
Officers, what offence have these men done?
Dog
0
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
Pedro
0
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee
Claud
0
Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and by my troth
Pedro

Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to

Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you
Pedro
0
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
Claud
0
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
Pedro
0
But did my brother set thee on to this?
Bora
0
Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.
Pedro
0
He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery,
Claud
0
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear
Dog
0
Come, bring away the plaintiffs. By this time our sexton hath

Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too.
Leon
0
Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,
Bora
0
If you would know your wronger, look on me.
Leon
0
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
Bora
0
Yea, even I alone.
Leon
0
No, not so, villain! thou beliest thyself.
Claud
0
I know not how to pray your patience;
Pedro
0
By my soul, nor I!
Leon
0
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live-
Claud
0
O noble sir!
Leon
0
To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
Bora
0
No, by my soul, she was not;
Dog

Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black, this
Leon

I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
Dog

Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth,

There's for thy pains. [Gives money.]
Dog
0
God save the foundation!
Leon
0
Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
Dog
0
I leave an arrant knave with your worship, which I beseech
Leon
0
Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
Ant
0
Farewell, my lords. We look for you to-morrow.
Pedro
0
We will not fall.
Claud

To-night I'll mourn with Hero.

Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands
Marg
0
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
Bene
0
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come
Marg
0
To have no man come over me? Why, shall I always keep below
Bene
0
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth--it catches.
Marg
0
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit but hurt
Bene
0
A most manly wit, Margaret: it will not hurt a woman.
Marg
0
Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
Bene
0
If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a
Marg
0
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
Bene
0
And therefore will come.
Beat
0
Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
Bene
0
O, stay but till then!
Beat
0
'Then' is spoken. Fare you well now. And yet, ere I go, let
Bene
0
Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
Beat

Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul

Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so

For them all together, which maintain'd so politic a state of

In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you
Bene
0
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
Beat
0
It appears not in this confession. There's not one wise man
Bene
0
An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that liv'd in the time of
Beat
0
And how long is that, think you?
Bene
0
Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum.
Beat
0
Very ill.
Bene
0
And how do you?
Beat
0
Very ill too.
Bene
0
Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for
Urs
0
Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home.
Beat

Will you go hear this news, signior?
Bene
0
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried thy

Is this the monument of Leonato?
Lord
0
It is, my lord.
Claud

Claud
0
Now unto thy bones good night!
Pedro
0
Good morrow, masters. Put your torches out.
Claud
0
Good morrow, masters. Each his several way.
Pedro
0
Come, let us hence and put on other weeds,
Claud
0
And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds
Friar
0
Did I not tell you she was innocent?
Leon

So are the Prince and Claudio, who accus'd her
Ant
0
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
Bene
0
And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd
Leon
0
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
Ant
0
Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
Bene
0
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
Friar
0
To do what, signior?
Bene
0
To bind me, or undo me--one of them.
Leon
0
That eye my daughter lent her. 'Tis most true.
Bene
0
And I do with an eye of love requite her.
Leon
0
The sight whereof I think you had from me,
Bene
0
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical;
Leon
0
My heart is with your liking.
Friar
0
And my help.
Pedro
0
Good morrow to this fair assembly.
Leon
0
Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.
Claud
0
I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
Leon
0
Call her forth, brother. Here's the friar ready.
Pedro
0
Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter
Claud
0
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
Bene
0
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,
Claud
0
For this I owe you. Here comes other reckonings.
Ant
0
This same is she, and I do give you her.
Claud
0
Why then, she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
Leon
0
No, that you shall not till you take her hand
Claud
0
Give me your hand before this holy friar.
Hero
0
And when I liv'd I was your other wife;       [Unmasks.]
Claud
0
Another Hero!
Hero
0
Nothing certainer.
Pedro
0
The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
Leon
0
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd.
Friar
0
All this amazement can I qualify,
Bene
0
Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
Beat
0
[unmasks] I answer to that name. What is your will?
Bene
0
Do not you love me?
Beat
0
Why, no; no more than reason.
Bene
0
Why, then your uncle, and the Prince, and Claudio
Beat
0
Do not you love me?
Bene
0
Troth, no; no more than reason.
Beat
0
Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula
Bene
0
They swore that you were almost sick for me.
Beat
0
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
Bene
0
'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
Beat
0
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
Leon
0
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
Claud
0
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
Hero
0
And here's another,
Bene
0
A miracle! Here's our own hands against our hearts.
Beat
0
I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon
Bene
0
Peace! I will stop your mouth.             [Kisses her.]
Beat

I'll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot

I had well hop'd thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I

Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are

We'll have dancing afterward.

First, of my word! Therefore play, music. Prince, thou art

Think not on him till to-morrow. I'll devise thee brave
