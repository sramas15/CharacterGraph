Hero
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this
night to Messina.

Mess
2
Hero
Leon
He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I
left him.

Leon
2
Mess
Hero
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?

Mess
2
Hero
Leon
But few of any sort, and none of name.

Leon
2
Mess
Hero
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on
a young Florentine called Claudio.

Mess
2
Hero
Leon
Much deserv'd on his part, and equally rememb'red by Don
Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing
in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed
better bett'red expectation than you must expect of me to tell
you how.

Leon
2
Mess
Hero
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.

Mess
2
Hero
Leon
I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much
joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness.

Leon
2
Mess
Hero
Did he break out into tears?

Mess
2
Hero
Leon
In great measure.

Leon
2
Mess
Hero
A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than
those that are so wash'd. How much better is it to weep at joy
than to joy at weeping!

I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no?

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the
army of any sort.

Leon

Mess
Beat
Hero
What is he that you ask for, niece?

Hero

Mess
Beat
Leon
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng'd Cupid at
the flight, and my uncle's fool, reading the challenge,
subscrib'd for Cupid and challeng'd him at the burbolt. I pray
you, how many hath he kill'd and eaten in these wars? But how
many hath he kill'd? For indeed I promised to eat all of his
killing.

Leon
3
Mess
Beat
Hero
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll
be meet with you, I doubt it not.

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a
very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach.

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
And a good soldier too, lady.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff'd with all honourable
virtues.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuff'd man; but for
the stuffing--well, we are all mortal.

Leon
3
Mess
Beat
Hero
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry
war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never meet but there's
a skirmish of wit between them.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
Alas, he gets nothing by that! In our last conflict four of
his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern'd
with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let
him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for
it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new
sworn brother.

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
Is't possible?

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion
of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is
his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil?

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner
caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God
help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will
cost him a thousand pound ere 'a be cured.

Mess
3
Beat
Hero
Leon
I will hold friends with you, lady.

Beat
3
Mess
Hero
Leon
Do, good friend.

Leon

Mess
Beat
Hero
You will never run mad, niece.

No, not till a hot January.

Don Pedro is approach'd.

Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The
fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.

Leon

Pedro
Hero
Mess

Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace;
for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart
from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.

You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your

Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask'd her?

Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.

Pedro

Leon

You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you
are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady;
for you are like an honourable father.

Bene

If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head
on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.

I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick.
Nobody marks you.

What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?

Beat
6
Pedro
Hero
Mess

Bene

Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet
food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert
to disdain if you come in her presence.

Bene

Pedro
Hero
Mess
Leon
Beat

Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of
all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my
heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.

Beat

Pedro
Hero
Mess
Leon
Bene
John
A dear happiness to women! They would else have been troubled
with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of
your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.

God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman
or other shall scape a predestinate scratch'd face.

That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio and Signior
Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him
we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays
some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.

Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,
too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise.

is, I do not like her.

All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying I lik'd her ere I went to wars.

I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale.
Then after to her father will I break,
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practice let us put it presently.                 Exeunt.

news that you yet dreamt not of.

Are they good?

Ant
1

As the event stamps them; but they have a good cover, they
show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a
thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by
a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a
dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the
present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.

yourself.

If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.

John

I wonder that thou (being, as thou say'st thou art, born
under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when
I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have
stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am drowsy,
and tend on no man's business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no
man in his humour.

Con
1
John
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against
your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where
it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest.

John

Con
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace,
and it better fits my blood to be disdain'd of all than to
fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot
be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but
I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and
enfranchis'd with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in
my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I
would do my liking. In the meantime let me be that I am, and seek
not to alter me.

Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty

upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
obtain'd her, give her to Count Claudio.

Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am

youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that
is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a
man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in

No; but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an

Beatrice, get you to heaven. Here's no place for you maids.' So
deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter--for the heavens.

No, uncle, I'll none. Adam's sons are my brethren, and truly I

Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit
you in that kind, you know your answer.

The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed
in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is
measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me,
Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a
measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty like
a Scotch jig--and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly
modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace
faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.

Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.

I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such
impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark,
with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every
word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to the North
Star. I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that
Adam had left him before he transgress'd. She would have made
Hercules have turn'd spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make

And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know.
Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved
valour, and confirm'd honesty. I will teach you how to humour
your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I,
[to Leonato and Claudio] with your two helps, will so practise on
Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are
the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

John

It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of
Leonato.

Bora
1
John
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.

John
1
Bora
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me.
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his
affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this
marriage?

Bora
1
John
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me.

John
1
Bora
Show me briefly how.

Bora
1
John
I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in
the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

John
1
Bora
I remember.

Bora
1
John
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her
to look out at her lady's chamber window.

John
1
Bora
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?

Bora
1
John
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the
Prince your brother; spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio (whose estimation do
you mightily hold up) to a contaminated stale, such a one as
Hero.

John
1
Bora
What proof shall I make of that?

Bora
1
John
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo
Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?

John
1
Bora
Only to despite them I will endeavour anything.

Bora
1
John
Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
Claudio alone; tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend
a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as--in love of
your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
reputation, who is thus like to be cozen'd with the semblance of
a maid--that you have discover'd thus. They will scarcely believe
this without trial. Offer them instances; which shall bear no
less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me
call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them
to see this the very night before the intended wedding (for in
the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent) and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's
disloyalty that jealousy shall be call'd assurance and all the
preparation overthrown.

John
1
Bora
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in
practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a
thousand ducats.

Bora
1
John
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not
shame me.

John
1
Bora
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!

Nay, pray thee come;
Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,

Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

No, and swears she never will. That's her torment.

'Tis true indeed. So your daughter says. 'Shall I,' says
she, 'that have so oft encount'red him with scorn, write to him
that I love him?'"

Leon

Boy
Pedro
Balth
Bene
Claud
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for
she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her
smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us
all.

Claud

Boy

Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest
your daughter told us of.

Leon

Boy

O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
'Benedick' and 'Beatrice' between the sheet?

Claud

That.

Leon
5
Boy
Pedro
Balth
Bene
Claud
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, rail'd at
herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
knew would flout her. 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own
spirit; for I should flout him if he writ to me. Yea, though I
love him, I should.'

Claud
5
Boy
Pedro
Leon

Bene
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her
heart, tears her hair, prays, curses--'O sweet Benedick! God give
me patience!'

Leon
5
Boy
Pedro
Balth
Bene
Claud
She doth indeed; my daughter says so. And the ecstasy hath so
much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will
do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.

Pedro

Boy
Leon
Balth

Claud
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she
will not discover it.

Claud
5
Boy
Pedro

Bene
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the
poor lady worse.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon

An he should, it were an alms to hang him! She's an
excellent sweet lady, and (out of all suspicion) she is virtuous.

Claud

And she is exceeding wise.

In everything but in loving Benedick.

Leon

Pedro

O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,
we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry
for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon
Balth
Bene

I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have
daff'd all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you
tell Benedick of it and hear what 'a will say.

Leon
5
Boy
Pedro
Balth
Bene
Claud
Were it good, think you?

Claud
5
Boy
Pedro
Leon
Balth
Bene
Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die
if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known,
and she will die, if he woo her, rather than she will bate one
breath of her accustomed crossness.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon
Balth
Bene
Claud
She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, 'tis
very possible he'll scorn it; for the man (as you know all) hath
a contemptible spirit.

Claud

Boy
Pedro

He is a very proper man.

Pedro

Before God! and in my mind, very wise.

And I take him to be valiant.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon

As Hector, I assure you; and in the managing of quarrels you
may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great
discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear.

Leon
5
Boy
Pedro

If he do fear God, 'a must necessarily keep peace. If he
break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
trembling.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon
Balth
Bene
Claud
And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it
seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am
sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of
her love?

Claud
5
Boy
Pedro
Leon
Balth

Never tell him, my lord. Let her wear it out with good
counsel.

Leon
5
Boy

Claud
Nay, that's impossible; she may wear her heart out first.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon
Balth
Bene

Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it
cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would
modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a
lady.

Leon

Boy

Bene
Claud
My lord, will you .walk? Dinner is ready.

Claud
5
Boy
Pedro

If he dote on her upon this, I will never trust my
expectation.

Pedro
5
Boy
Leon
Balth
Bene
Claud
Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your
daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be, when they
hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter.
That's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb
show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

Bene
5
Boy
Pedro
Leon
Balth
Claud
This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they
have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady.
It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it
must be requited. I hear how I am censur'd. They say I will bear
myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say too
that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that
hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the
lady is fair--'tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous
--'tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me--by
my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of
her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance
have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I
have railed so long against marriage. But doth not the appetite
alters? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure
in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No, the world
must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not
think I should live till I were married.
Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she's a fair lady! I do spy
some marks of love in her.

Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour.
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursley
Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
Is all of her. Say that thou overheard'st us;
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,
Forbid the sun to enter--like favourites,
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her
To listen our propose. This is thy office.
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
As we do trace this alley up and down,
Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit.
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
That only wounds by hearsay.
Now begin;
For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.

The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish

Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing

O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But Nature never fram'd a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprizing what they look on; and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endeared.

Urs

Sure I think so;
And therefore certainly it were not good

Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur'd,
But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac'd,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit!
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.

Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear
it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth.
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring, and the little
hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a
bell; and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks,
his tongue speaks.

There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy

Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
A thousand times in secret.

Strike at thy life. Griev'd I, I had but one?
Child I for that at frugal nature's frame?
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
Why had I not with charitable hand
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
Who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy,
I might have said, 'No part of it is mine;
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd,
And mine that I was proud on--mine so much
That I myself was to myself not mine,
Valuing of her--why, she, O, she is fall'n

Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,
And salt too little which may season give

Hear me a little;
For I have only been silent so long,
And given way unto this course of fortune,
By noting of the lady. I have mark'd
A thousand blushing apparitions
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
Trust not my reading nor my observation,
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
The tenure of my book; trust not my age,
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Under some biting error.

Ability in means, and choice of friends,

Your daughter here the princes left for dead,
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
And publish it that she is dead indeed;
Maintain a mourning ostentation,
And on your family's old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial.

Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse. That is some good.
But not for that dream I on this strange course,
But on this travail look for greater birth.
She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
Upon the instant that she was accus'd,
Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus'd
Of every hearer; for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio.
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
Th' idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
More moving, delicate, and full of life,
Into the eye and prospect of his soul
Than when she liv'd indeed. Then shall he mourn
(If ever love had interest in his liver)
And wish he had not so accused her--
No, though be thought his accusation true.
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
The supposition of the lady's death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy.
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
As best befits her wounded reputation,
In some reclusive and religious life,
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.

I pray thee cease thy counsel,
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so lov'd his child,
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
And bid him speak to me of patience.
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,
And let it answer every strain for strain,
As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan,
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
With candle-wasters--bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man; for, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion, which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air and agony with words.
No, no! 'Tis all men's office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
As under privilege of age to brag
What I have done being young, or what would do,
Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
And she lied buried with her ancestors-
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
Save this of hers, fram'd by thy villany!

Win me and wear me! Let him answer me.
Come, follow me, boy,. Come, sir boy, come follow me.

Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece,

Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,
Scambling, outfacing, fashion-monging boys,
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
And speak off half a dozen dang'rous words,
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
And this is all.

Welcome, signior. You are almost come to part almost a fray.

We had lik'd to have had our two noses snapp'd off with two

Leonato and his brother. What think'st thou? Had we fought,
I doubt we should have been too young for them.

In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek
you both.

Claud

Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?

Never any did so, though very many have been beside their
wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrel--draw to
pleasure us.

mettle enough in thee to kill care.

sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear

Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.

Pedro
4
Ant
Bene
Claud

I'll tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day. I
said thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,' said she, 'a fine little
one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.' 'Right,' says she, 'a great
gross one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit.' 'Just,' said she, 'it
hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise.' 'Certain,'
said she, a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the
tongues.' 'That I believe' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me
on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning. There's a
double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus did she an hour
together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at last she
concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper'st man in Italy.

Claud
4
Ant
Bene
Pedro
Leon
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.

Pedro
4
Ant
Bene
Claud
Leon
Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not
hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's
daughter told us all.

Claud
4
Ant
Bene
Pedro
Leon
All, all! and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the
garden.

Pedro
4
Ant
Bene
Claud
Leon
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the
sensible Benedick's head?

Claud
4
Ant
Bene
Pedro
Leon
Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick, the married
man'?

Bene
4
Ant
Pedro
Claud
Leon
Fare you well, boy; you know my mind. I will leave you now to
your gossiplike humour. You break jests as braggards do their
blades, which God be thanked hurt not. My lord, for your many
courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your
brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you
kill'd a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he
and I shall meet; and till then peace be with him.

Pedro
4
Ant
Bene
Claud

He is in earnest.

Claud

Ant
Bene
Pedro

In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the
love of Beatrice.

Pedro

unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves.

Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you
hear me, and let this Count kill me. I have deceived even your
very eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow
fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me
confessing to this man, how Don John your brother incensed me to
slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and
saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments; how you disgrac'd her
when you should marry her. My villany they have upon record,
which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false
accusation; and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a
villain.

Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,
And sing it to her bones--sing it to-night.

Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,

And so I pray thee call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.

Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.

And therefore will come.
I mean in singing; but in loving Leander the good swimmer,
Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole book full of
these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the
even road of a blank verse--why, they were never so truly turn'd
over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in
rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby'
--an innocent rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn'--a hard rhyme; for
'school', 'fool'--a babbling rhyme: very ominous endings! No, I
was not born under a rhyming planet, nor cannot woo in festival
terms.
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I call'd thee?

Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so
forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio

or I will subscribe him a coward. And I pray thee now tell me,
for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?

Beat

For them all together, which maintain'd so politic a state of
evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with
them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love
for me?

Suffer love!--a good epithet. I do suffer love indeed, for I
love thee against my will.

In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you
spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I will never
love that which my friend hates.

Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

It appears not in this confession. There's not one wise man

An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that liv'd in the time of

rings and the widow weeps.

Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum.
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm (his
conscience) find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet
of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising
myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now
tell me, how doth your cousin?

Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.
We here attend you. Are you yet determin'd
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?

Claud

I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.

Call her forth, brother. Here's the friar ready.

Pedro

Friar

Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter
That you have such a February face,
So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?

Claud

Pedro

Bene
Friar
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
Tush, fear not, man! We'll tip thy horns with gold,
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
As once Europa did at lusty Jove
When he would play the noble beast in love.

Friar
Claud
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow
And got a calf in that same noble feat
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

Claud

For this I owe you. Here comes other reckonings.
Which is the lady I must seize upon?

This same is she, and I do give you her.

Why then, she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.

Leon

No, that you shall not till you take her hand
Before this friar and swear to marry her.

Claud

Give me your hand before this holy friar.
I am your husband if you like of me.

Hero

And when I liv'd I was your other wife;       [Unmasks.]
And when you lov'd you were my other husband.

Claud

Pedro

Friar
Another Hero!

Hero

Pedro
Leon
Ant
Bene
Friar
Claud
Nothing certainer.
One Hero died defil'd; but I do live,
And surely as I live, I am a maid.

Pedro

The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd.

All this amazement can I qualify,
When, after that the holy rites are ended,
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death.
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
And to the chapel let us presently.

Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?

[unmasks] I answer to that name. What is your will?

Beat

Do not you love me?

Beat

Pedro

Why, no; no more than reason.

Bene

Pedro

Beat
Leon
Ant
Friar

Why, then your uncle, and the Prince, and Claudio
Have been deceived; for they swore you did.

Beat

Do not you love me?

Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula
Are much deceiv'd; for they did swear you did.

Bene

They swore that you were almost sick for me.

Beat

They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

Bene

Pedro

'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?

Beat

No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

Claud

Pedro
Hero
Beat
Leon
Ant
Bene
Friar
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
For here's a paper written in his hand,
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
Fashion'd to Beatrice.

Hero

Pedro
Beat
Leon
Ant
Bene
Friar
Claud
And here's another,
Writ in my cousin's hand, stol'n from her pocket,
Containing her affection unto Benedick.

Bene

A miracle! Here's our own hands against our hearts.
Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity.

Beat

Pedro
Hero
Leon
Ant
Bene
Friar
Claud
I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon
great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told
you were in a consumption.

Bene

Peace! I will stop your mouth.             [Kisses her.]

I'll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot
flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or
an epigram? No. If a man will be beaten with brains, 'a shall
wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to
marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say
against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion.
For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but in
that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis'd, and love my
cousin.

Claud

Beat

Ant
Bene
Friar
I had well hop'd thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I
might have cudgell'd thee out of thy single life, to make thee a
double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do
not look exceeding narrowly to thee.

Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are
married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels.

We'll have dancing afterward.

First, of my word! Therefore play, music. Prince, thou art
sad. Get thee a wife, get thee a wife! There is no staff more
reverent than one tipp'd with horn.
