As by your high imperial Majesty
KING HENRY
0
Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
QUEEN
0
Great King of England, and my gracious lord,
KING HENRY
0
Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
ALL
0
[Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!
QUEEN
0
We thank you all.                            [Flourish]
SUFFOLK

My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,
GLOUCESTER

[Reads] 'Imprimis: It is agreed between the French King
KING HENRY

Uncle, how now!
GLOUCESTER
0
Pardon me, gracious lord;
KING HENRY
0
Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.
CARDINAL

[Reads] 'Item: It is further agreed between them that the
KING HENRY

They please us well. Lord Marquess, kneel down.
GLOUCESTER
0
Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
CARDINAL
0
Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can;
SALISBURY
0
Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
WARWICK
0
For grief that they are past recovery;
YORK
0
For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
GLOUCESTER
0
A proper jest, and never heard before,
CARDINAL
0
My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:
GLOUCESTER
0
My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
CARDINAL
0
So, there goes our Protector in a rage.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Why should he then protect our sovereign,
CARDINAL
0
This weighty business will not brook delay;
SOMERSET
0
Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
BUCKINGHAM
0
Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,
SALISBURY
0
Pride went before, ambition follows him.
WARWICK
0
So God help Warwick, as he loves the land
YORK
0
And so says York- [Aside] for he hath greatest cause.
SALISBURY
0
Then let's make haste away and look unto the main.
WARWICK
0
Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost-
YORK
0
Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
DUCHESS
0
Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn
GLOUCESTER
0
O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
DUCHESS
0
What dream'd my lord? Tell me, and I'll requite it
GLOUCESTER
0
Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
DUCHESS
0
Tut, this was nothing but an argument
GLOUCESTER
0
Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright.
DUCHESS
0
What, what, my lord! Are you so choleric
GLOUCESTER
0
Nay, be not angry; I am pleas'd again.
MESSENGER
0
My Lord Protector, 'tis his Highness' pleasure
GLOUCESTER
0
I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
DUCHESS
0
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
HUME
0
Jesus preserve your royal Majesty!
DUCHESS
0
What say'st thou? Majesty! I am but Grace.
HUME
0
But, by the grace of God and Hume's advice,
DUCHESS
0
What say'st thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferr'd
HUME
0
This they have promised, to show your Highness
DUCHESS
0
It is enough; I'll think upon the questions;
HUME
0
Hume must make merry with the Duchess' gold;
FIRST PETITIONER
0
My masters, let's stand close; my Lord Protector
SECOND PETITIONER
0
Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good
FIRST PETITIONER
0
Here 'a comes, methinks, and the Queen with him.
SECOND PETITIONER
0
Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk and
SUFFOLK
0
How now, fellow! Wouldst anything with me?
FIRST PETITIONER
0
I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my Lord
QUEEN
0
[Reads] 'To my Lord Protector!' Are your supplications to
FIRST PETITIONER
0
Mine is, an't please your Grace, against John
SUFFOLK
0
Thy wife too! That's some wrong indeed. What's yours?
SECOND PETITIONER
0
Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our
PETER
0
[Presenting his petition] Against my master, Thomas Horner,
QUEEN
0
What say'st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful
PETER
0
That my master was? No, forsooth. My master said that he
SUFFOLK
0
Who is there? [Enter servant] Take this fellow in, and
QUEEN
0
And as for you, that love to be protected
ALL
0
Come, let's be gone.                               Exeunt
QUEEN
0
My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
SUFFOLK
0
Madam, be patient. As I was cause
QUEEN
0
Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort
SUFFOLK
0
And he of these that can do most of all
QUEEN
0
Not all these lords do vex me half so much
SUFFOLK
0
Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
KING HENRY
0
For my part, noble lords, I care not which:
YORK
0
If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
SOMERSET
0
If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
WARWICK
0
Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,
CARDINAL
0
Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
WARWICK
0
The Cardinal's not my better in the field.
BUCKINGHAM
0
All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
WARWICK
0
Warwick may live to be the best of all.
SALISBURY
0
Peace, son! And show some reason, Buckingham,
QUEEN
0
Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.
GLOUCESTER
0
Madam, the King is old enough himself
QUEEN
0
If he be old enough, what needs your Grace
GLOUCESTER
0
Madam, I am Protector of the realm;
SUFFOLK
0
Resign it then, and leave thine insolence.
CARDINAL
0
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
SOMERSET
0
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
BUCKINGHAM
0
Thy cruelty in execution
QUEEN
0
Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
DUCHESS
0
Was't I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.
KING HENRY
0
Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
DUCHESS
0
Against her will, good King? Look to 't in time;
BUCKINGHAM
0
Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
    And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds.
    She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
    She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.            Exit
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Now, lords, my choler being overblown
SUFFOLK
1
GLOUCESTER
Before we make election, give me leave
YORK
1
GLOUCESTER
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
WARWICK
1
GLOUCESTER
That can I witness; and a fouler fact
SUFFOLK
1
GLOUCESTER
Peace, headstrong Warwick!
WARWICK
1
GLOUCESTER
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
SUFFOLK
1
GLOUCESTER
Because here is a man accus'd of treason:
YORK
1
GLOUCESTER
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
KING HENRY
1
GLOUCESTER
What mean'st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?
SUFFOLK
1
GLOUCESTER
Please it your Majesty, this is the man
KING HENRY
1
GLOUCESTER
Say, man, were these thy words?
HORNER

GLOUCESTER
An't shall please your Majesty, I never said nor thought
PETER

GLOUCESTER
[Holding up his hands] By these ten bones, my lords, he did
YORK
1
GLOUCESTER
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
KING HENRY
1
GLOUCESTER
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
SOMERSET
1
GLOUCESTER
I humbly thank your royal Majesty.
HORNER
1
GLOUCESTER
And I accept the combat willingly.
PETER
1
GLOUCESTER
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case!
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hang'd.
KING HENRY

GLOUCESTER
Away with them to prison; and the day of combat shall

Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.
BOLINGBROKE

I have heard her reported to be a woman of an

Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this gear, the

Asmath,

Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.
BOLINGBROKE

The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;

'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'

0
By water shall he die and take his end.
BOLINGBROKE

'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
SPIRIT

Let him shun castles:
BOLINGBROKE

Descend to darkness and the burning lake;
YORK
0
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
DUCHESS
0
Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
BUCKINGHAM
0
True, madam, none at all. What can you this?
YORK
0
Lord Buckingham, methinks you watch'd her well.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
YORK
0
At your pleasure, my good lord.
QUEEN
0
Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
KING HENRY
0
But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
SUFFOLK
0
No marvel, an it like your Majesty,
GLOUCESTER
0
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
CARDINAL
0
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, my lord Cardinal, how think you by that?
KING HENRY
0
The treasury of everlasting joy!
CARDINAL
0
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
GLOUCESTER
0
What, Cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
SUFFOLK
0
No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
GLOUCESTER
0
As who, my lord?
SUFFOLK
0
Why, as you, my lord,
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
QUEEN
0
And thy ambition, Gloucester.
KING HENRY
0
I prithee, peace,
CARDINAL
0
Let me be blessed for the peace I make
GLOUCESTER

[Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would 'twere

KING HENRY
0
How now, my lords!
CARDINAL
0
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
GLOUCESTER
0
True, uncle.
CARDINAL
0
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advis'd? The east side of
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.
KING HENRY
0
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
GLOUCESTER
0
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
CARDINAL
0
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Medice, teipsum;
KING HENRY
0
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
GLOUCESTER
0
What means this noise?
TOWNSMAN
0
A miracle! A miracle!
SUFFOLK
0
Come to the King, and tell him what miracle.
TOWNSMAN
0
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Albans shrine
KING HENRY
0
Now God be prais'd that to believing souls
CARDINAL
0
Here comes the townsmen on procession
KING HENRY
0
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
GLOUCESTER
0
Stand by, my masters; bring him near the King;
KING HENRY
0
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
SIMPCOX
0
Born blind, an't please your Grace.
WIFE
0
Ay indeed was he.
SUFFOLK
0
What woman is this?
WIFE
0
His wife, an't like your worship.
GLOUCESTER
0
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better
KING HENRY
0
Where wert thou born?
SIMPCOX
0
At Berwick in the north, an't like your Grace.
KING HENRY
0
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
QUEEN
0
Tell me, good fellow, cam'st thou here by chance,
SIMPCOX
0
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
WIFE
0
Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
CARDINAL
0
What, art thou lame?
SIMPCOX
0
Ay, God Almighty help me!
SUFFOLK
0
How cam'st thou so?
SIMPCOX
0
A fall off of a tree.
WIFE
0
A plum tree, master.
GLOUCESTER
0
How long hast thou been blind?
SIMPCOX
0
O, born so, master!
GLOUCESTER
0
What, and wouldst climb a tree?
SIMPCOX
0
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
WIFE
0
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
GLOUCESTER
0
Mass, thou lov'dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.
SIMPCOX
0
Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
GLOUCESTER
0
A subtle knave! But yet it shall not serve:
SIMPCOX
0
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.
GLOUCESTER
0
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
SIMPCOX
0
Red, master; red as blood.
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
SIMPCOX
0
Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.
KING HENRY
0
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
SUFFOLK
0
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
GLOUCESTER
0
But cloaks and gowns before this day a many.
WIFE
0
Never before this day in all his life.
GLOUCESTER
0
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
SIMPCOX
0
Alas, master, I know not.
GLOUCESTER
0
What's his name?
SIMPCOX
0
I know not.
GLOUCESTER
0
Nor his?
SIMPCOX
0
No, indeed, master.
GLOUCESTER
0
What's thine own name?
SIMPCOX
0
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
GLOUCESTER
0
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lying'st knave in
SIMPCOX
0
O master, that you could!
GLOUCESTER
0
My masters of Saint Albans, have you not beadles in
MAYOR
0
Yes, my lord, if it please your Grace.
GLOUCESTER
0
Then send for one presently.
MAYOR
0
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
GLOUCESTER
0
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. [A stool
SIMPCOX
0
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone!
GLOUCESTER
0
Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.
BEADLE
0
I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet
SIMPCOX
0
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
KING HENRY
0
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
QUEEN
0
It made me laugh to see the villain run.
GLOUCESTER
0
Follow the knave, and take this drab away.
WIFE
0
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!
GLOUCESTER
0
Let them be whipp'd through every market town till they
CARDINAL
0
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
SUFFOLK
0
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
GLOUCESTER
0
But you have done more miracles than I:
KING HENRY
0
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM
0
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold:
CARDINAL
0
And so, my Lord Protector, by this means
GLOUCESTER
0
Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.
KING HENRY
0
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
QUEEN
0
Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest;
GLOUCESTER
0
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal
KING HENRY
0
Well, for this night we will repose us here.
YORK

Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
SALISBURY
0
My lord, I long to hear it at full.
WARWICK
0
Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,
YORK
0
Then thus:
WARWICK
0
Father, the Duke hath told the truth;
YORK
0
Which now they hold by force, and not by right;
SALISBURY
0
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
YORK

The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line

His eldest sister, Anne,

Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King!
YORK

We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
SALISBURY
0
My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
WARWICK
0
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
YORK
0
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,
KING HENRY

Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:
DUCHESS
0
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
GLOUCESTER
0
Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee.
KING HENRY
0
Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester; ere thou go,
QUEEN
0
I see no reason why a king of years
GLOUCESTER

My staff! Here, noble Henry, is my staff.
QUEEN
0
Why, now is Henry King, and Margaret Queen,

Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;

Lords, let him go. Please it your Majesty,
QUEEN

Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore

A God's name, see the lists and all things fit;

Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of

And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour;

Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and a fig
FIRST PRENTICE

Here, Peter, I drink to thee; and be not afraid.
SECOND PRENTICE

Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight

Come, leave your drinking and fall to blows.

Peter? What more?
PETER

Thump.
SALISBURY
0
Thump? Then see thou thump thy master well.
HORNER
0
Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
YORK
0
Dispatch- this knave's tongue begins to double.
HORNER
0
Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
YORK
0
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in
PETER
0
O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O
KING HENRY
0
Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,
GLOUCESTER
0
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud,
GLOUCESTER
0
Ten is the hour that was appointed me
GLOUCESTER
0
No, stir not for your lives; let her pass by.
DUCHESS
0
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
GLOUCESTER
0
Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
DUCHESS
0
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
GLOUCESTER
0
Ah, Nell, forbear! Thou aimest all awry.
HERALD
0
I summon your Grace to his Majesty's Parliament,
GLOUCESTER

And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
SHERIFF

An't please your Grace, here my commission stays;
GLOUCESTER
0
Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
STANLEY
0
So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace.
GLOUCESTER
0
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
DUCHESS
0
What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
GLOUCESTER
0
Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
DUCHESS
0
Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee!
STANLEY
0
Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
DUCHESS
0
That's bad enough, for I am but reproach-
STANLEY
0
Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey's lady;
DUCHESS
0
Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
SHERIFF
0
It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.
DUCHESS
0
Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharg'd.
STANLEY
0
Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
DUCHESS
0
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet.
KING HENRY
0
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come.
QUEEN
0
Can you not see, or will ye not observe
SUFFOLK
0
Well hath your Highness seen into this duke;
CARDINAL
0
Did he not, contrary to form of law,
YORK
0
And did he not, in his protectorship,
BUCKINGHAM
0
Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown
KING HENRY
0
My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
QUEEN
0
Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance?
SOMERSET
0
All health unto my gracious sovereign!
KING HENRY
0
Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
SOMERSET
0
That all your interest in those territories
KING HENRY
0
Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's will be done!
YORK
0
[Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France
GLOUCESTER
0
All happiness unto my lord the King!
SUFFOLK
0
Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
GLOUCESTER
0
Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
YORK
0
'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France
GLOUCESTER
0
Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?
CARDINAL
0
It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
GLOUCESTER
0
I say no more than truth, so help me God!
YORK
0
In your protectorship you did devise
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, 'tis well known that whiles I was Protector
SUFFOLK
0
My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer'd;
KING HENRY
0
My Lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
GLOUCESTER
0
Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous!
CARDINAL
0
My liege, his railing is intolerable.
SUFFOLK
0
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
QUEEN
0
But I can give the loser leave to chide.
GLOUCESTER
0
Far truer spoke than meant: I lose indeed.
BUCKINGHAM
0
He'll wrest the sense, and hold us here all day.
CARDINAL
0
Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.
GLOUCESTER
0
Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch
KING HENRY
0
My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best
QUEEN
0
What, will your Highness leave the Parliament?
KING HENRY
0
Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
QUEEN
0
Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams:
CARDINAL
0
That he should die is worthy policy;
SUFFOLK
0
But, in my mind, that were no policy:
YORK
0
So that, by this, you would not have him die.
SUFFOLK
0
Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
YORK
0
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
QUEEN
0
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
SUFFOLK
0
Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness then
QUEEN
0
Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
SUFFOLK
0
Not resolute, except so much were done,
CARDINAL
0
But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,
SUFFOLK
0
Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing.
QUEEN
0
And so say I.
YORK
0
And I. And now we three have spoke it,
POST
0
Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain
CARDINAL
0
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
YORK
0
That Somerset be sent as Regent thither;
SOMERSET
0
If York, with all his far-fet policy,
YORK
0
No, not to lose it all as thou hast done.
QUEEN
0
Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
YORK
0
What, worse than nought? Nay, then a shame take all!
SOMERSET
0
And in the number, thee that wishest shame!
CARDINAL
0
My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
YORK
0
I will, my lord, so please his Majesty.
SUFFOLK
0
Why, our authority is his consent,
YORK
0
I am content; provide me soldiers, lords,
SUFFOLK
0
A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
CARDINAL
0
No more of him; for I will deal with him

FIRST MURDERER

Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
SECOND MURDERER

O that it were to do! What have we done?
FIRST MURDERER
0
Here comes my lord.
SUFFOLK
0
Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
FIRST MURDERER
0
Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
SUFFOLK
0
Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;
FIRST MURDERER

'Tis, my good lord.

Away! be gone.                       Exeunt MURDERERS

KING HENRY

SUFFOLK
I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Marry, God forfend!
CARDINAL
1
SUFFOLK
God's secret judgment! I did dream to-night
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
How fares my lord? Help, lords! The King is dead.
SOMERSET
1
SUFFOLK
Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
He doth revive again; madam, be patient.
KING

SUFFOLK
O heavenly God!
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
How fares my gracious lord?
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort!
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
It is reported, mighty sovereign,
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
WARWICK

SUFFOLK
That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
WARWICK

SUFFOLK
That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,

SUFFOLK
O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts-
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
That is to see how deep my grave is made;
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
As surely as my soul intends to live
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
See how the blood is settled in his face.
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes;
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
    But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
    That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
    That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
    Say if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
    That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.

What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
QUEEN

SUFFOLK
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,

SUFFOLK
Madam, be still- with reverence may I say;
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanour,
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,
WARWICK
1
SUFFOLK
Away even now, or I will drag thee hence.

What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?
QUEEN

What noise is this?

Why, how now, lords, your wrathful weapons drawn

Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me
    I thank them for their tender loving care;
    And had I not been cited so by them,
    Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
    For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
    Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means.
    And therefore by His Majesty I swear,
    Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
    He shall not breathe infection in this air
    But three days longer, on the pain of death.

QUEEN

SUFFOLK
O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
Ungentle Queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
KING HENRY
1
SUFFOLK
Ungentle Queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
    No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him,
    Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
    Had I but said, I would have kept my word;
    But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
    If after three days' space thou here be'st found
    On any ground that I am ruler of,
    The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
    Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
    I have great matters to impart to thee.
                                Exeunt all but QUEEN and SUFFOLK
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Cease, gentle Queen, these execrations,
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch,
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them?
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself;
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
O, let me entreat thee cease! Give me thy hand,
SUFFOLK
1
SUFFOLK
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?
VAUX

SUFFOLK
To signify unto his Majesty
QUEEN

Go tell this heavy message to the King.       Exit VAUX

If I depart from thee I cannot live;

Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,

SUFFOLK
I go.
QUEEN
1
SUFFOLK
And take my heart with thee.           [She kisses him]
SUFFOLK

A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask
QUEEN

SUFFOLK
This way for me.                       Exeunt severally
KING HENRY

How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.
CARDINAL
0
If thou be'st Death I'll give thee England's treasure,
KING HENRY
0
Ah, what a sign it is of evil life
WARWICK
0
Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
CARDINAL
0
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
KING HENRY
0
O Thou eternal Mover of the heavens,
WARWICK
0
See how the pangs of death do make him grin
SALISBURY
0
Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.
KING HENRY
0
Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
WARWICK

So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
KING HENRY
0
Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
LIEUTENANT

The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
What is my ransom, master, let me know?
MASTER
0
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
MATE
0
And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
LIEUTENANT
0
What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
I'll give it, sir: and therefore spare my life.
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
And so will I, and write home for it straight.
WHITMORE
0
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
LIEUTENANT
0
Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
SUFFOLK
0
Look on my George, I am a gentleman:
WHITMORE
0
And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.
SUFFOLK
0
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
WHITMORE
0
Gualtier or Walter, which it is I care not:
SUFFOLK
0
Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
WHITMORE
0
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?
SUFFOLK
0
Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke:
LIEUTENANT
0
But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
SUFFOLK
0
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
WHITMORE
0
Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
LIEUTENANT
0
First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
SUFFOLK
0
Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
LIEUTENANT
0
Convey him hence, and on our longboat's side
SUFFOLK
0
Thou dar'st not, for thy own.
LIEUTENANT
0
Poole!
SUFFOLK
0
Poole?
LIEUTENANT

Ay, kennel, puddle, sink, whose filth and dirt
SUFFOLK

O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
LIEUTENANT

Walter-
WHITMORE
0
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
SUFFOLK
0
Gelidus timor occupat artus: it is thee I fear.
WHITMORE
0
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
SUFFOLK
0
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stem and rough,
LIEUTENANT
0
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
SUFFOLK
0
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
LIEUTENANT
0
And as for these, whose ransom we have set,
LIEUTENANT

WHITMORE
And as for these, whose ransom we have set,
    It is our pleasure one of them depart;
    Therefore come you with us, and let him go.

O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.

The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
GEORGE

Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
JOHN
0
True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is
GEORGE
0
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave
JOHN

I see them! I see them! There's Best's son, the tanner of

He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's
JOHN

And Dick the butcher-
GEORGE

Then is sin struck down, like an ox, and iniquity's throat
JOHN

And Smith the weaver-
GEORGE

Argo, their thread of life is spun.
JOHN

Come, come, let's fall in with them.
CADE

We John Cade, so term'd of our supposed father-

For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with the

Silence!

My father was a Mortimer-

My mother a Plantagenet-
DICK

CADE
0
My wife descended of the Lacies-

[Aside] She was, indeed, a pedlar's daughter, and sold many

Valiant I am.

[Aside] 'A must needs; for beggary is valiant.
CADE

I am able to endure much.
DICK

[Aside] No question of that; for I have seen him whipt three

I fear neither sword nor fire.
SMITH

The clerk of Chatham. He can write and read and cast
CADE

O monstrous!
SMITH
0
We took him setting of boys' copies.
CADE
0
Here's a villain!
SMITH
0
Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
CADE
0
Nay, then he is a conjurer.
DICK
0
Nay, he can make obligations and write court-hand.
CADE

I am sorry for't; the man is a proper man, of mine honour;
CLERK

They use to write it on the top of letters; 'twill go hard

Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He shall be

To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.
STAFFORD
0
Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
WILLIAM STAFFORD

But angry, wrathful, and inclin'd to blood,
CADE

As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not;
STAFFORD
0
Villain, thy father was a plasterer;
CADE
0
And Adam was a gardener.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
0
And what of that?
CADE
0
Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March,
STAFFORD
0
Ay, sir.
CADE
0
By her he had two children at one birth.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
0
That's false.
CADE
0
Ay, there's the question; but I say 'tis true.
DICK

Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.

Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks

And will you credit this base drudge's words
ALL

Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
WILLIAM STAFFORD

Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
CADE
0
[Aside] He lies, for I invented it myself- Go to, sirrah,
DICK
0
And furthermore, we'll have the Lord Say's head for selling
CADE

And good reason; for thereby is England main'd and fain to go
STAFFORD
0
O gross and miserable ignorance!
CADE
0
Nay, answer if you can; the Frenchmen are our enemies. Go to,
ALL

No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
WILLIAM STAFFORD

Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,

Herald, away; and throughout every town

And you that love the commons follow me.
DICK
0
They are all in order, and march toward us.
CADE

But then are we in order when we are most out of order. Come,

Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?
DICK

Here, sir.

They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou behavedst

And, to speak truth, thou deserv'st no less. [Putting on SIR

Ay, but I hope your Highness shall have his.

No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;
CADE
0
Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a sword and yet am
IDEN
0
Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court
CADE
0
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for
IDEN
0
Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
CADE
0
Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broach'd, and
IDEN
0
Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
CADE
0
By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard!
IDEN
0
Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
CADE
0
Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from
IDEN
0
How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
YORK
0
From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
BUCKINGHAM
0
York, if thou meanest well I greet thee well.
YORK
0
Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
BUCKINGHAM
0
A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,
YORK
0
[Aside] Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great.
BUCKINGHAM
0
That is too much presumption on thy part;
YORK
0
Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
BUCKINGHAM
0
Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
YORK
0
Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my pow'rs.
BUCKINGHAM
0
York, I commend this kind submission.
KING HENRY
0
Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
YORK
0
In all submission and humility
KING HENRY
0
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
YORK
0
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
IDEN
0
If one so rude and of so mean condition
KING HENRY
0
The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!
IDEN
0
I was, an't like your Majesty.
KING HENRY
0
How art thou call'd? And what is thy degree?
IDEN
0
Alexander Iden, that's my name;
BUCKINGHAM
0
So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
KING HENRY
0
Iden, kneel down. [He kneels] Rise up a knight.
IDEN
0
May Iden live to merit such a bounty,
KING HENRY
0
See, Buckingham! Somerset comes with th' Queen:
QUEEN
0
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
YORK
0
How now! Is Somerset at liberty?
SOMERSET
0
O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
YORK
0
Wouldst have me kneel? First let me ask of these,
QUEEN
0
Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,
YORK
0
O blood-bespotted Neapolitan,
QUEEN
0
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
CLIFFORD
0
Health and all happiness to my lord the King!
YORK
0
I thank thee, Clifford. Say, what news with thee?
CLIFFORD
0
This is my King, York, I do not mistake;
KING HENRY
0
Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
CLIFFORD
0
He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,
QUEEN
0
He is arrested, but will not obey;
YORK
0
Will you not, sons?
EDWARD
0
Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
RICHARD
0
And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
CLIFFORD
0
Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
YORK
0
Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
CLIFFORD
0
Are these thy bears? We'll bait thy bears to death,
RICHARD
0
Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur
CLIFFORD
0
Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
YORK
0
Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
CLIFFORD
0
Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
KING HENRY
0
Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
SALISBURY
0
My lord, I have considered with myself
KING HENRY
0
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
SALISBURY
0
I have.
KING HENRY
0
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
SALISBURY
0
It is great sin to swear unto a sin;
QUEEN
0
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
KING HENRY
0
Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
YORK
0
Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
CLIFFORD
0
The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
WARWICK
0
You were best to go to bed and dream again
CLIFFORD
0
I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
WARWICK
0
Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
CLIFFORD
0
And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
YOUNG CLIFFORD
0
And so to arms, victorious father,
RICHARD
0
Fie! charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,
YOUNG CLIFFORD
0
Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
RICHARD
0
If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.
WARWICK
0
Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls;
YORK
0
The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed;
WARWICK
0
Of one or both of us the time is come.
YORK
0
Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
WARWICK
0
Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
CLIFFORD
0
What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?
YORK
0
With thy brave bearing should I be in love
CLIFFORD
0
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
YORK
0
So let it help me now against thy sword,
CLIFFORD
0
My soul and body on the action both!
YORK
0
A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
CLIFFORD
0
La fin couronne les oeuvres.                  [Dies]
YORK
0
Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.
YOUNG CLIFFORD
0
Shame and confusion! All is on the rout;
RICHARD
0
So, lie thou there;
QUEEN
0
Away, my lord! You are slow; for shame, away!
KING HENRY
0
Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.
QUEEN
0
What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.
QUEEN
1
CLIFFORD
What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.
    Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,
    To give the enemy way, and to secure us
    By what we can, which can no more but fly.
                                               [Alarum afar off]
    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-
    As well we may, if not through your neglect-
    We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,
    And where this breach now in our fortunes made
    May readily be stopp'd.
YOUNG CLIFFORD
1
CLIFFORD
But that my heart's on future mischief set,
YORK
0
Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
RICHARD
0
My noble father,
SALISBURY
0
Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day!
YORK
0
I know our safety is to follow them;
WARWICK
0
After them? Nay, before them, if we can.
