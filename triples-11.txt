    So, let her rest. And, madam, list to me,
    For I am bold to counsel you in this:
    Although we fancy not the Cardinal,
    Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
    Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
    As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
    Will make but little for his benefit.

  QUEEN. 
3
KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

    My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
    Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
    If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;
    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
    Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
    With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
    But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
    And to survey his dead and earthy image,
    What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

  WHITMORE.

LIEUTENANT

LIEUTENANT
EUTENANT. Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.

LIEUTENANT

LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.

  SUFFOLK. 
1
LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
  WHITMORE. 
1
LIEUTENANT
ITMORE. The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?
  SUFFOLK. 
1
LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke:
  LIEUTENANT. 
1
LIEUTENANT
EUTENANT. But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
  SUFFOLK. 
1
LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
  WHITMORE. 
1
LIEUTENANT
ITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
  LIEUTENANT. 
1
LIEUTENANT
EUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
  SUFFOLK.

  WHITMORE. 
1
LIEUTENANT

  FIRST 
1
LIEUTENANT
RST GENTLEMAN. My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
  SUFFOLK. 
1
LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Suffolk's imperial tongue is stem and rough,

LIEUTENANT
EUTENANT. Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
  SUFFOLK. 
1
LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
  SUFFOLK. 
1
LIEUTENANT
FFOLK. Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
    That this my death may never be forgot-
    Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
    A Roman sworder and banditto slave
    Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
    Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders
    Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.

  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the

  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.
  JOHN. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
HN. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
  JOHN. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
HN. True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is
  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave
  JOHN. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
HN. I see them! I see them! There's Best's son, the tanner of
  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's
  JOHN. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
HN. And Dick the butcher-
  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. Then is sin struck down, like an ox, and iniquity's throat
  JOHN. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
HN. And Smith the weaver-
  GEORGE. 
1
GEORGE BEVIS
ORGE. Argo, their thread of life is spun.
  JOHN.

GEORGE BEVIS
CADE
CLERK OF CHATHAM
DE. Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that
    of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That
    parchment, being scribbl'd o'er, should undo a man? Some say the
    bee stings; but I say 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal once

    there?
  SMITH.

    am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a
    thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick
    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'
    must serve me to feed on.

KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

    Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
    If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;
    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
    Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
    With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
    But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
    And to survey his dead and earthy image,

    durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now
    am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a
    thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick
    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'
    must serve me to feed on.

    Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
    He that is truly dedicate to war

    To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
    The silver livery of advised age,
    And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
    To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
    My heart is turn'd to stone; and while 'tis mine
    It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
    No more will I their babes. Tears virginal
    Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;

    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;

KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
    Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
    With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
    But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
    And to survey his dead and earthy image,
    What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

DE. Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a sword and yet am
    ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these woods and
    durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now
    am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a
    thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick
    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'
    must serve me to feed on.

    Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.

    No more will I their babes. Tears virginal
    Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;

    Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
    Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
    Meet I an infant of the house of York,
    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;
    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
    Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house;
    As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,
    So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
    But then Aeneas bare a living load,

    For I am bold to counsel you in this:
    Although we fancy not the Cardinal,
    Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
    Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
    As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
    Will make but little for his benefit.

KING
SUFFOLK
NG HENRY. Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
  QUEEN. 
2
KING
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
  QUEEN. 
3
KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
NG HENRY. O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts-
    My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
    Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
    If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;
    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
    Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
    With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
    But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
    And to survey his dead and earthy image,
    What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
FFOLK. I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
    But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
    That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
    That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
    Say if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
    That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.

    No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him,
    Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
    Had I but said, I would have kept my word;
    But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
    If after three days' space thou here be'st found

    am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a

    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'

    Meet I an infant of the house of York,
    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;
    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
    Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house;
    As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,
    So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
    But then Aeneas bare a living load,

KING

SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;

    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'

    Whom angry heavens do make their minister,
    Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
    Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
    He that is truly dedicate to war
    Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself
    Hath not essentially, but by circumstance,
    The name of valour.                 [Sees his father's body]
    O, let the vile world end
    And the premised flames of the last day
    Knit earth and heaven together!
    Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
    Particularities and petty sounds
    To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,
    To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
    The silver livery of advised age,
    And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
    To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
    My heart is turn'd to stone; and while 'tis mine
    It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
    No more will I their babes. Tears virginal
    Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;
    And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,
    Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
    Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
    Meet I an infant of the house of York,
    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;
    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
    Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house;
    As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,
    So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
    But then Aeneas bare a living load,
    Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.

KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
    Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
    With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
    But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
    And to survey his dead and earthy image,
    What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

    am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a
    thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick
    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'

    So, let her rest. And, madam, list to me,
    For I am bold to counsel you in this:
    Although we fancy not the Cardinal,
    Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
    Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
    As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
    Will make but little for his benefit.

KING
WARWICK
SUFFOLK
EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
    What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face?
    I am no loathsome leper- look on me.
    What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
    Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn Queen.
    Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
    Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
    Erect his statue and worship it,
    And make my image but an alehouse sign.
    Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea,
    And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
    Drove back again unto my native clime?
    What boded this but well-forewarning wind
    Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
    Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
    What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts,
    And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
    And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
    But left that hateful office unto thee.
    The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me,
    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
    With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;
    The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
    And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
    And when the dusky sky began to rob
    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
    I took a costly jewel from my neck-
    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
    And even with this I lost fair England's view,
    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-
    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-
    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
    When he to madding Dido would unfold
    His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy!
    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
    Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret,
    For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

    Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
    If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;
    For judgment only doth belong to Thee.
    Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
    With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
    But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
    And to survey his dead and earthy image,
    What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

    am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a

    wall have I climb'd into this garden, to see if I can eat grass
    or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a
    man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
    was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my
    brain-pain had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time,
    when I have been dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me
    instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'

    Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.

    To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight

    No more will I their babes. Tears virginal
    Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;

    Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
    Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
    Meet I an infant of the house of York,
    Into as many gobbets will I cut it
    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;
    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
    Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house;
    As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,
    So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
    But then Aeneas bare a living load,

NG HENRY. For my part, noble lords, I care not which:

MERSET. If Somerset be unworthy of the place,

RWICK. Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,

RDINAL. Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
  WARWICK.

RWICK. The Cardinal's not my better in the field.

RWICK. Warwick may live to be the best of all.

  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. Madam, I am Protector of the realm;
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Resign it then, and leave thine insolence.
  CARDINAL.

RDINAL. The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
  SOMERSET.

MERSET. Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. Thy cruelty in execution
  QUEEN.

RWICK. That can I witness; and a fouler fact
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Peace, headstrong Warwick!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Because here is a man accus'd of treason:
  YORK. 
0

  KING

NG HENRY. What mean'st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Please it your Majesty, this is the man
  KING

  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. I humbly thank your royal Majesty.
  HORNER. 
0
RNER. And I accept the combat willingly.
  PETER. 
0
TER. Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hang'd.
  KING

NG HENRY. Away with them to prison; and the day of combat shall

LINGBROKE. Master Hume, we are therefore provided; will her
  HUME.

IRIT. Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. [Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
  SPIRIT. 
0
IRIT. The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
  BOLINGBROKE.

LINGBROKE. 'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
  SPIRIT.

LINGBROKE. 'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
  SPIRIT.

IRIT. Let him shun castles:
  BOLINGBROKE.

  DUCHESS. 
0
CHESS. Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. True, madam, none at all. What can you this?
  YORK. 
0

  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
  YORK.

  QUEEN.

EEN. Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
  KING

NG HENRY. But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. No marvel, an it like your Majesty,
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
  CARDINAL.

OUCESTER. Ay, my lord Cardinal, how think you by that?
  KING

NG HENRY. The treasury of everlasting joy!
  CARDINAL.

RDINAL. Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. What, Cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. As who, my lord?
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Why, as you, my lord,
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
  QUEEN.

EEN. And thy ambition, Gloucester.
  KING

MPCOX. Ay, God Almighty help me!
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. How cam'st thou so?
  SIMPCOX.

OUCESTER. How long hast thou been blind?
  SIMPCOX. 
0
MPCOX. O, born so, master!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. What, and wouldst climb a tree?
  SIMPCOX. 
0
MPCOX. But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
  WIFE.

FE. Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Mass, thou lov'dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.
  SIMPCOX. 
0
MPCOX. Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. A subtle knave! But yet it shall not serve:

OUCESTER. Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?

MPCOX. Red, master; red as blood.

OUCESTER. Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
  SIMPCOX.

MPCOX. Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.
  KING

NG HENRY. Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. But cloaks and gowns before this day a many.

  QUEEN.

EEN. How fares my lord? Help, lords! The King is dead.
  SOMERSET.

EEN. Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort!
  KING

EEN. Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
  KING

NG HENRY. Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
  QUEEN.

EEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
  WARWICK.

RWICK. It is reported, mighty sovereign,
  KING

NG HENRY. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
  WARWICK.

RWICK. That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
  KING

NG HENRY. O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts-

NG HENRY. That is to see how deep my grave is made;

FFOLK. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
  WARWICK.

RWICK. See how the blood is settled in his face.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?
  WARWICK.

RWICK. But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes;

RWICK. Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,

EEN. Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;

FFOLK. You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
  QUEEN.

  KING

RWICK. See how the pangs of death do make him grin
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
  WARWICK.

  FIRST

RST GENTLEMAN. What is my ransom, master, let me know?
  MASTER.

STER. A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
  MATE. 
0
TE. And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. I'll give it, sir: and therefore spare my life.
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. And so will I, and write home for it straight.
  WHITMORE. 
0
ITMORE. I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Look on my George, I am a gentleman:
  WHITMORE. 
0
ITMORE. And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
  WHITMORE. 
0
ITMORE. Gualtier or Walter, which it is I care not:
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
  WHITMORE. 
0
ITMORE. The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke:
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
  WHITMORE. 
0
ITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. Convey him hence, and on our longboat's side
  SUFFOLK. 
0
FFOLK. Thou dar'st not, for thy own.
  LIEUTENANT.

EUTENANT. Poole!

0
EUTENANT. Walter-
  WHITMORE.

ITMORE. Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Gelidus timor occupat artus: it is thee I fear.
  WHITMORE. 
0
ITMORE. Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Suffolk's imperial tongue is stem and rough,
  LIEUTENANT.

EUTENANT. Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
  LIEUTENANT.

EUTENANT. And as for these, whose ransom we have set,

  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
  GEORGE.

ORGE. Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
  JOHN. 
0
HN. True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave
  JOHN.

HN. I see them! I see them! There's Best's son, the tanner of
  GEORGE.

ORGE. He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's
  JOHN.

HN. And Dick the butcher-
  GEORGE.

ORGE. Then is sin struck down, like an ox, and iniquity's throat
  JOHN.

CKINGHAM. Health and glad tidings to your Majesty!
  KING

NG HENRY. Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surpris'd?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield,

NG HENRY. Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,
  ALL.

L. God save the King! God save the King!
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Please it your Grace to be advertised
  KING

NG HENRY. Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd;
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lord,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. In any case be not too rough in terms,
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;
  CADE. 
0
DE. Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a sword and yet am
  IDEN.

EN. Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court
  CADE.

EN. Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
  CADE. 
0
DE. Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broach'd, and
  IDEN. 
0
EN. Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
  CADE. 
0
DE. By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard!
  IDEN. 
0
EN. Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
  CADE. 
0
DE. Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from
  IDEN. 
0
EN. How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
  YORK. 
0
RK. From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. York, if thou meanest well I greet thee well.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,
  YORK. 
0
RK. [Aside] Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great.
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. That is too much presumption on thy part;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my pow'rs.
  BUCKINGHAM. 
0
CKINGHAM. York, I commend this kind submission.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
  YORK. 
0
RK. In all submission and humility
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
  YORK. 
0
RK. To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
  IDEN. 
0
EN. If one so rude and of so mean condition
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!
  IDEN. 
0
EN. I was, an't like your Majesty.
  KING

NG HENRY. How art thou call'd? And what is thy degree?
  IDEN.

  BUCKINGHAM.

CKINGHAM. So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Iden, kneel down. [He kneels] Rise up a knight.
  IDEN. 
0
EN. May Iden live to merit such a bounty,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. See, Buckingham! Somerset comes with th' Queen:
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
  YORK. 
0
RK. How now! Is Somerset at liberty?
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Wouldst have me kneel? First let me ask of these,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain,
  YORK. 
0
RK. O blood-bespotted Neapolitan,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Health and all happiness to my lord the King!
  YORK. 
0
RK. I thank thee, Clifford. Say, what news with thee?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. This is my King, York, I do not mistake;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. He is arrested, but will not obey;
  YORK. 
0
RK. Will you not, sons?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Are these thy bears? We'll bait thy bears to death,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. My lord, I have considered with myself
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. I have.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is great sin to swear unto a sin;
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. You were best to go to bed and dream again
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
  YOUNG 
0
UNG CLIFFORD. And so to arms, victorious father,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Fie! charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,
  YOUNG 
0
UNG CLIFFORD. Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls;
  WARWICK 
0
RWICK is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
  YORK. 
0
RK. The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Of one or both of us the time is come.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?
  YORK. 
0
RK. With thy brave bearing should I be in love
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
  YORK. 
0
RK. So let it help me now against thy sword,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My soul and body on the action both!
  YORK. 
0
RK. A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. La fin couronne les oeuvres.                  [Dies]
  YORK.

RK. Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.
  YOUNG

UNG CLIFFORD. Shame and confusion! All is on the rout;
  RICHARD.

CHARD. So, lie thou there;
  QUEEN.

EEN. Away, my lord! You are slow; for shame, away!
  KING

NG HENRY. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.
  QUEEN.

EEN. What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.
  YOUNG

  RICHARD.

LISBURY. Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day!

MERSET. Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
  BUCKINGHAM.

    Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
    For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
    Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means.
    And therefore by His Majesty I swear,
    Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
    He shall not breathe infection in this air
    But three days longer, on the pain of death.

SUFFOLK
NG HENRY. Ungentle Queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
    No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him,
    Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
    Had I but said, I would have kept my word;
    But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
    If after three days' space thou here be'st found
    On any ground that I am ruler of,
    The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
    Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
    I have great matters to impart to thee.

SUFFOLK
EEN. Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself;

  QUEEN.

SUFFOLK
EEN. O, let me entreat thee cease! Give me thy hand,

EUTENANT. But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.

  LIEUTENANT.

EUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me.

  YORK.

0
IFFORD. This is my King, York, I do not mistake;
  KING

NG HENRY. Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,

  YORK.

  EDWARD. 
0

  KING

  SALISBURY.

LISBURY. I have.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is great sin to swear unto a sin;
  QUEEN.

  KING

  YORK.

  WARWICK.

RWICK. Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls;
  WARWICK

RWICK is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
  YORK.

  YORK.

  WARWICK.

RWICK. Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
  CLIFFORD.

  YORK.

  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
  YORK.

    Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,
    To give the enemy way, and to secure us

    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-

LISBURY. Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.
  KING

ITMORE. And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
  WHITMORE.

ITMORE. Gualtier or Walter, which it is I care not:

FFOLK. Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
  WHITMORE.

ITMORE. The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?
  SUFFOLK.

FFOLK. Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke:
  LIEUTENANT.

EUTENANT. But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
  SUFFOLK.

ITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me.

ITMORE. Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
  FIRST

RST GENTLEMAN. My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
  SUFFOLK.

  JOHN.

ORGE. He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's
  JOHN.

  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,
  QUEEN.

  YORK. 
0

  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. Are these thy bears? We'll bait thy bears to death,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur
  CLIFFORD.

  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
  KING

  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. My lord, I have considered with myself
  KING

NG HENRY. Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. I have.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
  SALISBURY. 
0
LISBURY. It is great sin to swear unto a sin;
  QUEEN. 
0
EEN. A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
  YORK. 
0

  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
  WARWICK.

RWICK. You were best to go to bed and dream again
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
  WARWICK.

RWICK. Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear

CHARD. Fie! charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,
  YOUNG 
0
UNG CLIFFORD. Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls;
  WARWICK 
0
RWICK is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
  YORK. 
0
RK. The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Of one or both of us the time is come.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?
  YORK.

  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
  YORK.

  CLIFFORD.

  YORK.

CLIFFORD
EEN. What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.
    Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,
    To give the enemy way, and to secure us
    By what we can, which can no more but fly.
                                               [Alarum afar off]
    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-
    As well we may, if not through your neglect-
    We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,
    And where this breach now in our fortunes made
    May readily be stopp'd.

MERSET. Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
  BUCKINGHAM.

  LIEUTENANT.

EUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me.

EEN. What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.
    Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,
    To give the enemy way, and to secure us

    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-
    As well we may, if not through your neglect-
    We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,
    And where this breach now in our fortunes made
    May readily be stopp'd.
