If music be the food of love, play on,
CURIO
0
Will you go hunt, my lord?
DUKE
0
What, Curio?
CURIO
0
The hart.
DUKE
0
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
VALENTINE
0
So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
DUKE
0
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
VIOLA
0
What country, friends, is this?
CAPTAIN
0
This is Illyria, lady.
VIOLA
0
And what should I do in Illyria?
CAPTAIN
0
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
VIOLA
0
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
CAPTAIN
0
True, madam, and, to comfort you with chance,
VIOLA
0
For saying so, there's gold.
CAPTAIN
0
Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
VIOLA
0
Who governs here?
CAPTAIN
0
A noble duke, in nature as in name.
VIOLA
0
What is his name?
CAPTAIN
0
Orsino.
VIOLA
0
Orsino! I have heard my father name him.
CAPTAIN
0
And so is now, or was so very late;
VIOLA
0
What's she?
CAPTAIN
0
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
VIOLA
0
O that I serv'd that lady,
CAPTAIN
0
That were hard to compass,
VIOLA
0
There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;
CAPTAIN
0
Be you his eunuch and your mute I'll be;
VIOLA
0
I thank thee. Lead me on.                        Exeunt
SIR TOBY
0
What a plague means my niece to take the death of her
MARIA
0
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights;
SIR TOBY
0
Why, let her except before excepted.
MARIA
0
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits
SIR TOBY
0
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These
MARIA
0
That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady
SIR TOBY
0
Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
MARIA
0
Ay, he.
SIR TOBY
0
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
MARIA
0
What's that to th' purpose?
SIR TOBY
0
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
MARIA
0
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a
SIR TOBY
0
Fie that you'll say so! He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys,
MARIA
0
He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a
SIR TOBY
0
By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that
MARIA
0
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
SIR TOBY
0
With drinking healths to my niece; I'll drink to her as
AGUECHEEK
0
Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!
SIR TOBY
0
Sweet Sir Andrew!
AGUECHEEK
0
Bless you, fair shrew.
MARIA
0
And you too, sir.
SIR TOBY
0
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
AGUECHEEK
0
What's that?
SIR TOBY
0
My niece's chambermaid.
AGUECHEEK
0
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
MARIA
0
My name is Mary, sir.
AGUECHEEK
0
Good Mistress Mary Accost-
SIR Toby
0
You mistake, knight. 'Accost' is front her, board her,
AGUECHEEK
0
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.
MARIA
0
Fare you well, gentlemen.
SIR TOBY
0
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never
AGUECHEEK
0
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw
MARIA
0
Sir, I have not you by th' hand.
AGUECHEEK
0
Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
MARIA
0
Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to
AGUECHEEK
0
Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your metaphor?
MARIA
0
It's dry, sir.
AGUECHEEK
0
Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my
MARIA
0
A dry jest, sir.
AGUECHEEK
0
Are you full of them?
MARIA
0
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends; marry, now I let
SIR TOBY
0
O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary! When did I see
AGUECHEEK
0
Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put
SIR TOBY
0
No question.
AGUECHEEK
0
An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home
SIR TOBY
0
Pourquoi, my dear knight?
AGUECHEEK
0
What is 'pourquoi'- do or not do? I would I had bestowed
SIR TOBY
0
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
AGUECHEEK
0
Why, would that have mended my hair?
SIR TOBY
0
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
AGUECHEEK
0
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
SIR TOBY
0
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to
AGUECHEEK
0
Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will
SIR TOBY
0
She'll none o' th' Count; she'll not match above her
AGUECHEEK
0
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th' strangest
SIR TOBY
0
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
AGUECHEEK
0
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
SIR TOBY
0
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
AGUECHEEK
0
Faith, I can cut a caper.
SIR TOBY
0
And I can cut the mutton to't.
AGUECHEEK
0
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as
SIR TOBY
0
Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these
AGUECHEEK
0
Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in
SIR TOBY
0
What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?
AGUECHEEK
0
Taurus? That's sides and heart.
SIR TOBY
0
No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper. Ha,
VALENTINE
0
If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario,
VIOLA
0
You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call
VALENTINE
0
No, believe me.
VIOLA
0
I thank you. Here comes the Count.
DUKE
0
Who saw Cesario, ho?
VIOLA
0
On your attendance, my lord, here.
DUKE
0
Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,
VIOLA
0
Sure, my noble lord,
DUKE
0
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,
VIOLA
0
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
DUKE
0
O, then unfold the passion of my love,
VIOLA
0
I think not so, my lord.
DUKE
0
Dear lad, believe it,
VIOLA
0
I'll do my best
MARIA
0
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open
CLOWN
0
Let her hang me. He that is well hang'd in this world needs
MARIA
0
Make that good.
CLOWN
0
He shall see none to fear.
MARIA
0
A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was
CLOWN
0
Where, good Mistress Mary?
MARIA
0
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your
CLOWN
0
Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are
MARIA
0
Yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent; or to be
CLOWN
0
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning
MARIA
0
You are resolute, then?
CLOWN
0
Not so, neither; but I am resolv'd on two points.
MARIA
0
That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break,
CLOWN
0
Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby
MARIA
0
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady. Make
CLOWN
0
Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits
OLIVIA
0
Take the fool away.
CLOWN
0
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
OLIVIA
0
Go to, y'are a dry fool; I'll no more of you. Besides, you
CLOWN
0
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend;
OLIVIA
0
Sir, I bade them take away you.
CLOWN
0
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, 'Cucullus non facit
OLIVIA
0
Can you do it?
CLOWN
0
Dexteriously, good madonna.
OLIVIA
0
Make your proof.
CLOWN
0
I must catechize you for it, madonna.
OLIVIA
0
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your
CLOWN
0
Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?
OLIVIA
0
Good fool, for my brother's death.
CLOWN
0
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
OLIVIA
0
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
CLOWN
0
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul
OLIVIA
0
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?
MALVOLIO
0
Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him.
CLOWN
0
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better
OLIVIA
0
How say you to that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
0
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren
OLIVIA
0
O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a
CLOWN
0
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well
CLOWN
1
MARIA
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well
    of fools!
MARIA
1
MARIA
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires
OLIVIA
1
MARIA
From the Count Orsino, is it?
MARIA
1
MARIA
I know not, madam; 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
OLIVIA
1
MARIA
Who of my people hold him in delay?
MARIA
1
MARIA
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
OLIVIA
1
MARIA
Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman.
CLOWN
0
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should
OLIVIA
0
By mine honour, half drunk! What is he at the gate, cousin?
SIR TOBY
0
A gentleman.
OLIVIA
0
A gentleman! What gentleman?
SIR TOBY
0
'Tis a gentleman here. [Hiccups] A plague o' these
CLOWN
0
Good Sir Toby!
OLIVIA
0
Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this
SIR TOBY
0
Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
OLIVIA
0
Ay, marry; what is he?
SIR TOBY
0
Let him be the devil an he will, I care not; give me
OLIVIA
0
What's a drunken man like, fool?
CLOWN
0
Like a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above
OLIVIA
0
Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz;
CLOWN
0
He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the
CLOWN
1
MALVOLIO
He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the
    madman.                                                 Exit
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Has been told so; and he says he'll stand at your door
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
What kind o' man is he?
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Why, of mankind.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
What manner of man?
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Of what personage and years is he?
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy;
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
MALVOLIO
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.                     Exit
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Give me my veil; come, throw it o'er my face;
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty- I pray you
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Whence came you, sir?
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
I can say little more than I have studied, and that
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Are you a comedian?
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
If I do not usurp myself, I am.
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Come to what is important in't. I forgive you the praise.
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I
MARIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer.
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Tell me your mind.
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
I am a messenger.
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?
VIOLA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my
OLIVIA
2
MALVOLIO
MARIA
Give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.
    [Exeunt MARIA and ATTENDANTS] Now, sir, what is your text?
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
Most sweet lady-
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
In Orsino's bosom.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
To answer by the method: in the first of his heart.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
Good madam, let me see your face.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
Excellently done, if God did all.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
OLIVIA

MALVOLIO
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out

MALVOLIO
I see you what you are: you are too proud;
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
How does he love me?
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
With adorations, fertile tears,
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him.
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
If I did love you in my master's flame,
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Why, what would you?
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
You might do much.
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Get you to your lord.
VIOLA
1
MALVOLIO
I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse;
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
'What is your parentage?'
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
'What is your parentage?'
    'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
    I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
    Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,
    Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast! Soft, soft!
    Unless the master were the man. How now!
    Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
    Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
    With an invisible and subtle stealth
    To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
    What ho, Malvolio!
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Here, madam, at your service.
OLIVIA
1
MALVOLIO
Run after that same peevish messenger,
MALVOLIO
1
MALVOLIO
Madam, I will.                                  Exit
OLIVIA

MALVOLIO
I do I know not what, and fear to find
ANTONIO

Will you stay no longer; nor will you not that I go with
SEBASTIAN

By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the
ANTONIO

Let me know of you whither you are bound.
SEBASTIAN
0
No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere
ANTONIO

Alas the day!
SEBASTIAN

A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me,
ANTONIO
0
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
SEBASTIAN

O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
ANTONIO
0
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your

If you will not undo what you have done- that is, kill
ANTONIO
0
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
MALVOLIO
0
Were you not ev'n now with the Countess Olivia?
VIOLA
0
Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arriv'd but
MALVOLIO
0
She returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved
VIOLA
0
She took the ring of me; I'll none of it.
MALVOLIO
0
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is
VIOLA
0
I left no ring with her; what means this lady?
SIR TOBY
0
Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is to
AGUECHEEK
0
Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late
SIR TOBY
0
A false conclusion! I hate it as an unfill'd can. To be
AGUECHEEK
0
Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of
SIR TOBY
0
Th'art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
AGUECHEEK

Here comes the fool, i' faith.
CLOWN
0
How now, my hearts! Did you never see the picture of 'we
SIR TOBY

Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.

By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had

Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is
SIR TOBY

Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let's have a song.
AGUECHEEK

There's a testril of me too; if one knight give a-
SIR TOBY

A love-song, a love-song.
AGUECHEEK
0
Ay, ay; I care not for good life.
AGUECHEEK
0
Excellent good, i' faith!
SIR TOBY
0
Good, good!
AGUECHEEK
0
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
SIR TOBY
0
A contagious breath.
AGUECHEEK
0
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
SIR TOBY
0
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall
AGUECHEEK
0
An you love me, let's do't. I am dog at a catch.
CLOWN
0
By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
AGUECHEEK
0
Most certain. Let our catch be 'Thou knave.'
CLOWN
0
'Hold thy peace, thou knave' knight? I shall be constrain'd
AGUECHEEK
0
'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call
CLOWN

I shall never begin if I hold my peace.

Good, i' faith! Come, begin.           [Catch sung]
MARIA

What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not

My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a

MARIA

For the love o' God, peace!
MALVOLIO
0
My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no
SIR TOBY
0
We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
MALVOLIO
0
Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell
SIR TOBY
0
[Sings] Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.
MARIA
0
Nay, good Sir Toby.
CLOWN
0
[Sings] His eyes do show his days are almost done.
MALVOLIO
0
Is't even so?
SIR TOBY
0
[Sings] But I will never die.           [Falls down]
CLOWN

[Sings] Sir Toby, there you lie.
MALVOLIO

This is much credit to you.
SIR TOBY

CLOWN

[Sings] What an if you do?
SIR TOBY
0
[Sings] Shall I bid him go, and spare not?
CLOWN

[Sings] O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.
SIR TOBY

[Rising] Out o' tune, sir! Ye lie. Art any more than a

Yes, by Saint Anne; and ginger shall be hot i' th' mouth

Mistress Mary, if you priz'd my lady's favour at anything
MARIA
0
Go shake your ears.

'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's ahungry,
SIR TOBY
0
Do't, knight. I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll
MARIA
0
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night; since the youth of
SIR TOBY
0
Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
MARIA
0
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.
AGUECHEEK
0
O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog.
SIR TOBY
0
What, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear
AGUECHEEK
0
I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good
MARIA
0
The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a
SIR TOBY
0
What wilt thou do?
MARIA
0
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;
SIR TOBY
0
Excellent! I smell a device.
AGUECHEEK

I have't in my nose too.
SIR TOBY
0
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that
MARIA
0
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
AGUECHEEK
0
And your horse now would make him an ass.
MARIA
0
Ass, I doubt not.
AGUECHEEK
0
O, 'twill be admirable!
MARIA

Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with
SIR TOBY
0
Good night, Penthesilea.
AGUECHEEK
0
Before me, she's a good wench.
SIR TOBY
0
She's a beagle true-bred, and one that adores me.
AGUECHEEK
0
I was ador'd once too.
SIR TOBY
0
Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more
AGUECHEEK
0
If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
SIR TOBY
0
Send for money, knight; if thou hast her not i' th' end,
AGUECHEEK
0
If I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.
SIR TOBY
0
Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late to go
DUKE
0
Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
CURIO

He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing

Who was it?

Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
VIOLA

It gives a very echo to the seat
DUKE

Thou dost speak masterly.
VIOLA

A little, by your favour.
DUKE

What kind of woman is't?
VIOLA
0
Of your complexion.
DUKE

About your years, my lord.

Are you ready, sir?

Ay; prithee, sing.                               [Music]

No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.

I'll pay thy pleasure, then.

Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.

I cannot be so answer'd.

Sooth, but you must.

Ay, but I know-

What dost thou know?

Too well what love women to men may owe.

And what's her history?

A blank, my lord. She never told her love,

I am all the daughters of my father's house,

Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

Nay, I'll come; if I lose a scruple of this sport let me be

Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally

I would exult, man; you know he brought me out o' favour

And then to have the humour of state; and after a demure

O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.

Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for

Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.

And then I comes behind.
FABIAN

Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more

I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of

I could marry this wench for this device.
AGUECHEEK

So could I too.

And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
AGUECHEEK

Nor I neither.
FABIAN

Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
SIR TOBY

Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?

Then westward-ho!
OLIVIA

Stay.
VIOLA

That you do think you are not what you are.

O, ho! do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir
    Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she
    sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she
    incites me to that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says
    she. 'Be opposite with kinsman, surly with servants; let thy
    tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick
    of singularity' and consequently sets down the manner how, as: a
    sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of
    some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim'd her; but it is
    Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away
    now- 'Let this fellow be look'd to.' 'Fellow,' not 'Malvolio' nor
    after my degree, but 'fellow.' Why, everything adheres together,
    that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle,
    no incredulous or unsafe circumstance- What can be said? Nothing
    that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my
    hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be
    thanked.

    will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
    clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of
    mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the
    gentleman- as know his youth will aptly receive it- into a most
    hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This
