FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

ALL
-1
Speak, speak.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?

ALL
-1
Resolv'd, resolv'd.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
    people.

ALL
-1
We know't, we know't.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own
    price. Is't a verdict?

ALL
-1
No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
One word, good citizens.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
    What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield
    us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess
    they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The
    leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
    inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a
    gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
    rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
    thirst for revenge.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Against him first; he's a very dog to the
    commonalty.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Consider you what services he has done for his
    country?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Very well, and could be content to give him good
    report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it
    to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it
    was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be
    partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
What he cannot help in his nature you account a
    vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
    he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts
    within]  What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is
    risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!

ALL
-1
Come, come.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Soft! who comes here?
                       Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd
    the people.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS
-1
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
    With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have
    had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll
    show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;
    they shall know we have strong arms too.

MENENIUS
-1
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
    Will you undo yourselves?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
We cannot, sir; we are undone already.

MENENIUS
-1
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
    Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
    Against the Roman state; whose course will on
    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
    Of more strong link asunder than can ever
    Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
    Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
    You are transported by calamity
    Thither where more attends you; and you slander
    The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,
    When you curse them as enemies.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us
    yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with
    grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily
    any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more
    piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the
    wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear
    us.

MENENIUS
-1
Either you must
    Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
    Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you
    A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
    But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
    To stale't a little more.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to
    fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.

MENENIUS
-1
There was a time when all the body's members
    Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
    That only like a gulf it did remain
    I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,
    Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
    Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments
    Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
    And, mutually participate, did minister
    Unto the appetite and affection common
    Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS
-1
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
    Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-
    For look you, I may make the belly smile
    As well as speak- it tauntingly replied
    To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts
    That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
    As you malign our senators for that
    They are not such as you.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Your belly's answer- What?
    The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
    The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
    Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
    With other muniments and petty helps
    Is this our fabric, if that they-

MENENIUS
-1
What then?
    Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
    Who is the sink o' th' body-

MENENIUS
-1
Well, what then?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
The former agents, if they did complain,
    What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS
-1
I will tell you;
    If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-
    Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Y'are long about it.

MENENIUS
-1
Note me this, good friend:
    Your most grave belly was deliberate,
    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
    'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
    'That I receive the general food at first
    Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
    Because I am the storehouse and the shop
    Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
    I send it through the rivers of your blood,
    Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;
    And, through the cranks and offices of man,
    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
    From me receive that natural competency
    Whereby they live. And though that all at once
    You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS
-1
'Though all at once cannot
    See what I do deliver out to each,
    Yet I can make my audit up, that all
    From me do back receive the flour of all,
    And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
It was an answer. How apply you this?

MENENIUS
-1
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
    And you the mutinous members; for, examine
    Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
    Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find
    No public benefit which you receive
    But it proceeds or comes from them to you,
    And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
    You, the great toe of this assembly?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
I the great toe? Why the great toe?

MENENIUS
-1
For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,
    Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
    Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
    Lead'st first to win some vantage.
    But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.
    Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
    The one side must have bale.
                      Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
    Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS
-1
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues
    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
    Make yourselves scabs?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS
-1
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
    Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
    That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,
    The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
    Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
    Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
    And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
    Deserves your hate; and your affections are
    A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
    Which would increase his evil. He that depends
    Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
    And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
    With every minute you do change a mind
    And call him noble that was now your hate,
    Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter
    That in these several places of the city
    You cry against the noble Senate, who,
    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
    Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS
-1
For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
    The city is well stor'd.

MARCIUS
-1
Hang 'em! They say!
    They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
    What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
    Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out
    Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,
    And feebling such as stand not in their liking
    Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
    Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
    And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
    With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
    As I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS
-1
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
    For though abundantly they lack discretion,
    Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
    What says the other troop?

MARCIUS
-1
They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
    That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
    Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
    They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
    And a petition granted them- a strange one,
    To break the heart of generosity
    And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
    As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,
    Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS
-1
What is granted them?

MARCIUS
-1
Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
    Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-
    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!
    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
    Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
    Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
    For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS
-1
This is strange.

MARCIUS
-1
Go get you home, you fragments.
                     Enter a MESSENGER, hastily

MESSENGER
-1
Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS
-1
Here. What's the matter?

MESSENGER
-1
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS
-1
I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
    Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
         Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with other SENATORS;
                  JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS

FIRST SENATOR
-1
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:
    The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS
-1
They have a leader,
    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
    I sin in envying his nobility;
    And were I anything but what I am,
    I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS
-1
You have fought together?

MARCIUS
-1
Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he
    Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
    Only my wars with him. He is a lion
    That I am proud to hunt.

FIRST SENATOR
-1
Then, worthy Marcius,
    Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS
-1
It is your former promise.

MARCIUS
-1
Sir, it is;
    And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
    Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
    What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?

LARTIUS
-1
No, Caius Marcius;
    I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
    Ere stay behind this business.

MENENIUS
-1
O, true bred!

FIRST SENATOR
-1
Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know,
    Our greatest friends attend us.

LARTIUS
-1
 [To COMINIUS]  Lead you on.
    [To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
    Right worthy you priority.

COMINIUS
-1
Noble Marcius!

FIRST SENATOR
-1
 [To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.

MARCIUS
-1
Nay, let them follow.
    The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither
    To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,
    Your valour puts well forth; pray follow.

SICINIUS
-1
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS
-1
He has no equal.

SICINIUS
-1
When we were chosen tribunes for the people-

BRUTUS
-1
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS
-1
Nay, but his taunts!

BRUTUS
-1
Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS
-1
Bemock the modest moon.

BRUTUS
-1
The present wars devour him! He is grown
    Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS
-1
Such a nature,
    Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
    Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
    His insolence can brook to be commanded
    Under Cominius.

BRUTUS
-1
Fame, at the which he aims-
    In whom already he is well grac'd- cannot
    Better be held nor more attain'd than by
    A place below the first; for what miscarries
    Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
    To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
    Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
    Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS
-1
Besides, if things go well,
    Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
    Of his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS
-1
Come.
    Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
    Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
    To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
    In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS
-1
Let's hence and hear
    How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
    More than his singularity, he goes
    Upon this present action.

BRUTUS
-1
Let's along.                                    Exeunt

FIRST SENATOR

SENATORS
AUFIDIUS
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
    That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
    And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS
1
SENATORS
Is it not yours?
    What ever have been thought on in this state
    That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
    Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
    Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think
    I have the letter here;.yes, here it is:
    [Reads]  'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
    Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;
    The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
    Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
    And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
    These three lead on this preparation
    Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;
    Consider of it.'

FIRST SENATOR
1
SENATORS
AUFIDIUS
Our army's in the field;
    We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
    To answer us.

AUFIDIUS
1
SENATORS
Nor did you think it folly
    To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
    They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
    It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery
    We shall be short'ned in our aim, which was
    To take in many towns ere almost Rome
    Should know we were afoot.

SECOND SENATOR
1
SENATORS
AUFIDIUS
Noble Aufidius,
    Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
    Let us alone to guard Corioli.
    If they set down before's, for the remove
    Bring up your army; but I think you'll find
    Th' have not prepar'd for us.

AUFIDIUS
1
SENATORS
O, doubt not that!
    I speak from certainties. Nay more,
    Some parcels of their power are forth already,
    And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
    If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
    'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
    Till one can do no more.

ALL

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
    comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier
    rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
    embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet
    he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth
    with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
    kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her
    beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person-
    that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if
    renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
    he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
    return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I
    sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than
    now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.

VIRGILIA

MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Then his good report should have been my son; I therein
    would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
    sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
    good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
    than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
                        Enter a GENTLEWOMAN

GENTLEWOMAN

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
VOLUMNIA
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA
2
MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA
2
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Indeed you shall not.
    Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;
    See him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair;
    As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
    Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
    'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,
    Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
    With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
    Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
    Or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA

MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
    Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,
    When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
    Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
    At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria

VIRGILIA

MARCIUS
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS

He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
    And tread upon his neck.
         Enter GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher

VIRGILIA
My ladies both, good day to you.

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Sweet madam!

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are
    you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little
    son?

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS

He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look
    upon his schoolmaster.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very
    pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
    hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run
    after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go
    again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up
    again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how
    'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he
    mammock'd it!

VOLUMNIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
One on's father's moods.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA

MARCIUS
A crack, madam.

VALERIA

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
    idle huswife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA

MARCIUS
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold
    till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you
    must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
    prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
    she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
    Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you
    might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
    of your husband.

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
    last night.

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
    is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
    general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and
    Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they
    nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
    on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA
1
MARCIUS
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
    hereafter.

VOLUMNIA
1
MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease
    our better mirth.

VALERIA

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
    good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
    door and go along with us.

VIRGILIA

MARCIUS
No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much
    mirth.

MARCIUS
VIRGILIA
Well then, farewell.                           Exeunt

MARCIUS

LARTIUS
Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
My horse to yours- no.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
'Tis done.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
Agreed.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
Say, has our general met the enemy?

MESSENGER
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
So, the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
    For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
How far off lie these armies?

MESSENGER
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
    Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
    That we with smoking swords may march from hence
    To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
          They sound a parley. Enter two SENATORS with others,
                      on the walls of Corioli
    Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

FIRST SENATOR
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
    That's lesser than a little.  [Drum afar off]  Hark, our drums
    Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
    Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
    Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
    They'll open of themselves.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!
    There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
    Amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
                   Enter the army of the Volsces

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
    Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
    With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus.
    They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
    Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.
    He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
    And he shall feel mine edge.
          Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.
                      Enter MARCIUS, cursing

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
All the contagion of the south light on you,
    You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues
    Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
    Farther than seen, and one infect another
    Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
    That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
    From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
    All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
    With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
    Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
    And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;
    If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,
    As they us to our trenches. Follow me.
         Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows
                          them to the gates
    So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;
    'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
    Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.
                    [MARCIUS enters the gates]

FIRST SOLDIER

MARCIUS

Fool-hardiness; not I.

SECOND SOLDIER

Not I.                    [MARCIUS is shut in]

FIRST SOLDIER

MARCIUS

See, they have shut him in.

ALL
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
To th' pot, I warrant him.             [Alarum continues]
                      Enter TITUS LARTIUS

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
What is become of Marcius?

ALL
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
Slain, sir, doubtless.

FIRST SOLDIER
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
Following the fliers at the very heels,
    With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
    Clapp'd to their gates. He is himself alone,
    To answer all the city.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
O noble fellow!
    Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
    And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
    A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
    Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
    Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
    Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
    The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
    Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
    Were feverous and did tremble.
          Enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy

FIRST SOLDIER
1
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
Look, sir.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
O, 'tis Marcius!
    Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
                            [They fight, and all enter the city]

FIRST ROMAN
-1
This will I carry to Rome.

SECOND ROMAN
-1
And I this.

THIRD ROMAN
-1
A murrain on 't! I took this for silver.
                               [Alarum continues still afar off]
          Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trumpeter

MARCIUS
-1
See here these movers that do prize their hours
    At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
    Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
    Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
    Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
                                                Exeunt pillagers
    And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
    Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
    Convenient numbers to make good the city;
    Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
    To help Cominius.

LARTIUS
-1
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
    Thy exercise hath been too violent
    For a second course of fight.

MARCIUS
-1
Sir, praise me not;
    My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;
    The blood I drop is rather physical
    Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
    I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS
-1
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
    Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
    Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
    Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS
-1
Thy friend no less
    Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.

LARTIUS
-1
Thy friend no less
    Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.

COMINIUS

Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
    Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
    We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
    By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
    The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
    Lead their successes as we wish our own,
    That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring,
    May give you thankful sacrifice!
                         Enter A MESSENGER
    Thy news?

MESSENGER

COMINIUS
The citizens of Corioli have issued
    And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
    I saw our party to their trenches driven,
    And then I came away.

COMINIUS
0
Though thou speak'st truth,
    Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?

MESSENGER
0
COMINIUS
Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS

'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
    How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
    And bring thy news so late?

MESSENGER
0
COMINIUS
Spies of the Volsces
    Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel
    Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,
    Half an hour since brought my report.
                           Enter MARCIUS

COMINIUS
0
Who's yonder
    That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
    He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
    Before-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS

COMINIUS
Come I too late?

COMINIUS

The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
    More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
    From every meaner man.

MARCIUS

COMINIUS
Come I too late?

COMINIUS
0
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
    But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS

COMINIUS
O! let me clip ye
    In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
    As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
    And tapers burn'd to bedward.

COMINIUS
0
Flower of warriors,
    How is't with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS
0
COMINIUS
As with a man busied about decrees:
    Condemning some to death and some to exile;
    Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
    To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS
0
Where is that slave
    Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
    Where is he? Call him hither.

MARCIUS
0
COMINIUS
Let him alone;
    He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
    The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!
    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
    From rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS
0
But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS
0
COMINIUS
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
    Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
    If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS
0
Marcius,
    We have at disadvantage fought, and did
    Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS
0
COMINIUS
How lies their battle? Know you on which side
    They have plac'd their men of trust?

COMINIUS
0
As I guess, Marcius,
    Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
    Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
    Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS
0
COMINIUS
I do beseech you,
    By all the battles wherein we have fought,
    By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows
    We have made to endure friends, that you directly
    Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
    And that you not delay the present, but,
    Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,
    We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS
0
Though I could wish
    You were conducted to a gentle bath
    And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
    Deny your asking: take your choice of those
    That best can aid your action.

MARCIUS
0
COMINIUS
Those are they
    That most are willing. If any such be here-
    As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting
    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
    Lesser his person than an ill report;
    If any think brave death outweighs bad life
    And that his country's dearer than himself;
    Let him alone, or so many so minded,
    Wave thus to express his disposition,
    And follow Marcius.           [They all shout and wave their
       swords, take him up in their arms and cast up their caps]
    O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
    If these shows be not outward, which of you
    But is four Volsces? None of you but is
    Able to bear against the great Aufidius
    A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
    Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest
    Shall bear the business in some other fight,
    As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
    And four shall quickly draw out my command,
    Which men are best inclin'd.

COMINIUS

March on, my fellows;
    Make good this ostentation, and you shall
    Divide in all with us.                                Exeunt

LARTIUS
-1
So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
    As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
    Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
    For a short holding. If we lose the field
    We cannot keep the town.

LIEUTENANT

Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS

MARCIUS
AUFIDIUS
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
    Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.       Exeunt

MARCIUS
1
AUFIDIUS
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
    Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
We hate alike:
    Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
    More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS

AUFIDIUS
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
    And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
If I fly, Marcius,
    Halloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS
1
AUFIDIUS
Within these three hours, Tullus,
    Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
    And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
    Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy revenge
    Wrench up thy power to th' highest.

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
Wert thou the Hector
    That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
    Thou shouldst not scape me here.
       Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid
        of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
                             breathless
    Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me
    In your condemned seconds.                            Exeunt

COMINIUS
-1
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
    Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it
    Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
    Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
    I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
    And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
    That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
    Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
    Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
    Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast,
    Having fully din'd before.
         Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit

LARTIUS
-1
O General,
    Here is the steed, we the caparison.
    Hadst thou beheld-

MARCIUS
-1
Pray now, no more; my mother,
    Who has a charter to extol her blood,
    When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
    As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd
    As you have been- that's for my country.
    He that has but effected his good will
    Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS
-1
You shall not be
    The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
    The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment
    Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
    To hide your doings and to silence that
    Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
    Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,
    In sign of what you are, not to reward
    What you have done, before our army hear me.

MARCIUS
-1
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
    To hear themselves rememb'red.

COMINIUS
-1
Should they not,
    Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
    And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
    The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
    We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth
    Before the common distribution at
    Your only choice.

MARCIUS
-1
I thank you, General,
    But cannot make my heart consent to take
    A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
    And stand upon my common part with those
    That have beheld the doing.
           A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
    May these same instruments which you profane
    Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
    I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
    Made all of false-fac'd soothing. When steel grows
    Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made
    An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
    For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,
    Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note
    Here's many else have done, you shout me forth
    In acclamations hyperbolical,
    As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
    In praises sauc'd with lies.

COMINIUS
-1
Too modest are you;
    More cruel to your good report than grateful
    To us that give you truly. By your patience,
    If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
    Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles,
    Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
    As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
    Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,
    My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
    With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
    For what he did before Corioli, can him
    With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,
    Caius Marcius Coriolanus.
    Bear th' addition nobly ever!
                           [Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums]

ALL
-1
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS
-1
I will go wash;
    And when my face is fair you shall perceive
    Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you;
    I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
    To undercrest your good addition
    To th' fairness of my power.

COMINIUS
-1
So, to our tent;
    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
    To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
    Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome
    The best, with whom we may articulate
    For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS
-1
I shall, my lord.

CORIOLANUS
-1
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
    Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg
    Of my Lord General.

COMINIUS
-1
Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?

CORIOLANUS
-1
I sometime lay here in Corioli
    At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.
    He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
    But then Aufidius was within my view,
    And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
    To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS
-1
O, well begg'd!
    Were he the butcher of my son, he should
    Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS
-1
Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS
-1
By Jupiter, forgot!
    I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
    Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS
-1
Go we to our tent.
    The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
    It should be look'd to. Come.                         Exeunt

Condition!
    I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
    Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
    What good condition can a treaty find
    I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
    I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
    As often as we eat. By th' elements,
    If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
    He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation
    Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
    I thought to crush him in an equal force,
    True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
    Or wrath or craft may get him.

Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd

    Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
    Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
    The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
    Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
    Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
    My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
    At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
    Against the hospitable canon, would I
    Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;

Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love

He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not

Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
    occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your
    dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the
    least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame
    Marcius for being proud?

We do it not alone, sir.

2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are
    many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your
    abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of
    pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
    necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
    that you could!

BOTH TRIBUNES
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What then, sir?

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
    proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves
    a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
    be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
    and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
    with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
    morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
    Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you
    Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I
    make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have
    deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with
    the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to
    bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie
    deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the
    map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too?
    What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
    character, if I be known well enough too?

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are
    ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good
    wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and
    a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
    to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter
    between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the
    colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag
    against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss
    the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All
    the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
    knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
    for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
    encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak
    best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your
    beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
    stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
    pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a
    cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;
    though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
    hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation
    would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
    plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.
                                  [BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]
               Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
    How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon, were she
    earthly, no nobler- whither do you follow your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the
    love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Ha! Marcius coming home?

VOLUMNIA

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous
    approbation.

MENENIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
    Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Look, here's a letter from him; the state hath another,
    his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?

VIRGILIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'
    health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The
    most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to
    this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
    not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
O, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a victory in
    his pocket? The wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with
    the oaken garland.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius
    got off.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he
    had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the
    chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate
    possess'd of this?

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has
    letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name
    of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former deeds
    doubly.

VALERIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true
    purchasing.

VIRGILIA

The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
True! pow, waw.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
True! I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?
    [To the TRIBUNES]  God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
    home; he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there will be large
    cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
    He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I
    know.

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds
    upon him.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave.
    [A shout and flourish]  Hark! the trumpets.

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries
      noise, and behind him he leaves tears;
    Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie,
    Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.
            A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
              GENERAL, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them,

    Within Corioli gates, where he hath won,

Nay, my good soldier, up;
    My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and

Now the gods crown thee!

    O, welcome home! And welcome, General.
    And y'are welcome all.

MENENIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
    And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!
    A curse begin at very root on's heart
    That is not glad to see thee! You are three
    That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,
    We have some old crab trees here at home that will not
    Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.
    We call a nettle but a nettle, and
    The faults of fools but folly.

 [To his wife and mother]  Your hand, and yours.
    Ere in our own house I do shade my head,

    But with them change of honours.

VOLUMNIA

    There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
    Our Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Know, good mother,
    I had rather be their servant in my way
    Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS

MENENIUS

SICINIUS
On, to the Capitol.
                 [Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before]
                BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
    Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
    Into a rapture lets her baby cry
    While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
    Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
    Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,
    Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
    With variable complexions, all agreeing
    In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
    Do press among the popular throngs and puff
    To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames
    Commit the war of white and damask in
    Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
    Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
    As if that whatsoever god who leads him
    Were slily crept into his human powers,
    And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
On the sudden
    I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Then our office may
    During his power go sleep.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
    From where he should begin and end, but will
    Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Doubt not
    The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
    Upon their ancient malice will forget
    With the least cause these his new honours; which
    That he will give them make I as little question
    As he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
I heard him swear,
    Were he to stand for consul, never would he
    Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put
    The napless vesture of humility;
    Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
    To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
'Tis right.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
    Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
    And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
I wish no better
    Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
    In execution.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
'Tis most like he will.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
It shall be to him then as our good wills:
    A sure destruction.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
So it must fall out
    To him or our authorities. For an end,
    We must suggest the people in what hatred
    He still hath held them; that to's power he would
    Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
    Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
    In human action and capacity
    Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
    Than camels in their war, who have their provand
    Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
    For sinking under them.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
This, as you say, suggested
    At some time when his soaring insolence
    Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
    If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
    As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
    To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
    Shall darken him for ever.

What's the matter?

MESSENGER
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
    That Marcius shall be consul.
    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
    The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
    Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
    Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
    As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
    A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
    I never saw the like.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Let's to the Capitol,
    And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
    But hearts for the event.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Have with you.                                Exeunt

FIRST OFFICER
-1
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for
    consulships?

SECOND OFFICER
-1
Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one
    Coriolanus will carry it.

FIRST OFFICER
-1
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and
    loves not the common people.

SECOND OFFICER
-1
Faith, there have been many great men that have
    flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many
    that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they
    love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.
    Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
    hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
    disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
    see't.

FIRST OFFICER
-1
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
    he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;
    but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
    render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
    him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and
    displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to
    flatter them for their love.

SECOND OFFICER
-1
He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his
    ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been
    supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further
    deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but
    he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
    their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
    so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise
    were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof
    and rebuke from every car that heard it.

FIRST OFFICER
-1
No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they
    are coming.
         A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
         OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS before them; CORIOLANUS,
            MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul. SICINIUS and
               BRUTUS take their places by themselves.
                         CORIOLANUS stands

MENENIUS
-1
Having determin'd of the Volsces, and
    To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
    As the main point of this our after-meeting,
    To gratify his noble service that
    Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,
    Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
    The present consul and last general
    In our well-found successes to report
    A little of that worthy work perform'd
    By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom
    We met here both to thank and to remember
    With honours like himself.                 [CORIOLANUS sits]

FIRST SENATOR
-1
Speak, good Cominius.
    Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
    Rather our state's defective for requital
    Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people,
    We do request your kindest ears; and, after,
    Your loving motion toward the common body,
    To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS
-1
We are convented
    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
    Inclinable to honour and advance
    The theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS
-1
Which the rather
    We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember
    A kinder value of the people than
    He hath hereto priz'd them at.

MENENIUS
-1
That's off, that's off;
    I would you rather had been silent. Please you
    To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS
-1
Most willingly.
    But yet my caution was more pertinent
    Than the rebuke you give it.

MENENIUS
-1
He loves your people;
    But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
    Worthy Cominius, speak.
                       [CORIOLANUS rises, and offers to go away]
    Nay, keep your place.

FIRST SENATOR
-1
Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear
    What you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Your Honours' pardon.
    I had rather have my wounds to heal again
    Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS
-1
Sir, I hope
    My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS
-1
No, sir; yet oft,
    When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
    You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people,
    I love them as they weigh-

MENENIUS
-1
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS
-1
I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun
    When the alarum were struck than idly sit
    To hear my nothings monster'd.                          Exit

MENENIUS
-1
Masters of the people,
    Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-
    That's thousand to one good one- when you now see
    He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
    Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS
-1
I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus
    Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
    That valour is the chiefest virtue and
    Most dignifies the haver. If it be,
    The man I speak of cannot in the world
    Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,
    When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
    Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,
    Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight
    When with his Amazonian chin he drove
    The bristled lips before him; he bestrid
    An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
    Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,
    And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
    When he might act the woman in the scene,
    He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed
    Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
    Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,
    And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
    He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
    Before and in Corioli, let me say
    I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,
    And by his rare example made the coward
    Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
    And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
    Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red
    The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted
    With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
    And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
    Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.
    When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
    His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
    Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,
    And to the battle came he; where he did
    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
    'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd
    Both field and city ours he never stood
    To ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS
-1
Worthy man!

FIRST SENATOR
-1
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
    Which we devise him.

COMINIUS
-1
Our spoils he kick'd at,
    And look'd upon things precious as they were
    The common muck of the world. He covets less
    Than misery itself would give, rewards
    His deeds with doing them, and is content
    To spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS
-1
He's right noble;
    Let him be call'd for.

FIRST SENATOR
-1
Call Coriolanus.
    OFFICER. He doth appear.
                            Enter CORIOLANUS

MENENIUS
-1
The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
    To make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS
-1
I do owe them still
    My life and services.

MENENIUS
-1
It then remains
    That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS
-1
I do beseech you
    Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot
    Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them
    For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you
    That I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS
-1
Sir, the people
    Must have their voices; neither will they bate
    One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS
-1
Put them not to't.
    Pray you go fit you to the custom, and
    Take to you, as your predecessors have,
    Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS
-1
It is a part
    That I shall blush in acting, and might well
    Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS
-1
Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS
-1
To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'
    Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,
    As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
    Of their breath only!

MENENIUS
-1
Do not stand upon't.
    We recommend to you, Tribunes of the People,
    Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul
    Wish we all joy and honour.

SENATORS
-1
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
                             [Flourish. Cornets. Then exeunt all
                                        but SICINIUS and BRUTUS]

BRUTUS
-1
You see how he intends to use the people.

SICINIUS
-1
May they perceive's intent! He will require them
    As if he did contemn what he requested
    Should be in them to give.

BRUTUS
-1
Come, we'll inform them
    Of our proceedings here. On th' market-place
    I know they do attend us.                             Exeunt

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to
    deny him.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
We may, sir, if we will.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
    power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds
    and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those
    wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we
    must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
    monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
    monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should
    bring ourselves to be monstrous members.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
    will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
    not to call us the many-headed multitude.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads
    are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our
    wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits
    were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north,
    south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
    all the points o' th' compass.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
    fly?

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
    will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
    liberty 'twould sure southward.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Why that way?

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts
    conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you
    may.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's
    no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would
    incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.
                Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility,
                               with MENENIUS
    Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.
    We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he
    stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his
    requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
    honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues;
    therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him.

ALL
-1
Content, content.                         Exeunt citizens

MENENIUS
-1
O sir, you are not right; have you not known
    The worthiest men have done't?

CORIOLANUS
-1
What must I say?
    'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I cannot bring
    My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds
    I got them in my country's service, when
    Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
    From th' noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS
-1
O me, the gods!
    You must not speak of that. You must desire them
    To think upon you.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Think upon me? Hang 'em!
    I would they would forget me, like the virtues
    Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS
-1
You'll mar all.
    I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,
    In wholesome manner.                                    Exit
                       Enter three of the citizens

CORIOLANUS
-1
Bid them wash their faces
    And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.
    You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Mine own desert.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Your own desert?

CORIOLANUS
-1
Ay, not mine own desire.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
How, not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS
-1
No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
    with begging.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to
    gain by you.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show
    you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what
    say you?

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS
-1
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.
    I have your alms. Adieu.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
But this is something odd.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.
                                       Exeunt the three citizens
                      Enter two other citizens

CORIOLANUS
-1
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
    voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.

FOURTH CITIZEN
-1
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
    have not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Your enigma?

FOURTH CITIZEN
-1
You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have
    been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common
    people.

CORIOLANUS
-1
You should account me the more virtuous, that I have
    not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn
    brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
    condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their
    choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
    the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That
    is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
    and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I
    may be consul.

FIFTH CITIZEN
-1
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
    you our voices heartily.

FOURTH CITIZEN
-1
You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS
-1
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
    will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.

BOTH CITIZENS
-1
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
                                                 Exeunt citizens

CORIOLANUS
-1
Most sweet voices!
    Better it is to die, better to starve,
    Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
    Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
    To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
    Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
    What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
    The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
    And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
    For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
    Let the high office and the honour go
    To one that would do thus. I am half through:
    The one part suffered, the other will I do.
                      Enter three citizens more
    Here come moe voices.
    Your voices. For your voices I have fought;
    Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
    Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
    I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
    Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices?
    Indeed, I would be consul.

SIXTH CITIZEN
-1
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
    man's voice.

SEVENTH CITIZEN
-1
Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him
    joy, and make him good friend to the people!

ALL
-1
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
                                                 Exeunt citizens

CORIOLANUS
-1
Worthy voices!
             Enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

MENENIUS
-1
You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
    Endue you with the people's voice. Remains
    That, in th' official marks invested, you
    Anon do meet the Senate.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Is this done?

SICINIUS
-1
The custom of request you have discharg'd.
    The people do admit you, and are summon'd
    To meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Where? At the Senate House?

SICINIUS
-1
There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS
-1
May I change these garments?

SICINIUS
-1
You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS
-1
That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
    Repair to th' Senate House.

MENENIUS
-1
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS
-1
We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS
-1
Fare you well.

BRUTUS
-1
With a proud heart he wore
    His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?
                            Enter citizens

SICINIUS
-1
How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS
-1
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
    He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
Certainly;
    He flouted us downright.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.

SECOND CITIZEN
-1
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
    He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us
    His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.

SICINIUS
-1
Why, so he did, I am sure.

ALL
-1
No, no; no man saw 'em.

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
He said he had wounds which he could show in
      private,
    And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
    'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom
    But by your voices will not so permit me;
    Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
    Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you,
    Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,
    I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS
-1
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
    Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
    To yield your voices?

BRUTUS
-1
Could you not have told him-
    As you were lesson'd- when he had no power
    But was a petty servant to the state,
    He was your enemy; ever spake against
    Your liberties and the charters that you bear
    I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
    A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
    If he should still malignantly remain
    Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might
    Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
    That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
    Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
    Would think upon you for your voices, and
    Translate his malice towards you into love,
    Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS
-1
Thus to have said,
    As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
    And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
    Either his gracious promise, which you might,
    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
    Which easily endures not article
    Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
    You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
    And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS
-1
Did you perceive
    He did solicit you in free contempt
    When he did need your loves; and do you think
    That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
    When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
    No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
    Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS
-1
Have you
    Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
    Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
    Your su'd-for tongues?

THIRD CITIZEN
-1
He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.

SECOND CITIZENS
-1
And will deny him;
    I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

FIRST CITIZEN
-1
I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece
    'em.

BRUTUS
-1
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
    They have chose a consul that will from them take
    Their liberties, make them of no more voice
    Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
    As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS
-1
Let them assemble;
    And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
    Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
    And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
    With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
    How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
    Thinking upon his services, took from you
    Th' apprehension of his present portance,
    Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
    After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS
-1
Lay
    A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
    No impediment between, but that you must
    Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS
-1
Say you chose him
    More after our commandment than as guided
    By your own true affections; and that your minds,
    Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
    Than what you should, made you against the grain
    To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS
-1
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
    How youngly he began to serve his country,
    How long continued; and what stock he springs of-
    The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came
    That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
    Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
    Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
    That our best water brought by conduits hither;
    And Censorinus, nobly named so,
    Twice being by the people chosen censor,
    Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS
-1
One thus descended,
    That hath beside well in his person wrought
    To be set high in place, we did commend
    To your remembrances; but you have found,
    Scaling his present bearing with his past,
    That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
    Your sudden approbation.

BRUTUS
-1
Say you ne'er had done't-
    Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
    And presently, when you have drawn your number,
    Repair to th' Capitol.

CITIZENS
-1
will will so; almost all
    Repent in their election.                   Exeunt plebeians

BRUTUS
-1
Let them go on;
    This mutiny were better put in hazard
    Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
    If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
    With their refusal, both observe and answer
    The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
To th' Capitol, come.
    We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
    And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
    Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?

LARTIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
    Our swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
    Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
    Upon's again.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
They are worn, Lord Consul, so
    That we shall hardly in our ages see
    Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
    Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
    Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
How? What?

LARTIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
    That of all things upon the earth he hated
    Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
    To hopeless restitution, so he might
    Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
    To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
                       Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
    Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
    The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,
    For they do prank them in authority,
    Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Ha! What is that?

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
It will be dangerous to go on- no further.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
What makes this change?

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
The matter?

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Have I had children's voices?

FIRST SENATOR
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
The people are incens'd against him.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Stop,
    Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Are these your herd?
    Must these have voices, that can yield them now
    And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
    You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
    Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
    To curb the will of the nobility;
    Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
    Nor ever will be rul'd.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Call't not a plot.
    The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,
    When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
    Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
    Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
How? I inform them!

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Not unlike
    Each way to better yours.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
    Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
    Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
You show too much of that
    For which the people stir; if you will pass
    To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
    Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
    Or never be so noble as a consul,
    Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
    Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
    Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
    I' th' plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Tell me of corn!
    This was my speech, and I will speak't again-

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Not now, not now.

FIRST SENATOR
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Now, as I live, I will.
    My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
    For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
    Regard me as I do not flatter, and
    Therein behold themselves. I say again,
    In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
    Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
    By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
    Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
    Which they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Well, no more.

FIRST SENATOR
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
How? no more!
    As for my country I have shed my blood,
    Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
    Coin words till their decay against those measles
    Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
    The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
You speak o' th' people
    As if you were a god, to punish; not
    A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
'Twere well
    We let the people know't.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Choler!
    Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
    By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
It is a mind
    That shall remain a poison where it is,
    Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Shall remain!
    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
    His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
'Shall'!
    O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
    You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
    Given Hydra here to choose an officer
    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
    The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit
    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
    And make your channel his? If he have power,
    Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
    Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
    Be not as common fools; if you are not,
    Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
    If they be senators; and they are no less,
    When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
    Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;
    And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
    His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
    Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
    It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
    To know, when two authorities are up,
    Neither supreme, how soon confusion
    May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
    The one by th' other.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
Well, on to th' market-place.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
    The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd
    Sometime in Greece-

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Well, well, no more of that.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
    I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed
    The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Why shall the people give
    One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
I'll give my reasons,
    More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
    Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
    They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war
    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
    They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
    Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,
    Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
    Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation
    Which they have often made against the Senate,
    All cause unborn, could never be the native
    Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
    How shall this bosom multiplied digest
    The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
    What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
    We are the greater poll, and in true fear
    They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
    The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
    Call our cares fears; which will in time
    Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in
    The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Come, enough.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Enough, with over measure.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
No, take more.
    What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
    Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
    Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
    Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
    Of general ignorance- it must omit
    Real necessities, and give way the while
    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows
    Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you-
    You that will be less fearful than discreet;
    That love the fundamental part of state
    More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer
    A noble life before a long, and wish
    To jump a body with a dangerous physic
    That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out
    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
    The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
    Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
    Of that integrity which should become't,
    Not having the power to do the good it would,
    For th' ill which doth control't.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Has said enough.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
    As traitors do.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
    What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
    On whom depending, their obedience fails
    To the greater bench? In a rebellion,
    When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
    Then were they chosen; in a better hour
    Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
    And throw their power i' th' dust.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
This a consul? No.

Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
    Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS

CORIOLANUS
Help, ye citizens!
              Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES

MENENIUS

COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS

COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS

    Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
    Whom late you have nam'd for consul.

Fie, fie, fie!
    This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
What is the city but the people?

PLEBEIANS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
True,
    The people are the city.

BRUTUS

By the consent of all we were establish'd
    The people's magistrates.

PLEBEIANS
2
MENENIUS

CORIOLANUS
You so remain.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
And so are like to do.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
That is the way to lay the city flat,
    To bring the roof to the foundation,
    And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
    In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
This deserves death.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Or let us stand to our authority
    Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
    Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power
    We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy
    Of present death.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Therefore lay hold of him;
    Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
    Into destruction cast him.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
AEdiles, seize him.

PLEBEIANS

Peace, peace!

MENENIUS

Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,
    And temp'rately proceed to what you would
    Thus violently redress.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Sir, those cold ways,
    That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
    Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him
    And bear him to the rock.
                                    [CORIOLANUS draws his sword]

CORIOLANUS

No: I'll die here.
    There's some among you have beheld me fighting;
    Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS

Shall it be put to that?

FIRST SENATOR

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
The gods forbid!
    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
    Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS

COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
For 'tis a sore upon us
    You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
I would they were barbarians, as they are,
    Though in Rome litter'd; not Romans, as they are not,
    Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Be gone.
    Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
    One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
On fair ground
    I could beat forty of them.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
I could myself
    Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
CORIOLANUS
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
    And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
    Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
    Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
    Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear
    What they are us'd to bear.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
CORIOLANUS
Pray you be gone.
    I'll try whether my old wit be in request
    With those that have but little; this must be patch'd
    With cloth of any colour.

His nature is too noble for the world:
    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
    Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;
    What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
    And, being angry, does forget that ever
    He heard the name of death.                 [A noise within]

Where is this viper
    That would depopulate the city and
    Be every man himself?

MENENIUS

You worthy Tribunes-

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock

The consul Coriolanus.

No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS

If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
    I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
    The which shall turn you to no further harm
    Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS
0
MENENIUS
Speak briefly, then,
    For we are peremptory to dispatch
    This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
    Were but one danger, and to keep him here
    Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
    He dies to-night.

MENENIUS
0
Now the good gods forbid
    That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
    Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
    In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
    Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS
0
MENENIUS
He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS
0
O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
    Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.
    What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
    Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-
    Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
    By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;
    And what is left, to lose it by his country
    Were to us all that do't and suffer it
    A brand to th' end o' th' world.

SICINIUS
0
MENENIUS
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS

MENENIUS
Merely awry. When he did love his country,
    It honour'd him.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
The service of the foot,
    Being once gangren'd, is not then respected
    For what before it was.

BRUTUS

We'll hear no more.
    Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
    Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
    Spread further.

MENENIUS

One word more, one word
    This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
    The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
    Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,
    Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,
    And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS

MENENIUS
If it were so-

SICINIUS

What do ye talk?
    Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
    Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!

MENENIUS

Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
    Since 'a could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
    In bolted language; meal and bran together
    He throws without distinction. Give me leave,

    Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
    In peace, to his utmost peril.

If it be honour in your wars to seem
    The same you are not, which for your best ends

    That it shall hold companionship in peace
    With honour as in war; since that to both
    It stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS
0
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA
0
CORIOLANUS
Because that now it lies you on to speak
    To th' people, not by your own instruction,
    Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you,
    But with such words that are but roted in
    Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
    Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
    Now, this no more dishonours you at all
    Than to take in a town with gentle words,
    Which else would put you to your fortune and
    The hazard of much blood.
    I would dissemble with my nature where
    My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
    I should do so in honour. I am in this
    Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;

    Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
    More learned than the ears- waving thy head,
    Which often thus correcting thy-stout heart,
    Now humble as the ripest mulberry

    Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,
    Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
    Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,

                 Enter the first SERVINGMAN

FIRST SERVANT
-1
What would you have, friend?
    Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door.

CORIOLANUS
-1
I have deserv'd no better entertainment
    In being Coriolanus.
                   Enter second SERVINGMAN

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
    head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Away!

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Away? Get you away.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Now th' art troublesome.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Are you so brave? I'll have you talk'd with anon.
          Enter a third SERVINGMAN. The first meets him

THIRD SERVANT
-1
What fellow's this?

FIRST SERVANT
-1
A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him
    out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you avoid the
    house.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Let me but stand- I will not hurt your hearth.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
What are you?

CORIOLANUS
-1
A gentleman.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
A marv'llous poor one.

CORIOLANUS
-1
True, so I am.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
    station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid. Come.

CORIOLANUS
-1
Follow your function, go and batten on cold bits.
                                      [Pushes him away from him]

THIRD SERVANT
-1
What, you will not? Prithee tell my master what a
    strange guest he has here.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
And I shall.                              Exit

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Where dwell'st thou?

CORIOLANUS
-1
Under the canopy.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Under the canopy?

CORIOLANUS
-1
Ay.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS
-1
I' th' city of kites and crows.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
I' th' city of kites and crows!
    What an ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too?

CORIOLANUS
-1
No, I serve not thy master.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS
-1
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
    mistress. Thou prat'st and prat'st; serve with thy trencher;
    hence!                                      [Beats him away]
             Enter AUFIDIUS with the second SERVINGMAN

AUFIDIUS
-1
Where is this fellow?

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for
    disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS
-1
Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?
    Why speak'st not? Speak, man. What's thy name?

CORIOLANUS
-1
 [Unmuffling]  If, Tullus,
    Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not
    Think me for the man I am, necessity
    Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS
-1
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS
-1
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
    And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS
-1
Say, what's thy name?
    Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face
    Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn,
    Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?

CORIOLANUS
-1
Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS
-1
I know thee not. Thy name?

CORIOLANUS
-1
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
    To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
    Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
    My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,
    The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
    Shed for my thankless country, are requited
    But with that surname- a good memory
    And witness of the malice and displeasure
    Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;
    The cruelty and envy of the people,
    Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
    Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,
    An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
    Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
    Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
    Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
    I had fear'd death, of all the men i' th' world
    I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
    To be full quit of those my banishers,
    Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
    A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
    Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
    Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight
    And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
    That my revengeful services may prove
    As benefits to thee; for I will fight
    Against my cank'red country with the spleen
    Of all the under fiends. But if so be
    Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
    Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
    Longer to live most weary, and present
    My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
    Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
    Since I have ever followed thee with hate,
    Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
    And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
    It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS
-1
O Marcius, Marcius!
    Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
    A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
    Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
    And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
    Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
    Mine arms about that body, where against
    My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
    And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
    The anvil of my sword, and do contest
    As hotly and as nobly with thy love
    As ever in ambitious strength I did
    Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
    I lov'd the maid I married; never man
    Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
    Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart
    Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
    Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell the
    We have a power on foot, and I had purpose
    Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
    Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out
    Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
    Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me-
    We have been down together in my sleep,
    Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat-
    And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
    Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
    Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
    From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
    Like a bold flood o'erbeat. O, come, go in,
    And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
    Who now are here, taking their leaves of me
    Who am prepar'd against your territories,
    Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS
-1
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS
-1
Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have
    The leading of thine own revenges, take
    Th' one half of my commission, and set down-
    As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st
    Thy country's strength and weakness- thine own ways,
    Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
    Or rudely visit them in parts remote
    To fright them ere destroy. But come in;
    Let me commend thee first to those that shall
    Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
    And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
    Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand; most welcome!

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Here's a strange alteration!

SECOND SERVANT
-1
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
    of him.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his
    finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
    him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to
    term it.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,
    but I thought there was more in him than I could think.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest
    man i' th' world.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot
    on.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Who, my master?

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Nay, it's no matter for that.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Worth six on him.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the
    greater soldier.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that;
    for the defence of a town our general is excellent.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Ay, and for an assault too.
                       Enter the third SERVINGMAN

THIRD SERVANT
-1
O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals!

BOTH
-1
What, what, what? Let's partake.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
I would not be a Roman, of all nations;
    I had as lief be a condemn'd man.

BOTH
-1
Wherefore? wherefore?

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general-
    Caius Marcius.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Why do you say 'thwack our general'?

THIRD SERVANT
-1
I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always
    good enough for him.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too
    hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
    on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
    carbonado.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
    broil'd and eaten him too.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
But more of thy news!

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son
    and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question
    asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him.
    Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself
    with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse.
    But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle
    and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half
    by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
    and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all
    down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
    many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst
    not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,
    whilst he's in directitude.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Directitude? What's that?

THIRD SERVANT
-1
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and
    the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies
    after rain, and revel an with him.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
But when goes this forward?

THIRD SERVANT
-1
To-morrow, to-day, presently. You shall have the
    drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their
    feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
    This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and
    breed ballad-makers.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
    day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.
    Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy,
    insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a
    destroyer of men.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be
    a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
    cuckolds.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

THIRD SERVANT
-1
Reason: because they then less need one another. The
    wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.
    They are rising, they are rising.

BOTH
-1
In, in, in, in!                                   Exeunt

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.
    His remedies are tame. The present peace
    And quietness of the people, which before
    Were in wild hurry, here do make his friends
    Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,
    Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
    Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see
    Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
    About their functions friendly.
                          Enter MENENIUS

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind
    Of late. Hail, sir!

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Hail to you both!

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd
    But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,
    And so would do, were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
All's well, and might have been much better
    He could have temporiz'd.

SICINIUS

Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS

SICINIUS
Nay, I hear nothing; his mother and his wife
    Hear nothing from him.

This is a happier and more comely time
    Than when these fellows ran about the streets
    Crying confusion.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Caius Marcius was
    A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
    Self-loving-

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
And affecting one sole throne,
    Without assistance.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I think not so.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
    If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
    Sits safe and still without him.
                             Enter an AEDILE

AEDILE
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Worthy tribunes,
    There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
    Reports the Volsces with several powers
    Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
    And with the deepest malice of the war
    Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
'Tis Aufidius,
    Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
    Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,
    Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
    And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Come, what talk you of Marcius?

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
    The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Cannot be!
    We have record that very well it can;
    And three examples of the like hath been
    Within my age. But reason with the fellow
    Before you punish him, where he heard this,
    Lest you shall chance to whip your information
    And beat the messenger who bids beware
    Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Tell not me.
    I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Not Possible.

MESSENGER
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
The nobles in great earnestness are going
    All to the Senate House; some news is come
    That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
'Tis this slave-
    Go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising,
    Nothing but his report.

MESSENGER
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Yes, worthy sir,
    The slave's report is seconded, and more,
    More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
What more fearful?

MESSENGER
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
It is spoke freely out of many mouths-
    How probable I do not know- that Marcius,
    Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
    And vows revenge as spacious as between
    The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
This is most likely!

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
    Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
The very trick on 't.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
This is unlikely.
    He and Aufidius can no more atone
    Than violent'st contrariety.
                      Enter a second MESSENGER

SECOND MESSENGER
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You are sent for to the Senate.
    A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
    Associated with Aufidius, rages
    Upon our territories, and have already
    O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took
    What lay before them.
                            Enter COMINIUS

SICINIUS
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What news? what news?

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
    To melt the city leads upon your pates,
    To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses-

MENENIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What's the news? What's the news?

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Your temples burned in their cement, and
    Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd
    Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Pray now, your news?
    You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news.
    If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians-

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
If!
    He is their god; he leads them like a thing
    Made by some other deity than Nature,
    That shapes man better; and they follow him
    Against us brats with no less confidence
    Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
    Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You have made good work,
    You and your apron men; you that stood so much
    Upon the voice of occupation and
    The breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
He'll shake
    Your Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS

SICINIUS
As Hercules
    Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work!

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Ay; and you'll look pale
    Before you find it other. All the regions
    Do smilingly revolt, and who resists
    Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
    And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
    Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
We are all undone unless
    The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Who shall ask it?
    The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
    Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
    Does of the shepherds; for his best friends, if they
    Should say 'Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even
    As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,
    And therein show'd fike enemies.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
'Tis true;
    If he were putting to my house the brand
    That should consume it, I have not the face
    To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
    You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You have brought
    A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
    S' incapable of help.

BOTH TRIBUNES

SICINIUS
Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts
    And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
    Who did hoot him out o' th' city.

COMINIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
But I fear
    They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
    The second name of men, obeys his points
    As if he were his officer. Desperation
    Is all the policy, strength, and defence,
    That Rome can make against them.
                       Enter a troop of citizens

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Here comes the clusters.
    And is Aufidius with him? You are they
    That made the air unwholesome when you cast
    Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
    Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,
    And not a hair upon a soldier's head
    Which will not prove a whip; as many coxcombs
    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
    And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
    If he could burn us all into one coal
    We have deserv'd it.

THIRD CITIZEN

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
    many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we
    willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our
    will.

Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;

    And show no sign of fear.

    Would buy this for a lie!

BRUTUS
Pray let's go.                                Exeunt

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
Do they still fly to th' Roman?

LIEUTENANT
1
AUFIDIUS
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
    Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,
    Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
    And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
    Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
I cannot help it now,
    Unless by using means I lame the foot
    Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
    Even to my person, than I thought he would
    When first I did embrace him; yet his nature
    In that's no changeling, and I must excuse
    What cannot be amended.

LIEUTENANT
1
AUFIDIUS
Yet I wish, sir-
    I mean, for your particular- you had not
    Join'd in commission with him, but either
    Had borne the action of yourself, or else
    To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
    When he shall come to his account, he knows not
    What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
    And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
    To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly
    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
    As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
    That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
    Whene'er we come to our account.

LIEUTENANT
1
AUFIDIUS
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
All places yield to him ere he sits down,
    And the nobility of Rome are his;
    The senators and patricians love him too.
    The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
    Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
    To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
    By sovereignty of nature. First he was
    A noble servant to them, but he could not
    Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,
    Which out of daily fortune ever taints
    The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
    To fail in the disposing of those chances
    Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
    Not to be other than one thing, not moving
    From th' casque to th' cushion, but commanding peace
    Even with the same austerity and garb
    As he controll'd the war; but one of these-
    As he hath spices of them all- not all,
    For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,
    So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit
    To choke it in the utt'rance. So our virtues
    Lie in th' interpretation of the time;
    And power, unto itself most commendable,
    Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
    T' extol what it hath done.
    One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
    Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
    Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
    Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
                                                          Exeunt

COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said
    Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him
    In a most dear particular. He call'd me father;
    But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him:
    A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
    The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd
    To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS

COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Do you hear?

COMINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Yet one time he did call me by my name.
    I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
    That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus'
    He would not answer to; forbid all names;
    He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
    Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
    Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS
3
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Why, so! You have made good work.
    A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
    To make coals cheap- a noble memory!

COMINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
    When it was less expected; he replied,
    It was a bare petition of a state
    To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS
3
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Very well.
    Could he say less?

COMINIUS
3
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I offer'd to awaken his regard
    For's private friends; his answer to me was,
    He could not stay to pick them in a pile
    Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folly,
    For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt
    And still to nose th' offence.

MENENIUS
3
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
For one poor grain or two!
    I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,
    And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
    You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
    Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
    In this so never-needed help, yet do not
    Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
    Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
    More than the instant army we can make,
    Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS

COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
No; I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Pray you go to him.

MENENIUS

COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What should I do?

BRUTUS

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
Only make trial what your love can do
    For Rome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS
3
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Well, and say that Marcius
    Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
    Unheard- what then?
    But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
    With his unkindness? Say't be so?

SICINIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Yet your good will
    Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
    As you intended well.

MENENIUS
3
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I'll undertake't;
    I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip
    And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
    He was not taken well: he had not din'd;
    The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
    We pout upon the morning, are unapt
    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
    These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
    With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
    Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him
    Till he be dieted to my request,
    And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS

MENENIUS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
You know the very road into his kindness
    And cannot lose your way.

MENENIUS

Good faith, I'll prove him,
    Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
    Of my success.                                          Exit

COMINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
    Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury
    The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
    'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
    Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do,
    He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
    Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions;
    So that all hope is vain,
    Unless his noble mother and his wife,
    Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
    For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,
    And with our fair entreaties haste them on.           Exeunt

Good my friends,
    If you have heard your general talk of Rome
    And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
    My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.

FIRST WATCH

MENENIUS
Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name
    Is not here passable.

MENENIUS

I tell thee, fellow,
    Thy general is my lover. I have been
    The book of his good acts whence men have read
    His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;
    For I have ever verified my friends-
    Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity
    Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,
    Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
    I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
    Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fellow,
    I must have leave to pass.

FIRST WATCH
0
MENENIUS
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf
    as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here;
    no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely.
    Therefore go back.

MENENIUS

Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always
    factionary on the party of your general.

SECOND WATCH

MENENIUS
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you

You are a Roman, are you?

I am as thy general is.

FIRST WATCH

Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
    you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in
    a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think
    to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the
    virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied
    intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
    think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
    in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore
    back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd;
    our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.

Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me

MENENIUS
What's the matter?

MENENIUS

Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall
    know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack
    guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my
    entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of
    hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller
    in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come
    upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
    particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
    Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;
    look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come
    to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I
    have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to
    pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage
    thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,
    who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.

CORIOLANUS

MENENIUS
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
    Are servanted to others. Though I owe
    My revenge properly, my remission lies
    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
    Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
    Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.
    Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
    Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,
    Take this along; I writ it for thy sake     [Gives a letter]
    And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,
    I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
    Was my belov'd in Rome; yet thou behold'st.

    He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another.

AUFIDIUS
We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
    Set down our host. My partner in this action,
    You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly
    I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS

CORIOLANUS
Only their ends
    You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
    The general suit of Rome; never admitted
    A private whisper- no, not with such friends
    That thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS

AUFIDIUS
This last old man,
    Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
    Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
    Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
    Was to send him; for whose old love I have-
    Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd
    The first conditions, which they did refuse
    And cannot now accept. To grace him only,
    That thought he could do more, a very little
    I have yielded to; fresh embassies and suits,
    Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
    Will I lend ear to.  [Shout within]  Ha! what shout is this?
    Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
    In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
       Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, VALERIA,
                   YOUNG MARCIUS, with attendants
    My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould
    Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand
    The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
    All bond and privilege of nature, break!
    Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
    What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,
    Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
    Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
    As if Olympus to a molehill should
    In supplication nod; and my young boy
    Hath an aspect of intercession which
    Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
    Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll never
    Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
    As if a man were author of himself
    And knew no other kin.

Like a dull actor now
    I have forgot my part and I am out,

    Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,
    For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
    Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
    Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
    I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
    Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
    And the most noble mother of the world
    Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' th' earth;       [Kneels]

    The thing I have forsworn to grant may never

    Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate

    Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA

O, no more, no more!
    You have said you will not grant us any thing-
    For we have nothing else to ask but that
    Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
    That, if you fail in our request, the blame
    May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS

Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
    Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA

AUFIDIUS
CORIOLANUS
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
    And state of bodies would bewray what life
    We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
    How more unfortunate than all living women
    Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
    Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
    Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
    Making the mother, wife, and child, to see
    The son, the husband, and the father, tearing
    His country's bowels out. And to poor we
    Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us
    Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
    That all but we enjoy. For how can we,
    Alas, how can we for our country pray,
    Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
    Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
    The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
    Our comfort in the country. We must find
    An evident calamity, though we had
    Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
    Must as a foreign recreant be led
    With manacles through our streets, or else
    Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
    And bear the palm for having bravely shed
    Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
    I purpose not to wait on fortune till
    These wars determine; if I can not persuade thee
    Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
    Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
    March to assault thy country than to tread-
    Trust to't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb
    That brought thee to this world.

Nay, go not from us thus.
    If it were so that our request did tend
    To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
    The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us
    As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit
    Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
    May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans
    'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
    Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest
    For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
    The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
    That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
    Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
    But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
    Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
    To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son.
    Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
    To imitate the graces of the gods,
    To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,
    And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
    That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
    Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
    Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
    He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;
    Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
    Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
    More bound to's mother, yet here he lets me prate
    Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
    Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
    When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
    Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home
    Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
    And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
    Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
    That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
    To a mother's part belongs. He turns away.
    Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
    To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
    Than pity to our prayers. Down. An end;
    This is the last. So we will home to Rome,
    And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!
    This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
    But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
    Does reason our petition with more strength
    Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go.
    This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
    His wife is in Corioli, and his child
    Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.
    I am hush'd until our city be afire,
    And then I'll speak a little.
                              [He holds her by the hand, silent]

AUFIDIUS
O mother, mother!
    What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
    The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
    They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
    You have won a happy victory to Rome;
    But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!-
    Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
    If not most mortal to him. But let it come.
    Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
    I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
    Were you in my stead, would you have heard
    A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS
1
CORIOLANUS
I was mov'd withal.

CORIOLANUS
1
AUFIDIUS
I dare be sworn you were!
    And, sir, it is no little thing to make
    Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
    What peace you'fl make, advise me. For my part,
    I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you
    Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS

CORIOLANUS
 [Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy
      honour
    At difference in thee. Out of that I'll work
    Myself a former fortune.

CORIOLANUS

AUFIDIUS
 [To the ladies]  Ay, by and by;
    But we will drink together; and you shall bear
    A better witness back than words, which we,
    On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
    Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
    To have a temple built you. All the swords
    In Italy, and her confederate arms,
    Could not have made this peace.                       Exeunt

See you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornerstone?

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
Why, what of that?

MENENIUS
1
SICINIUS
If it be possible for you to displace it with your little
    finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his
    mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't;
    our throats are sentenc'd, and stay upon execution.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
    condition of a man?

MENENIUS

SICINIUS
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet
    your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to
    dragon; he has wings, he's more than a creeping thing.

SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
He lov'd his mother dearly.

MENENIUS
1
SICINIUS
So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now
    than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe
    grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground
    shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with
    his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in
    his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is
    finish'd with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but
    eternity, and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS
1
SICINIUS
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother
    shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is
    milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find. And all this
    is 'long of you.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS

SICINIUS
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us.
    When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to
    break our necks, they respect not us.

Sir, if you'd save your life, fly to your house.
    The plebeians have got your fellow tribune
    And hale him up and down; all swearing if
    The Roman ladies bring not comfort home
    They'll give him death by inches.
                         Enter another MESSENGER

What's the news?

SECOND MESSENGER

MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Good news, good news! The ladies have prevail'd,
    The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.
    A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
    No, not th' expulsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
Friend,
    Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?

SECOND MESSENGER

MENENIUS
SICINIUS
As certain as I know the sun is fire.
    Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
    Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide
    As the recomforted through th' gates. Why, hark you!
                  [Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together]
    The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,
    Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans,
    Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [A shout within]

MENENIUS
1
SICINIUS
This is good news.
    I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
    Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
    A city full; of tribunes such as you,
    A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
    This morning for ten thousand of your throats
    I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
                                   [Sound still with the shouts]

    Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
    Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse

    Most welcome!

AUFIDIUS
How is it with our general?

AUFIDIUS
0
Even so
    As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
    And with his charity slain.

SECOND CONSPIRATOR

AUFIDIUS
Most noble sir,
    If you do hold the same intent wherein
    You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
    Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS
0
Sir, I cannot tell;
    We must proceed as we do find the people.

THIRD CONSPIRATOR

AUFIDIUS
The people will remain uncertain whilst
    'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
    Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS
0
I know it;
    And my pretext to strike at him admits
    A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
    Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd,
    He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,
    Seducing so my friends; and to this end
    He bow'd his nature, never known before
    But to be rough, unswayable, and free.

THIRD CONSPIRATOR
0
AUFIDIUS
Sir, his stoutness
    When he did stand for consul, which he lost
    By lack of stooping-

AUFIDIUS
0
That I would have spoken of.
    Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,
    Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;
    Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
    In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
    Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
    My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments
    In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
    Which he did end all his, and took some pride
    To do myself this wrong. Till, at the last,
    I seem'd his follower, not partner; and
    He wag'd me with his countenance as if
    I had been mercenary.

FIRST CONSPIRATOR
0
AUFIDIUS
So he did, my lord.
    The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last,
    When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
    For no less spoil than glory-

AUFIDIUS
0
There was it;
    For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
    At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
    As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
    Of our great action; therefore shall he die,
    And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
                                                      [Drums and
                trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people]

FIRST CONSPIRATOR

AUFIDIUS
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
    And had no welcomes home; but he returns
    Splitting the air with noise.

SECOND CONSPIRATOR
0
AUFIDIUS
And patient fools,
    Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
    With giving him glory.

THIRD CONSPIRATOR
0
AUFIDIUS
Therefore, at your vantage,
    Ere he express himself or move the people
    With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
    Which we will second. When he lies along,
    After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
    His reasons with his body.

Say no more:
    Here come the lords.
                     Enter the LORDS of the city

    What I have written to you?

LORDS

AUFIDIUS
We have.

FIRST LORD

AUFIDIUS
And grieve to hear't.
    What faults he made before the last, I think
    Might have found easy fines; but there to end
    Where he was to begin, and give away
    The benefit of our levies, answering us
    With our own charge, making a treaty where
    There was a yielding- this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS
0
He approaches; you shall hear him.
            Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours;
                      the commoners being with him

CORIOLANUS

AUFIDIUS
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier;
    No more infected with my country's love
    Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
    Under your great command. You are to know
    That prosperously I have attempted, and
    With bloody passage led your wars even to
    The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
    Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
    The charges of the action. We have made peace
    With no less honour to the Antiates
    Than shame to th' Romans; and we here deliver,
    Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,
    Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what
    We have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS
0
Read it not, noble lords;
    But tell the traitor in the highest degree
    He hath abus'd your powers.

Marcius!

AUFIDIUS

Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think
    I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
    Coriolanus, in Corioli?
    You lords and heads o' th' state, perfidiously
    He has betray'd your business and given up,
    For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
    I say your city- to his wife and mother;
    Breaking his oath and resolution like
    A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
    Counsel o' th' war; but at his nurse's tears
    He whin'd and roar'd away your victory,
    That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart
    Look'd wond'ring each at others.

Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
    Too great for what contains it. 'Boy'! O slave!
    Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
    I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
    Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion-
    Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that
    Must bear my beating to his grave- shall join
    To thrust the lie unto him.

FIRST LORD

AUFIDIUS
Peace, both, and hear me speak.

AUFIDIUS
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
    Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound!
    If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there
    That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
    Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli.
    Alone I did it. 'Boy'!

AUFIDIUS

Why, noble lords,
    Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
    Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
    Fore your own eyes and ears?

AUFIDIUS
Let him die for't.

Tear him to pieces. Do it presently. He kill'd my

AUFIDIUS
Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!
    The man is noble, and his fame folds in
    This orb o' th' earth. His last offences to us
    Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
    And trouble not the peace.
