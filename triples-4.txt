We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.

Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

He has no equal.

When we were chosen tribunes for the people-

Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

Nay, but his taunts!

Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.

To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
BRUTUS
1
CORIOLANUS
You see how he intends to use the people.
SICINIUS
1
CORIOLANUS
May they perceive's intent! He will require them
BRUTUS
1
CORIOLANUS
Come, we'll inform them
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to
SECOND CITIZEN
0
We may, sir, if we will.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
FIRST CITIZEN
0
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
THIRD CITIZEN
0
We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Why that way?
THIRD CITIZEN
0
To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts
SECOND CITIZEN
0
YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's
ALL
0
Content, content.                         Exeunt citizens
MENENIUS
0
O sir, you are not right; have you not known
CORIOLANUS
0
What must I say?
MENENIUS
0
O me, the gods!
CORIOLANUS
0
Think upon me? Hang 'em!
MENENIUS
0
You'll mar all.
CORIOLANUS
0
Bid them wash their faces
THIRD CITIZEN
0
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
CORIOLANUS
0
Mine own desert.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Your own desert?
CORIOLANUS
0
Ay, not mine own desire.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
How, not your own desire?
CORIOLANUS
0
No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
THIRD CITIZEN
0
YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to
CORIOLANUS
0
Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?
FIRST CITIZEN
0
The price is to ask it kindly.
CORIOLANUS
0
Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show
SECOND CITIZEN
0
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
CORIOLANUS
0
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
But this is something odd.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.
CORIOLANUS
0
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
CORIOLANUS
0
Your enigma?
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have
CORIOLANUS

You should account me the more virtuous, that I have
FIFTH CITIZEN

We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
FOURTH CITIZEN

You have received many wounds for your country.
CORIOLANUS

I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I

The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
CORIOLANUS

Most sweet voices!
SIXTH CITIZEN

He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
SEVENTH CITIZEN

Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him

Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

MENENIUS
Worthy voices!
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Is this done?
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
The custom of request you have discharg'd.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Where? At the Senate House?
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
There, Coriolanus.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
May I change these garments?
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
You may, sir.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
I'll keep you company. Will you along?
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
We stay here for the people.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Fare you well.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Fare you well.
                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
With a proud heart he wore
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
He has our voices, sir.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
SECOND CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
THIRD CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Certainly;
FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.
SECOND CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Why, so he did, I am sure.
ALL
1
MENENIUS
No, no; no man saw 'em.
THIRD CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
He said he had wounds which he could show in
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Could you not have told him-
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Thus to have said,
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Did you perceive
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Have you
THIRD CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
SECOND CITIZENS
1
MENENIUS
And will deny him;
FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Let them assemble;
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Lay
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Say you chose him
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
One thus descended,
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Say you ne'er had done't-
CITIZENS
1
MENENIUS
will will so; almost all
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Let them go on;
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
To th' Capitol, come.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?
LARTIUS
1
MENENIUS
He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
They are worn, Lord Consul, so
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Saw you Aufidius?
LARTIUS
1
MENENIUS
On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Spoke he of me?
LARTIUS
1
MENENIUS
He did, my lord.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
How? What?
LARTIUS
1
MENENIUS
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
At Antium lives he?
LARTIUS
1
MENENIUS
At Antium.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Pass no further.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Ha! What is that?
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
It will be dangerous to go on- no further.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
What makes this change?
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
The matter?
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Cominius, no.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Have I had children's voices?
FIRST SENATOR
1
MENENIUS
Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
The people are incens'd against him.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Stop,
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Are these your herd?
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Be calm, be calm.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Call't not a plot.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Why, this was known before.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Not to them all.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Have you inform'd them sithence?
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
How? I inform them!
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
You are like to do such business.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Not unlike
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
You show too much of that
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Let's be calm.
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Tell me of corn!
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Not now, not now.
FIRST SENATOR
1
MENENIUS
Not in this heat, sir, now.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Now, as I live, I will.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Well, no more.
FIRST SENATOR
1
MENENIUS
No more words, we beseech you.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
How? no more!
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
You speak o' th' people
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
'Twere well
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
What, what? his choler?
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Choler!
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
It is a mind
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Shall remain!
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
'Twas from the canon.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
'Shall'!
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Well, on to th' market-place.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Well, well, no more of that.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Why shall the people give
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
I'll give my reasons,
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Come, enough.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Enough, with over measure.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
No, take more.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Has said enough.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Manifest treason!
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
This a consul? No.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
The aediles, ho!
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Go call the people,  [Exit AEDILE]  in whose name myself
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Hence, old goat!
PATRICIANS
1
MENENIUS
We'll surety him.
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Ag'd sir, hands off.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Help, ye citizens!
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
On both sides more respect.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Seize him, aediles.
SECOND SENATOR

MENENIUS
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
ALL

MENENIUS
Hear me, people; peace!
PLEBEIANS
1
MENENIUS
Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
You are at point to lose your liberties.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Fie, fie, fie!
FIRST SENATOR
1
MENENIUS
To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
What is the city but the people?
PLEBEIANS
1
MENENIUS
True,
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
By the consent of all we were establish'd
PLEBEIANS
1
MENENIUS
You so remain.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
And so are like to do.
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
That is the way to lay the city flat,
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
This deserves death.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Or let us stand to our authority
SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Therefore lay hold of him;
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
AEdiles, seize him.
PLEBEIANS
1
MENENIUS
Yield, Marcius, yield.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,
AEDILES
1
MENENIUS
Peace, peace!
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Sir, those cold ways,
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
No: I'll die here.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Lay hands upon him.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Help Marcius, help,
PLEBEIANS
1
MENENIUS
Down with him, down with him!
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away.
SECOND SENATOR
1
MENENIUS
Get you gone.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
Stand fast;
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Shall it be put to that?
FIRST SENATOR
1
MENENIUS
The gods forbid!
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
For 'tis a sore upon us
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Come, sir, along with us.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
I would they were barbarians, as they are,
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Be gone.
CORIOLANUS
1
MENENIUS
On fair ground
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
I could myself
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
Pray you be gone.
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Nay, come away.
COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Nay, come away.
                     Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with others
PATRICIANS
1
MENENIUS
This man has marr'd his fortune.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
His nature is too noble for the world:
PATRICIANS
1
MENENIUS
I would they were a-bed.
MENENIUS
1
MENENIUS
I would they were in Tiber.
MENENIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
I would they were in Tiber.
    What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?
SICINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Where is this viper
MENENIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
You worthy Tribunes-
SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
FIRST CITIZEN

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He shall well know
PLEBEIANS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He shall, sure on't.
MENENIUS

BRUTUS
Sir, sir-
SICINIUS

BRUTUS
Peace!
MENENIUS

Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
SICINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Sir, how comes't that you
MENENIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Hear me speak.
SICINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Consul! What consul?
MENENIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
The consul Coriolanus.
BRUTUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He consul!
PLEBEIANS

No, no, no, no, no.
MENENIUS

If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
SICINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Speak briefly, then,
MENENIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Now the good gods forbid
SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He's a disease that must be cut away.
MENENIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
This is clean kam.
BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Merely awry. When he did love his country,

BRUTUS
We'll hear no more.
MENENIUS

Return to th' tribunes.
CORIOLANUS
0
Well, what then, what then?
MENENIUS
0
Repent what you have spoke.
CORIOLANUS
0
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
VOLUMNIA
0
You are too absolute;
CORIOLANUS
0
Tush, tush!
MENENIUS
0
A good demand.
VOLUMNIA
0
If it be honour in your wars to seem
CORIOLANUS

Why force you this?
VOLUMNIA

Because that now it lies you on to speak

Noble lady!

Only fair speech.

Come, come, we'll prompt you.
VOLUMNIA

Well, I must do't.

At thy choice, then.

Away! The tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself
CORIOLANUS

Well, mildly be it then- mildly.            Exeunt
BRUTUS

In this point charge him home, that he affects

He's coming.
BRUTUS

How accompanied?

With old Menenius, and those senators
SICINIUS

Have you a catalogue
AEDILE

I have; 'tis ready.
SICINIUS

Have you corrected them by tribes?
AEDILE

I have.
SICINIUS

Assemble presently the people hither;

Very well.

Well, well! No more.

What is the matter,

Answer to us.
CORIOLANUS

Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.

AEDILE
We charge you that you have contriv'd to take

How- traitor?
MENENIUS
1
AEDILE
Nay, temperately! Your promise.

Is this the promise that you made your mother?
COMINIUS

Know, I pray you-
CORIOLANUS

AEDILE
I'll know no further.
SICINIUS

AEDILE
For that he has-
SICINIUS

AEDILE
For that he has-
    As much as in him lies- from time to time
    Envied against the people, seeking means
    To pluck away their power; as now at last
    Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
    Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
    That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,
    And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
    Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,
    In peril of precipitation
    From off the rock Tarpeian, never more

YOU common cry of curs, whose breath I hate
    As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize
    As the dead carcasses of unburied men
    That do corrupt my air- I banish you.
    And here remain with your uncertainty!
    Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts;
    Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
    Fan you into despair! Have the power still
    To banish your defenders, till at length
    Your ignorance- which finds not till it feels,
    Making but reservation of yourselves
    Still your own foes- deliver you
    As most abated captives to some nation
    That won you without blows! Despising
    For you the city, thus I turn my back;

Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
FIRST SERVANT

I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always

Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son

Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
