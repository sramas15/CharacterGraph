I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county,

Thy mother's son! Like enough; and thy father's shadow.

Do you like him, Sir John?

Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him; for we have a

Thou art a very ragged wart.

Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
FALSTAFF

She lives, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
0
She never could away with me.
FALSTAFF

Never, never; she would always say she could not abide

By the mass, I could anger her to th' heart. She was then

Old, old, Master Shallow.

Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;

That's fifty-five year ago.

'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your Grace.

Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth
HASTINGS

We have sent forth already.
ARCHBISHOP

'Tis well done.
MOWBRAY

Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
HASTINGS

Now, what news?
MESSENGER

West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
MOWBRAY
0
The just proportion that we gave them out.
ARCHBISHOP

What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
MOWBRAY
0
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
WESTMORELAND
0
Health and fair greeting from our general,
ARCHBISHOP
0
Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace,
WESTMORELAND
0
Then, my lord,
ARCHBISHOP
0
Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.
WESTMORELAND
0
When ever yet was your appeal denied;
ARCHBISHOP
0
My brother general, the commonwealth,
WESTMORELAND
0
There is no need of any such redress;
MOWBRAY
0
Why not to him in part, and to us all
WESTMORELAND
0
O my good Lord Mowbray,
MOWBRAY
0
What thing, in honour, had my father lost
WESTMORELAND
0
You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
MOWBRAY
0
But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer;
WESTMORELAND
0
Mowbray. you overween to take it so.
MOWBRAY
0
Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
WESTMORELAND
0
That argues but the shame of your offence:
HASTINGS
0
Hath the Prince John a full commission,
WESTMORELAND
0
That is intended in the general's name.
ARCHBISHOP
0
Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
WESTMORELAND
0
This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
ARCHBISHOP
0
My lord, we will do so.          Exit WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY
0
There is a thing within my bosom tells me
HASTINGS
0
Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
MOWBRAY
0
Yea, but our valuation shall be such
ARCHBISHOP
0
No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
HASTINGS
0
Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods
ARCHBISHOP
0
'Tis very true;
MOWBRAY
0
Be it so.
MOWBRAY
1
WESTMORELAND
Be it so.
    Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.

You are well encount'red here, my cousin Mowbray.

And though we here fall down,

Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
PRINCE JOHN
0
I like them all and do allow them well;
ARCHBISHOP
0
I take your princely word for these redresses.
PRINCE JOHN

I give it you, and will maintain my word;
HASTINGS

Go, Captain, and deliver to the army
ARCHBISHOP

To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
WESTMORELAND

I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains
ARCHBISHOP

I do not doubt you.
WESTMORELAND

I am glad of it.
MOWBRAY

You wish me health in very happy season,

Against ill chances men are ever merry;
WESTMORELAND

Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
ARCHBISHOP

Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
MOWBRAY
0
So much the worse, if your own rule be true.
PRINCE JOHN
0
The word of peace is rend'red. Hark, how they shout!
MOWBRAY
0
This had been cheerful after victory.
ARCHBISHOP

A peace is of the nature of a conquest;

It is, my lord.

How now! Rain within doors, and none abroad!
PRINCE HUMPHREY

Exceeding ill.

Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him.

Not so much noise, my lords. Sweet Prince, speak low;

Let us withdraw into the other room.
WARWICK

Will't please your Grace to go along with us?
PRINCE

No; I will sit and watch here by the King.
KING

Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!

What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?
KING

Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

We left the Prince my brother here, my liege,

This door is open; he is gone this way.
PRINCE HUMPHREY

He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.

Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?

When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.

The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, seek him out.
KING

WARWICK
The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, seek him out.
    Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
    My sleep my death?
    Find him, my lord of Warwick; chide him hither.
                                                    Exit WARWICK
    This part of his conjoins with my disease
    And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
    How quickly nature falls into revolt
    When gold becomes her object!
    For this the foolish over-careful fathers
    Have broke their sleep with thoughts,
    Their brains with care, their bones with industry;
    For this they have engrossed and pil'd up
    The cank'red heaps of strange-achieved gold;
    For this they have been thoughtful to invest
    Their sons with arts and martial exercises;
    When, like the bee, tolling from every flower
    The virtuous sweets,
    Our thighs with wax, our mouths with honey pack'd,
    We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,
    Are murd'red for our pains. This bitter taste
    Yields his engrossments to the ending father.

I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.
    How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
    I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,
    So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;
    But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.
    Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
    Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
    For thee thrice wider than for other men-
    Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;
    Presume not that I am the thing I was,
    For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
    That I have turn'd away my former self;
    So will I those that kept me company.
    When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
    Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
    The tutor and the feeder of my riots.
    Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,
    As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
    Not to come near our person by ten mile.
    For competence of life I will allow you,
    That lack of means enforce you not to evils;
    And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
    We will, according to your strengths and qualities,
    Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,
    To see perform'd the tenour of our word.
