Good day, sir.

PAINTER

POET
I am glad y'are well.

POET

I have not seen you long; how goes the world?

PAINTER
2
POET
MERCHANT
It wears, sir, as it grows.

POET
2
MERCHANT
PAINTER
Ay, that's well known.
But what particular rarity? What strange,
Which manifold record not matches? See,
Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power
Hath conjur'd to attend! I know the merchant.

PAINTER

POET
MERCHANT
JEWELLER
I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.

MERCHANT

POET
JEWELLER
PAINTER
O, 'tis a worthy lord!

JEWELLER
2
MERCHANT
PAINTER
Nay, that's most fix'd.

MERCHANT
2
JEWELLER
PAINTER
A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,
To an untirable and continuate goodness.
He passes.

JEWELLER
2
MERCHANT
POET
I have a jewel here-

MERCHANT
2
POET
JEWELLER
O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?

JEWELLER
2
MERCHANT
POET
If he will touch the estimate. But for that-

POET
2
MERCHANT
JEWELLER
When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good.

MERCHANT

POET
JEWELLER
PAINTER
[Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.

JEWELLER

MERCHANT
POET
PAINTER
And rich. Here is a water, look ye.

PAINTER
3
MERCHANT
POET
JEWELLER
You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
To the great lord.

POET
2
JEWELLER
PAINTER
A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
From whence 'tis nourish'd. The fire i' th' flint
Shows not till it be struck: our gentle flame
Provokes itself, and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?

PAINTER
2
POET
JEWELLER
A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?

POET
1
PAINTER
Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Let's see your piece.

PAINTER
1
POET
'Tis a good piece.

POET
1
PAINTER
So 'tis; this comes off well and excellent.

PAINTER
1
POET
Indifferent.

POET
1
PAINTER
Admirable. How this grace
Speaks his own standing! What a mental power
This eye shoots forth! How big imagination
Moves in this lip! To th' dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret.

PAINTER
1
POET
It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Here is a touch; is't good?

POET
1
PAINTER
I will say of it
It tutors nature. Artificial strife
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.

PAINTER
1
POET
How this lord is followed!

POET
1
PAINTER
The senators of Athens- happy man!

PAINTER
1
POET
Look, moe!

POET
1
PAINTER
You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
I have in this rough work shap'd out a man
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment. My free drift
Halts not particularly, but moves itself
In a wide sea of tax. No levell'd malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold,
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Leaving no tract behind.

PAINTER
1
POET
How shall I understand you?

POET
1
PAINTER
I will unbolt to you.
You see how all conditions, how all minds-
As well of glib and slipp'ry creatures as
Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself; even he drops down
The knee before him, and returns in peace
Most rich in Timon's nod.

PAINTER
1
POET
I saw them speak together.

POET
1
PAINTER
Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Feign'd Fortune to be thron'd. The base o' th' mount
Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states. Amongst them all
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals.

PAINTER
1
POET
'Tis conceiv'd to scope.
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
Bowing his head against the steepy mount
To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
In our condition.

POET
1
PAINTER
Nay, sir, but hear me on.
All those which were his fellows but of late-
Some better than his value- on the moment
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Drink the free air.

PAINTER
1
POET
Ay, marry, what of these?

POET
1
PAINTER
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Not one accompanying his declining foot.

PAINTER
1
POET
'Tis common.
A thousand moral paintings I can show
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
The foot above the head.

TIMON

POET
MESSENGER
PAINTER
Imprison'd is he, say you?

MESSENGER
2
TIMON
PAINTER
Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt;
His means most short, his creditors most strait.
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up; which failing,
Periods his comfort.

TIMON
2
MESSENGER
PAINTER
Noble Ventidius! Well.
I am not of that feather to shake of
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
Which he shall have. I'll pay the debt, and free him.

MESSENGER
1
TIMON
Your lordship ever binds him.

TIMON
1
MESSENGER
Commend me to him; I will send his ransom;
And being enfranchis'd, bid him come to me.
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
But to support him after. Fare you well.

MESSENGER
1
TIMON
All happiness to your honour!

OLD ATHENIAN
1
TIMON
Lord Timon, hear me speak.

TIMON
1
OLD ATHENIAN
Freely, good father.

OLD ATHENIAN
1
TIMON
Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
I have so; what of him?

OLD ATHENIAN
2
TIMON
LUCILIUS
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!

LUCILIUS
2
TIMON
OLD ATHENIAN
Here, at your lordship's service.

OLD ATHENIAN
2
LUCILIUS
TIMON
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
By night frequents my house. I am a man
That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift,
And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
Than one which holds a trencher.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
Well; what further?

OLD ATHENIAN
2
TIMON
LUCILIUS
One only daughter have I, no kin else,
On whom I may confer what I have got.
The maid is fair, o' th' youngest for a bride,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love; I prithee, noble lord,
Join with me to forbid him her resort;
Myself have spoke in vain.

TIMON
1
OLD ATHENIAN
The man is honest.

OLD ATHENIAN
1
TIMON
Therefore he will be, Timon.
His honesty rewards him in itself;
It must not bear my daughter.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
Does she love him?

OLD ATHENIAN
2
TIMON
LUCILIUS
She is young and apt:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levity's in youth.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
Love you the maid?

LUCILIUS
2
TIMON
OLD ATHENIAN
Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.

OLD ATHENIAN
2
LUCILIUS
TIMON
If in her marriage my consent be missing,
I call the gods to witness I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
And dispossess her all.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
How shall she be endow'd,
If she be mated with an equal husband?

OLD ATHENIAN
2
TIMON
LUCILIUS
Three talents on the present; in future, all.

TIMON
2
LUCILIUS
OLD ATHENIAN
This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long;.
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
And make him weigh with her.

OLD ATHENIAN
2
TIMON
LUCILIUS
Most noble lord,
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.

TIMON

I thank you; you shall hear from me anon;
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?

PAINTER

TIMON
POET
A piece of painting, which I do beseech
Your lordship to accept.

TIMON
3
POET
JEWELLER
PAINTER
Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man;
For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
He is but outside; these pencill'd figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work,
And you shall find I like it; wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.

PAINTER
2
TIMON
JEWELLER
The gods preserve ye!

TIMON
2
JEWELLER
PAINTER
Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand;
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
Hath suffered under praise.

JEWELLER
2
TIMON
PAINTER
What, my lord! Dispraise?

TIMON
3
MERCHANT
JEWELLER
PAINTER
A mere satiety of commendations;
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
It would unclew me quite.

JEWELLER
2
TIMON
MERCHANT
My lord, 'tis rated
As those which sell would give; but you well know
Things of like value, differing in the owners,
Are prized by their masters. Believe't, dear lord,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.

TIMON
2
MERCHANT
JEWELLER
Well mock'd.

MERCHANT
2
TIMON
JEWELLER
No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
Which all men speak with him.

TIMON
2
MERCHANT
JEWELLER
Look who comes here; will you be chid?

JEWELLER
2
TIMON
MERCHANT
We'll bear, with your lordship.

MERCHANT

He'll spare none.

APEMANTUS
JEWELLER
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
MERCHANT
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.

TIMON
2
MERCHANT
APEMANTUS
Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st them not.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
JEWELLER
Are they not Athenians?

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
JEWELLER
Yes.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
JEWELLER
Then I repent not.

JEWELLER
2
TIMON
APEMANTUS
You know me, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
JEWELLER
Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
JEWELLER
Thou art proud, Apemantus.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
JEWELLER
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Whither art going?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
That's a deed thou't die for.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Right, if doing nothing be death by th' law.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
PAINTER
The best, for the innocence.

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
PAINTER
Wrought he not well that painted it?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
PAINTER
He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's
but a filthy piece of work.

PAINTER
2
TIMON
APEMANTUS
Y'are a dog.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
PAINTER
Thy mother's of my generation; what's she, if I be a dog?

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
PAINTER
Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
PAINTER
No; I eat not lords.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
That's a lascivious apprehension.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
POET
Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man
a doit.

TIMON
2
POET
APEMANTUS
What dost thou think 'tis worth?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
POET
Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!

POET
2
TIMON
APEMANTUS
How now, philosopher!

APEMANTUS
2
POET
TIMON
Thou liest.

POET
1
APEMANTUS
Art not one?

APEMANTUS

Yes.

POET

APEMANTUS
1
POET
Art not a poet?

POET
1

Yes.

APEMANTUS
2
POET
TIMON
Then thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast
feign'd him a worthy fellow.

POET
2
TIMON
APEMANTUS
That's not feign'd- he is so.

APEMANTUS
2
POET
TIMON
Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
labour. He that loves to be flattered is worthy o' th' flatterer.
Heavens, that I were a lord!

TIMON
2
POET
APEMANTUS
What wouldst do then, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
POET
E'en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
What, thyself?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
MERCHANT
Ay.

TIMON
2
MERCHANT
APEMANTUS
Wherefore?

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON

That I had no angry wit to be a lord.- Art not thou a
merchant?

MERCHANT

TIMON
APEMANTUS
Ay, Apemantus.

APEMANTUS

TIMON
Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!

'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
All of companionship.

Pray entertain them; give them guide to us.
You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you. When dinner's done
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.

TIMON
ALCIBIADES

So, so, there!
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves,
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Into baboon and monkey.

Sir, you have sav'd my longing, and I feed
Most hungerly on your sight.

SECOND LORD

He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,
Is but his steward; no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance.

Most honoured Timon,
It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age,
And call him to long peace.
He is gone happy, and has left me rich.
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart, I do return those talents,
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
I deriv'd liberty.

TIMON
2
FIRST LORD
VENTIDIUS
O, by no means,
Honest Ventidius! You mistake my love;
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives, if he receives.
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
To imitate them: faults that are rich are fair.

VENTIDIUS
2
TIMON
FIRST LORD
A noble spirit!

TIMON
3
FIRST LORD
VENTIDIUS
APEMANTUS
Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
But where there is true friendship there needs none.
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Than my fortunes to me.                           [They sit]

FIRST LORD

My lord, we always have confess'd it.

Ho, ho, confess'd it! Hang'd it, have you not?

TIMON

APEMANTUS
FIRST LORD
O, Apemantus, you are welcome.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
FIRST LORD
No;
You shall not make me welcome.
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Fie, th'art a churl; ye have got a humour there
Does not become a man; 'tis much to blame.
They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est; but yond man is ever
angry. Go, let him have a table by himself; for he does neither
affect company nor is he fit for't indeed.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.
I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
SECOND LORD
I take no heed of thee. Th'art an Athenian, therefore
welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee let my meat make
thee silent.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
SECOND LORD
I scorn thy meat; 't'would choke me, for I should ne'er
flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of men eats Timon, and he
sees 'em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one
man's blood; and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.
Methinks they should invite them without knives:
Good for their meat and safer for their lives.
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits next him now,
parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided
draught, is the readiest man to kill him. 'T has been proved. If
I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals.
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
SECOND LORD
My lord, in heart! and let the health go round.

SECOND LORD
2
TIMON
APEMANTUS
Let it flow this way, my good lord.

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
SECOND LORD
Flow this way! A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well.
Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.
Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner, honest water, which
ne'er left man i' th' mire.
This and my food are equals; there's no odds.'
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!

TIMON

Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.

ALCIBIADES

You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of

our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.

TIMON

FIRST LORD
SECOND LORD
APEMANTUS
O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have
provided that I shall have much help from you. How had you been
my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from
thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own
behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what
need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em?
They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne'er
have use for 'em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung
up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have
often wish'd myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call
our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious
comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers commanding one
another's fortunes! O, joy's e'en made away ere't can be born!
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their
faults, I drink to you.

APEMANTUS

Thou weep'st to make them drink, Timon.

Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
They dance? They are mad women.
Like madness is the glory of this life,
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves,
And spend our flatteries to drink those men
Upon whose age we void it up again
With poisonous spite and envy.
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
Of their friends' gift?
I should fear those that dance before me now
Would one day stamp upon me. 'T has been done:
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.

He commands us to provide and give great gifts,
And all out of an empty coffer;
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
Being of no power to make his wishes good.
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For ev'ry word. He is so kind that he now
Pays interest for't; his land's put to their books.
Well, would I were gently put out of office
Before I were forc'd out!
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.

And late, five thousand. To Varro and to Isidore
He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.
If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog
And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
If I would sell my horse and buy twenty moe
Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me straight,
And able horses. No porter at his gate,
But rather one that smiles and still invites
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
Can sound his state in safety. Caphis, ho!

Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon;
Importune him for my moneys; be not ceas'd
With slight denial, nor then silenc'd when
'Commend me to your master' and the cap
Plays in the right hand, thus; but tell him
My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
Out of mine own; his days and times are past,
And my reliances on his fracted dates
Have smit my credit. I love and honour him,
But must not break my back to heal his finger.
Immediate are my needs, and my relief
Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
But find supply immediate. Get you gone;
Put on a most importunate aspect,
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
When every feather sticks in his own wing,
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.

TIMON
O my good lord,
At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you; you would throw them off
And say you found them in mine honesty.
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
Yea, 'gainst th' authority of manners, pray'd you
To hold your hand more close. I did endure
Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My lov'd lord,
Though you hear now- too late!- yet now's a time:
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.

TIMON

FLAVIUS
Let all my land be sold.

FLAVIUS

'Tis all engag'd, some forfeited and gone;
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues. The future comes apace;
What shall defend the interim? And at length
How goes our reck'ning?

You tell me true.

FLAVIUS

TIMON
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
Call me before th' exactest auditors
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
When all our offices have been oppress'd
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock
And set mine eyes at flow.

TIMON

Prithee no more.

FLAVIUS

'Heavens,' have I said 'the bounty of this lord!
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
This night englutted! Who is not Lord Timon's?
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!'
Ah! when the means are gone that buy this praise,
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made.
Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter show'rs,
These flies are couch'd.

Come, sermon me no further.
No villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.

To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart:
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak.

FLAVIUS

They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
Do what they would, are sorry- you are honourable-
But yet they could have wish'd- they know not-
Something hath been amiss- a noble nature
May catch a wrench- would all were well!- 'tis pity-
And so, intending other serious matters,
After distasteful looks, and these hard fractions,
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods,
They froze me into silence.

TIMON
2
SERVANT
FLAVIUS
You gods, reward them!
Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.
Their blood is cak'd, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
Is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy.
Go to Ventidius. Prithee be not sad,
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,
No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately
Buried his father, by whose death he's stepp'd
Into a great estate. When he was poor,
Imprison'd, and in scarcity of friends,
I clear'd him with five talents. Greet him from me,
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb'red
With those five talents. That had, give't these fellows
To whom 'tis instant due. Nev'r speak or think
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.

Unto his honour has my lord's meat in him;
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment

I tell you, denied, my lord.

LUCIUS

SECOND STRANGER
What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am
asham'd on't. Denied that honourable man! There was very little
honour show'd in't. For my own part, I must needs confess I have
received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels,
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet, had he
mistook him and sent to me, I should ne'er have denied his
occasion so many talents.

me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.

May it please your honour, my lord hath sent-

LUCIUS
1
SERVILIUS
Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord:
he's ever sending. How shall I thank him, think'st thou? And what
has he sent now?

SERVILIUS
1
LUCIUS
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
talents.

LUCIUS
1
SERVILIUS
I know his lordship is but merry with me;
He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.

SERVILIUS

LUCIUS
But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
If his occasion were not virtuous
I should not urge it half so faithfully.

Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?

SERVILIUS

Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.

SERVILIUS
FIRST STRANGER
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such
a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable! How
unluckily it happ'ned that I should purchase the day before for a
little part and undo a great deal of honour! Servilius, now
before the gods, I am not able to do- the more beast, I say! I
was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can
witness; but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't
now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his
honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power
to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my
greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far
as to use mine own words to him?

SERVILIUS

Yes, sir, I shall.

Ay, too well.

FIRST STRANGER

SECOND STRANGER
THIRD STRANGER
Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him his friend
That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,
Timon has been this lord's father,
And kept his credit with his purse;
Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
Has paid his men their wages. He ne'er drinks
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
And yet- O, see the monstrousness of man
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!-
He does deny him, in respect of his,
What charitable men afford to beggars.

THIRD STRANGER

FIRST STRANGER

THIRD STRANGER
SECOND STRANGER
For mine own part,
I never tasted Timon in my life,
Nor came any of his bounties over me
To mark me for his friend; yet I protest,
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,
And honourable carriage,
Had his necessity made use of me,
I would have put my wealth into donation,
And the best half should have return'd to him,
So much I love his heart. But I perceive
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
For policy sits above conscience.

SEMPRONIUS
1
SERVANT
Must he needs trouble me in't? Hum! 'Bove all others?
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
Whom he redeem'd from prison. All these
Owe their estates unto him.

SERVANT
1
SEMPRONIUS
My lord,
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
They have all denied him.

SEMPRONIUS
1
SERVANT
How! Have they denied him?
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
And does he send to me? Three? Humh!
It shows but little love or judgment in him.
Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
Thrice give him over. Must I take th' cure upon me?
Has much disgrac'd me in't; I'm angry at him,
That might have known my place. I see no sense for't,
But his occasions might have woo'd me first;
For, in my conscience, I was the first man
That e'er received gift from him.
And does he think so backwardly of me now
That I'll requite it last? No;
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To th' rest, and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool.
I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
And with their faint reply this answer join:
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.

SERVANT

Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The devil
knew not what he did when he made man politic- he cross'd himself
by't; and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man
will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul!
Takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot
ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire.
Of such a nature is his politic love.
This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,
Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
Now to guard sure their master.
And this is all a liberal course allows:
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

Now, Captain?

ALCIBIADES

SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
For pity is the virtue of the law,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood
Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
To those that without heed do plunge into't.
He is a man, setting his fate aside,
Of comely virtues;
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice-
An honour in him which buys out his fault-
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
He did oppose his foe;
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behove his anger ere 'twas spent,
As if he had but prov'd an argument.

FIRST SENATOR
1
ALCIBIADES
You undergo too strict a paradox,
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair;
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
To bring manslaughter into form and set
Quarrelling upon the head of valour; which, indeed,
Is valour misbegot, and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born.
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe,
And make his wrongs his outsides,
To wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
To bring it into danger.
If wrongs be evils, and enforce us kill,
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

ALCIBIADES

To revenge is no valour, but to bear.

ALCIBIADES

SECOND SENATOR

My lords, then, under favour, pardon me
If I speak like a captain:
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
And not endure all threats? Sleep upon't,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
Without repugnancy? If there be
Such valour in the bearing, what make we
Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant,
That stay at home, if bearing carry it;
And the ass more captain than the lion; the fellow
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
As you are great, be pitifully good.
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
To be in anger is impiety;
But who is man that is not angry?
Weigh but the crime with this.

SECOND SENATOR

And slain in fight many of your enemies;
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!

SECOND SENATOR
2
ALCIBIADES
FIRST SENATOR
He has made too much plenty with 'em.
He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often
Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner.
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him. In that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages
And cherish factions. 'Tis inferr'd to us
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

FIRST SENATOR

ALCIBIADES
SECOND SENATOR
He dies.

ALCIBIADES
2
SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
Hard fate! He might have died in war.
My lords, if not for any parts in him-
Though his right arm might purchase his own time,
And be in debt to none- yet, more to move you,
Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both;
And, for I know your reverend ages love
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
My honours to you, upon his good returns.
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Why, let the war receive't in valiant gore;
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

FIRST SENATOR

On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,

Only in bone, that none may look on you!

Their coin upon large interest, I myself
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate
Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up

You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness.
For your own gifts make yourselves prais'd; but reserve still to

Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall
That girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent.
Obedience, fail in children! Slaves and fools,
Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench
And minister in their steads. To general filths
Convert, o' th' instant, green virginity.
Do't in your parents' eyes. Bankrupts, hold fast;
Rather than render back, out with your knives
And cut your trusters' throats. Bound servants, steal:
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed:
Thy mistress is o' th' brothel. Son of sixteen,
Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire,
With it beat out his brains. Piety and fear,
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
Degrees, observances, customs and laws,
Decline to your confounding contraries
And let confusion live. Plagues incident to men,
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens, ripe for stroke. Thou cold sciatica,
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty,
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive
And drown themselves in riot. Itches, blains,
Sow all th' Athenian bosoms, and their crop
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
That their society, as their friendship, may
Be merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee
But nakedness, thou detestable town!
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans.
Timon will to the woods, where he shall find
Th' unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
The gods confound- hear me, you good gods all-
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind, high and low!
Amen.

Such a house broke!
So noble a master fall'n! All gone, and not
One friend to take his fortune by the arm

FIRST SERVANT
FLAVIUS
As we do turn our backs
From our companion, thrown into his grave,
So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Slink all away; leave their false vows with him,
Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
A dedicated beggar to the air,
With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.

Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
That see I by our faces. We are fellows still,
Serving alike in sorrow. Leak'd is our bark;
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
Hearing the surges threat. We must all part
Into this sea of air.

FLAVIUS

Good fellows all,
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads and say,
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortune,
'We have seen better days.' Let each take some.
Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more!
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Who would be so mock'd with glory, or to live
But in a dream of friendship,
To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,
But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
When man's worst sin is he does too much good!
Who then dares to be half so kind again?
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
My dearest lord- blest to be most accurst,
Rich only to be wretched- thy great fortunes
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Of monstrous friends; nor has he with him to
Supply his life, or that which can command it.
I'll follow and enquire him out.
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb-
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
Scarce is dividant- touch them with several fortunes:
The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature,
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune
But by contempt of nature.
Raise me this beggar and deny't that lord:
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
The beggar native honour.
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
In purity of manhood stand upright,
And say 'This man's a flatterer'? If one be,
So are they all; for every grise of fortune
Is smooth'd by that below. The learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool. All's oblique;
There's nothing level in our cursed natures
But direct villainy. Therefore be abhorr'd
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains.
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots.
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison. What is here?
Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
I am no idle votarist. Roots, you clear heavens!
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Ha, you gods! why this? What, this, you gods? Why, this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads-
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions, bless th' accurs'd,
Make the hoar leprosy ador'd, place thieves
And give them title, knee, and approbation,
With senators on the bench. This is it
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again-
She whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices
To th 'April day again. Come, damn'd earth,
Thou common whore of mankind, that puts odds
Among the rout of nations, I will make thee
Do thy right nature.                        [March afar off]
Ha! a drum? Th'art quick,
But yet I'll bury thee. Thou't go, strong thief,
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.          [Keeping some gold]

For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,

I know thee well;
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.

TIMON

PHRYNIA
I know thee too; and more than that I know thee
I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules.
Religious canons, civil laws, are cruel;
Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword
For all her cherubin look.

PHRYNIA

Thy lips rot off!

TIMON

I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns

How came the noble Timon to this change?

As the moon does, by wanting light to give.
But then renew I could not, like the moon;

None, but to
Maintain my opinion.

ALCIBIADES

What is it, Timon?

TIMON

Promise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not
promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art man! If thou dost
perform, confound thee, for thou art a man!

Yes.

TIMON

TIMANDRA
Be a whore still; they love thee not that use thee.
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheek'd youth
To the tub-fast and the diet.

Hang thee, monster!

ALCIBIADES

TIMON
TIMANDRA
Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
The want whereof doth daily make revolt
In my penurious band. I have heard, and griev'd,
How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them-

TIMON

I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone.

I had rather be alone.

Why, fare thee well;
Here is some gold for thee.

TIMON

Keep it: I cannot eat it.

ALCIBIADES

TIMON
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap-

TIMON

ALCIBIADES
War'st thou 'gainst Athens?

ALCIBIADES

Ay, Timon, and have cause.

TIMON

ALCIBIADES
The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!

ALCIBIADES
1
TIMON
Why me, Timon?

TIMON
1
ALCIBIADES
That by killing of villains
Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Put up thy gold. Go on. Here's gold. Go on.
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
Will o'er some high-vic'd city hang his poison
In the sick air; let not thy sword skip one.
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard:
He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron:
It is her habit only that is honest,
Herself's a bawd. Let not the virgin's cheek
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk paps
That through the window bars bore at men's eyes
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
Think it a bastard whom the oracle
Hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut,
And mince it sans remorse. Swear against abjects;
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes,
Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay thy soldiers.
Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

ALCIBIADES
1
TIMON
Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou givest me,
Not all thy counsel.

TIMON

Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!

PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA

TIMON
ALCIBIADES
Give us some gold, good Timon.
Hast thou more?

TIMON
2
ALCIBIADES
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
And to make whores a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
Your aprons mountant; you are not oathable,
Although I know you'll swear, terribly swear,
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues,
Th' immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths;
I'll trust to your conditions. Be whores still;
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you-
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
And be no turncoats. Yet may your pains six months
Be quite contrary! And thatch your poor thin roofs
With burdens of the dead- some that were hang'd,
No matter. Wear them, betray with them. Whore still;
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face.
A pox of wrinkles!

PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA

Well, more gold. What then?
Believe't that we'll do anything for gold.

TIMON

PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA
Consumptions sow
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
That he may never more false title plead,
Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen,
That scolds against the quality of flesh
And not believes himself. Down with the nose,
Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away
Of him that, his particular to foresee,
Smells from the general weal. Make curl'd-pate ruffians bald,
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
Derive some pain from you. Plague all,
That your activity may defeat and quell
The source of all erection. There's more gold.
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
And ditches grave you all!

If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.

If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.

Thy beagles with thee.

TIMON

That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,         [Digging]
Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
Teems and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
With all th' abhorred births below crisp heaven
Whereon Hyperion's quick'ning fire doth shine-
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Never presented!- O, a root! Dear thanks!-
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas,
Whereof ingrateful man, with liquorish draughts
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
That from it all consideration slips-

APEMANTUS
2
TIMON
ALCIBIADES
I was directed hither. Men report
Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.

TIMON
2
APEMANTUS
ALCIBIADES
'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee!

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
This is in thee a nature but infected,
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
From change of fortune. Why this spade, this place?
This slave-like habit and these looks of care?
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,
Hug their diseas'd perfumes, and have forgot
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods
By putting on the cunning of a carper.
Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
And let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;
Thou gav'st thine ears, like tapsters that bade welcome,
To knaves and all approachers. 'Tis most just
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again
Rascals should have't. Do not assume my likeness.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Were I like thee, I'd throw away myself.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
Will put thy shirt on warm? Will these moist trees,
That have outliv'd the eagle, page thy heels
And skip when thou point'st out? Will the cold brook,
Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste
To cure thy o'ernight's surfeit? Call the creatures
Whose naked natures live in all the spite
Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
To the conflicting elements expos'd,
Answer mere nature- bid them flatter thee.
O, thou shalt find-

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
A fool of thee. Depart.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
I love thee better now than e'er I did.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
I hate thee worse.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Why?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Thou flatter'st misery.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Why dost thou seek me out?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
To vex thee.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Always a villain's office or a fool's.
Dost please thyself in't?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Ay.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
What, a knave too?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
To castigate thy pride, 'twere well; but thou
Dost it enforcedly. Thou'dst courtier be again
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
Outlives incertain pomp, is crown'd before.
The one is filling still, never complete;
The other, at high wish. Best state, contentless,
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
Worse than the worst, content.
Thou should'st desire to die, being miserable.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Thou art a slave whom Fortune's tender arm
With favour never clasp'd, but bred a dog.
Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
To such as may the passive drugs of it
Freely command, thou wouldst have plung'd thyself
In general riot, melted down thy youth
In different beds of lust, and never learn'd
The icy precepts of respect, but followed
The sug'red game before thee. But myself,
Who had the world as my confectionary;
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men
At duty, more than I could frame employment;
That numberless upon me stuck, as leaves
Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush
Fell from their boughs, and left me open, bare
For every storm that blows- I to bear this,
That never knew but better, is some burden.
Thy nature did commence in sufferance; time
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
They never flatter'd thee. What hast thou given?
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
Must be thy subject; who, in spite, put stuff
To some she-beggar and compounded thee
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone.
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Art thou proud yet?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Ay, that I am not thee.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
I, that I was
No prodigal.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
I, that I am one now.
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
I'd give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
That the whole life of Athens were in this!
Thus would I eat it.                         [Eating a root]

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Here! I will mend thy feast.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
First mend my company: take away thyself.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
So I shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
'Tis not well mended so; it is but botch'd.
If not, I would it were.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
What wouldst thou have to Athens?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Here is no use for gold.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
The best and truest;
For here it sleeps and does no hired harm.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Where liest a nights, Timon?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Under that's above me.
Where feed'st thou a days, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Where my stomach. finds meat; or rather, where I eat it.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Would poison were obedient, and knew my mind!

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Where wouldst thou send it?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
To sauce thy dishes.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy
perfume, they mock'd thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags
thou know'st none, but art despis'd for the contrary. There's a
medlar for thee; eat it.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
On what I hate I feed not.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Dost hate a medlar?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Ay, though it look like thee.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
An th' hadst hated medlars sooner, thou shouldst have
loved thyself better now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift
that was beloved after his means?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Who, without those means thou talk'st of, didst thou ever
know belov'd?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Myself.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
I understand thee: thou hadst some means to keep a dog.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to
thy flatterers?

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves. What
wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy
power?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and
remain a beast with the beasts?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Ay, Timon.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t' attain to!
If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert
the lamb, the fox would eat thee; if thou wert the fox, the lion
would suspect thee, when, peradventure, thou wert accus'd by the
ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dulness would torment thee; and
still thou liv'dst but as a breakfast to the wolf. If thou wert
the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou
shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn,
pride and wrath would confound thee, and make thine own self the
conquest of thy fury. Wert thou bear, thou wouldst be kill'd by
the horse; wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seiz'd by the
leopard; wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion, and
the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life. All thy safety
were remotion, and thy defence absence. What beast couldst thou
be that were not subject to a beast? And what beast art thou
already, that seest not thy loss in transformation!

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is
become a forest of beasts.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the
city?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company
light upon thee! I will fear to catch it, and give way. When I
know not what else to do, I'll see thee again.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
If I name thee.
I'll beat thee- but I should infect my hands.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
I would my tongue could rot them off!

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
I swoon to see thee.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Would thou wouldst burst!

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Away,
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Beast!

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Slave!

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Toad!

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Rogue, rogue, rogue!
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
But even the mere necessities upon't.
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
Thy gravestone daily; make thine epitaph,
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
[Looks at the gold] O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
Thou ever young, fresh, lov'd, and delicate wooer,
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
That sold'rest close impossibilities,
And mak'st them kiss! that speak'st with every tongue
To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
Think thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
May have the world in empire!

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Would 'twere so!
But not till I am dead. I'll say th' hast gold.
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Throng'd to?

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Ay.

TIMON
1
APEMANTUS
Thy back, I prithee.

APEMANTUS
1
TIMON
Live, and love thy misery!

TIMON

Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
fragment, some slender ort of his remainder. The mere want of
gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this

Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips;
The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush
Lays her full mess before you. Want! Why want?

We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
As beasts and birds and fishes.

FIRST BANDIT
BANDITTI
THIRD BANDIT
Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' th' grape
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician;
His antidotes are poison, and he slays
Moe than you rob. Take wealth and lives together;
Do villainy, do, since you protest to do't,
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery:
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n
From gen'ral excrement- each thing's a thief.
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
Has uncheck'd theft. Love not yourselves; away,
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats;
All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
Break open shops; nothing can you steal
But thieves do lose it. Steal not less for this
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er!
Amen.

FLAVIUS

TIMON
O you gods!
Is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord?
Full of decay and failing? O monument
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
What an alteration of honour
Has desp'rate want made!
What viler thing upon the earth than friends,
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
Those that would mischief me than those that do!
Has caught me in his eye; I will present
My honest grief unto him, and as my lord
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
Away! What art thou?

FLAVIUS
1
TIMON
Have you forgot me, sir?

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
Then, if thou grant'st th'art a man, I have forgot thee.

FLAVIUS
1
TIMON
An honest poor servant of yours.

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
Then I know thee not.
I never had honest man about me, I.
All I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

FLAVIUS
1
TIMON
The gods are witness,
Nev'r did poor steward wear a truer grief
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee
Because thou art a woman and disclaim'st
Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping.
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

FLAVIUS
1
TIMON
I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
T' accept my grief, and whilst this poor wealth lasts
To entertain me as your steward still.

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
Had I a steward
So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
Was born of woman.
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
One honest man- mistake me not, but one;
No more, I pray- and he's a steward.
How fain would I have hated all mankind!
And thou redeem'st thyself. But all, save thee,
I fell with curses.
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
For by oppressing and betraying me
Thou mightst have sooner got another service;
For many so arrive at second masters
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true,
For I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure,
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
If not a usuring kindness, and as rich men deal gifts,
Expecting in return twenty for one?

FLAVIUS
1
TIMON
No, my most worthy master, in whose breast
Doubt and suspect, alas, are plac'd too late!
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
Duty, and zeal, to your unmatched mind,
Care of your food and living; and believe it,
My most honour'd lord,
For any benefit that points to me,
Either in hope or present, I'd exchange
For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
To requite me by making rich yourself.

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
Here, take. The gods, out of my misery,
Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,
But thus condition'd; thou shalt build from men;
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone
Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs
What thou deniest to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
Debts wither 'em to nothing. Be men like blasted woods,
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
And so, farewell and thrive.

FLAVIUS
1
TIMON
O, let me stay
And comfort you, my master.

TIMON
1
FLAVIUS
If thou hat'st curses,
Stay not; fly whilst thou art blest and free.
Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

PAINTER

POET
As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he
abides.

POET
1
PAINTER
to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that he's
so full of gold?

PAINTER
1
POET
Certain. Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had
gold of him. He likewise enrich'd poor straggling soldiers with
great quantity. 'Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.

POET
1
PAINTER
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends?

PAINTER
1
POET
Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again,
and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender
our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his; it will show
honestly in us, and is very likely to load our purposes with what
they travail for, if it be just and true report that goes of his
having.

POET
1
PAINTER
What have you now to present unto him?

PAINTER
1
POET
Nothing at this time but my visitation; only I will
promise him an excellent piece.

POET
1
PAINTER
I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that's coming
toward him.

PAINTER
1
POET
Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' th' time;
it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance is ever the duller
for his act, and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people
the deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is most
courtly and fashionable; performance is a kind of will or
testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that
makes it.

TIMON

POET
PAINTER
[Aside] Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man so bad
as is thyself.

POET
2
TIMON
PAINTER
I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him. It
must be a personating of himself; a satire against the softness
of prosperity, with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that
follow youth and opulency.

TIMON
2
POET
PAINTER
[Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own
work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have
gold for thee.

POET
2
TIMON
PAINTER
Nay, let's seek him;
Then do we sin against our own estate
When we may profit meet and come too late.

PAINTER

POET
TIMON
True;
When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light.
Come.

TIMON

POET
PAINTER
[Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold,
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
Than where swine feed!
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
Settlest admired reverence in a slave.
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
Be crown'd with plagues, that thee alone obey!
Fit I meet them.                   [Advancing from his cave]

Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?

POET
2
TIMON
PAINTER
Sir,
Having often of your open bounty tasted,
Hearing you were retir'd, your friends fall'n off,
Whose thankless natures- O abhorred spirits!-
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough-
What! to you,
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
To their whole being! I am rapt, and cannot cover
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
With any size of words.

TIMON
2
POET
PAINTER
Let it go naked: men may see't the better.
You that are honest, by being what you are,
Make them best seen and known.

PAINTER
2
TIMON

He and myself
Have travail'd in the great show'r of your gifts,
And sweetly felt it.

TIMON

POET
PAINTER
Ay, you are honest men.

PAINTER
1
TIMON
We are hither come to offer you our service.

TIMON

PAINTER
Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water- No?

BOTH

TIMON

What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.

TIMON

Y'are honest men. Y'have heard that I have gold;
I am sure you have. Speak truth; y'are honest men.

PAINTER

TIMON

So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
Came not my friend nor I.

TIMON
2
BOTH
PAINTER
Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
Best in all Athens. Th'art indeed the best;
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.

PAINTER

TIMON
BOTH
So, so, my lord.

TIMON
2
BOTH
PAINTER
E'en so, sir, as I say. [To To POET] And for thy fiction,
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
That thou art even natural in thine art.
But for all this, my honest-natur'd friends,
I must needs say you have a little fault.
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you; neither wish I
You take much pains to mend.

BOTH
2
TIMON
PAINTER
Beseech your honour
To make it known to us.

TIMON

You'll take it ill.

That he's a made-up villain.

Nor I.

TIMON

Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
Rid me these villains from your companies.
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
Confound them by some course, and come to me,
I'll give you gold enough.

BOTH
2
TIMON
POET
Name them, my lord; let's know them.

TIMON
2
POET
BOTH
You that way, and you this- but two in company;
Each man apart, all single and alone,
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
[To the PAINTER] If, where thou art, two villians shall not be,
Come not near him. [To the POET] If thou wouldst not reside
But where one villain is, then him abandon.-
Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.
[To the PAINTER] You have work for me; there's payment; hence!
[To the POET] You are an alchemist; make gold of that.-
Out, rascal dogs!                [Beats and drives them out]

I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
Could I but catch it for them.

FIRST SENATOR

TIMON
SECOND SENATOR
O, forget
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
The senators with one consent of love
Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought
On special dignities, which vacant lie
For thy best use and wearing.

SECOND SENATOR
2
TIMON
FIRST SENATOR
They confess
Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross;
Which now the public body, which doth seldom
Play the recanter, feeling in itself
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
Of it own fail, restraining aid to Timon,
And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
And write in thee the figures of their love,
Ever to read them thine.

TIMON
2
SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
You witch me in it;
Surprise me to the very brink of tears.
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

FIRST SENATOR

TIMON
SECOND SENATOR
Therefore so please thee to return with us,
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
Live with authority. So soon we shall drive back
Of Alcibiades th' approaches wild,
Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
His country's peace.

SECOND SENATOR

Therefore, Timon-

TIMON

SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
FLAVIUS
Well, sir, I will. Therefore I will, sir, thus:
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,
And take our goodly aged men by th' beards,
Giving our holy virgins to the stain
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
Then let him know- and tell him Timon speaks it
In pity of our aged and our youth-
I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
While you have throats to answer. For myself,
There's not a whittle in th' unruly camp
But I do prize it at my love before
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
To the protection of the prosperous gods,
As thieves to keepers.

FLAVIUS

Stay not, all's in vain.

TIMON

Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
It will be seen to-morrow. My long sickness

And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
And last so long enough!

And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes

In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them-
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,

And let my gravestone be your oracle.

In part for his sake mov'd.

Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb

Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out;
Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
Into our city with thy banners spread.
By decimation and a tithed death-
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes- take thou the destin'd tenth,
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted.

FIRST SENATOR

All have not offended;
For those that were, it is not square to take,
On those that are, revenge: crimes, like lands,
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;
Spare thy Athenian cradle, and those kin
Which, in the bluster of thy wrath, must fall
With those that have offended. Like a shepherd
Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth,
But kill not all together.

My noble General, Timon is dead;
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' th' sea;
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
Interprets for my poor ignorance.
'Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft;
Seek not my name. A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!
Here lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did hate.
Pass by, and curse thy fill; but pass, and stay not here thy
These well express in thee thy latter spirits.
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
Scorn'dst our brain's flow, and those our droplets which
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
Is noble Timon, of whose memory
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
And I will use the olive, with my sword;
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
Prescribe to other, as each other's leech.
Let our drums strike.
