MARULLUS
FIRST COMMONER
Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?

FIRST COMMONER
3
FLAVIUS
SECOND COMMONER
MARULLUS
Why, sir, a carpenter.

MARULLUS

SECOND COMMONER
FIRST COMMONER
FLAVIUS
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?

SECOND COMMONER
2
MARULLUS
FIRST COMMONER
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
but, as you would say, a cobbler.

MARULLUS
2
SECOND COMMONER
FIRST COMMONER
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.

SECOND COMMONER
1
MARULLUS
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

MARULLUS
1
SECOND COMMONER
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?

SECOND COMMONER
2
MARULLUS
FLAVIUS
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

MARULLUS
2
SECOND COMMONER
FLAVIUS
What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!

SECOND COMMONER
2
MARULLUS
FLAVIUS
Why, sir, cobble you.

FLAVIUS
2
SECOND COMMONER
MARULLUS
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

SECOND COMMONER
2
MARULLUS
FLAVIUS
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I
meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with
awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in
great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.

FLAVIUS
2
SECOND COMMONER
MARULLUS
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

SECOND COMMONER
2
MARULLUS
FLAVIUS
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar
and to rejoice in his triumph.

MARULLUS
2
SECOND COMMONER
FLAVIUS
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.

FLAVIUS
2
MARULLUS
SECOND COMMONER
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
This way will I. Disrobe the images
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.

MARULLUS
2
SECOND COMMONER
FLAVIUS
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

FLAVIUS
1
MARULLUS
It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about
And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

Forget not in your speed, Antonio,
To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.

I shall remember.
When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.

Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!

CAESAR

SOOTHSAYER
CASCA
BRUTUS
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.

SOOTHSAYER

Beware the ides of March.

Beware the ides of March.

He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.

CASSIUS

SOOTHSAYER
CAESAR
BRUTUS
Will you go see the order of the course?

BRUTUS
2
CAESAR
CASSIUS
Not I.

CASSIUS
2
CAESAR
BRUTUS
I pray you, do.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have;
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Cassius,
Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
Among which number, Cassius, be you one-
Nor construe any further my neglect
Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
Forgets the shows of love to other men.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection, by some other things.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
'Tis just,
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
That you might see your shadow. I have heard
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I your glass
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester, if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
What means this shouting? I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye and death i' the other
And I will look on both indifferently.
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life, but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar, so were you;
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow. So indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!
I, as Aeneas our great ancestor
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him I did mark
How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their color fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"
As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone. Shout.                    Flourish.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
"Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age since the great flood
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.

CASSIUS
2
CAESAR
BRUTUS
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note today.

BRUTUS
2
CAESAR
CASSIUS
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.

CASSIUS
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
BRUTUS
Casca will tell us what the matter is.

CAESAR
3
ANTONY
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Antonio!

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
CASSIUS
Caesar?

CAESAR
3
CASCA
ANTONY
CASSIUS
Let me have men about me that are fat,
Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.

ANTONY
2
CASCA
CAESAR
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.

CAESAR
3
CASCA
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,
He is a great observer, and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at anything.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

CASCA
3
CAESAR
ANTONY
BRUTUS
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CAESAR
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
That Caesar looks so sad.

CASCA
2
CAESAR
BRUTUS
Why, you were with him, were you not?

BRUTUS
1
CASCA
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
What was the second noise for?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Why, for that too.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Why, for that too.

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
Was the crown offered him thrice?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
shouted.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
Who offered him the crown?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Why, Antony.

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a
crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these
coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all
that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered
it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my thinking, he
was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it
the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had
almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it. And
for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips
and receiving the bad air.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
speechless.

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do
the players in the theatre, I am no true man.

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
What said he when he came unto himself?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet
and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I
might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came
to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss,
he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or
four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and forgave
him with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken of
them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done
no less.

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
And after that he came, thus sad, away?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Ay.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
Did Cicero say anything?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Ay, he spoke Greek.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
To what effect?

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
again; but those that understood him smiled at one another and
shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I
could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling
scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well.
There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
No, I am promised forth.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
Will you dine with me tomorrow?

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
the eating.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
Good, I will expect you.

CASCA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Do so, farewell, both.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.

CASSIUS
2
CICERO
BRUTUS
So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.

BRUTUS
2
CICERO
CASSIUS
And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you, or, if you will,
Come home to me and I will wait for you.

CASSIUS
2
CICERO
BRUTUS
I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see
Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
He should not humor me. I will this night,
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings, all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

CICERO
0
Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?

CASCA
1
CICERO
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds,
But never till tonight, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world too saucy with the gods
Incenses them to send destruction.

CICERO
1
CASCA
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?

CASCA
1
CICERO
A common slave- you know him well by sight-
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand
Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword-
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by
Without annoying me. And there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noonday upon the marketplace,
Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
"These are their reasons; they are natural":
For I believe they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.

CICERO
1
CASCA
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?

CASCA
1
CICERO
He doth, for he did bid Antonio
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.

CICERO
1
CASCA
Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.

CASCA
1
CICERO
Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
CICERO
Who's there?

CASCA
2
CICERO
CASSIUS
A Roman.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
Casca, by your voice.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
A very pleasing night to honest men.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men, fools, and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance,
Their natures, and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality, why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
Let it be who it is, for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead,
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
In every place save here in Italy.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
I know where I will wear this dagger then:
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.                  Thunder still.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,
What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.

CASCA
1
CASSIUS
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.

CASSIUS
1
CASCA
There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets,
And the complexion of the element
In favor's like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

CASCA
2
CINNA
CASSIUS
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.

CASSIUS
2
CINNA
CASCA
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?

CINNA
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?

CASSIUS
2
CINNA
CASCA
No, it is Casca, one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

CINNA
1
CASSIUS
I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.

CASSIUS
1
CINNA
Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.

CINNA
1
CASSIUS
Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party-

CASSIUS
2
CINNA
CASCA
Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue. All this done,
Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

CINNA
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.

CASSIUS
2
CINNA
CASCA
That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him
Is ours already, and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.

CASCA
2
CINNA
CASSIUS
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
And that which would appear offense in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.

CASSIUS
2
CINNA
CASCA
Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
For it is after midnight, and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
Call'd you, my lord?

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
I will, my lord.

BRUTUS

It must be by his death, and, for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round,
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities;
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint I found
This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure
It did not lie there when I went to bed.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Get you to bed again, it is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
I know not, sir.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Look in the calendar and bring me word.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
I will, sir.

BRUTUS

The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them.
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
Where I have took them up.
"Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
"Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion, all the interim is
Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
The genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council, and the state of man,
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
Who doth desire to see you.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Is he alone?

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
No, sir, there are more with him.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Do you know them?

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favor.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
When evils are most free? O, then, by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
Hide it in smiles and affability;
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS, CINNA,                METELLUS, CIMBER, and TREBONIUS.

CASSIUS

BRUTUS
LUCIUS
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?

BRUTUS

CASSIUS
LUCIUS
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
But honors you, and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
He is welcome hither.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
This, Decius Brutus.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
He is welcome too.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.

DECIUS

CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?

CASCA

CASSIUS
BRUTUS
DECIUS
No.

CINNA

CASCA
BRUTUS
DECIUS
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.

CASCA
4
CINNA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
DECIUS
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
Which is a great way growing on the south,
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire, and the high east
Stands as the Capitol, directly here.

BRUTUS

CINNA
CASCA
CASSIUS
Give me your hands all over, one by one.

CASSIUS
2
CASCA
BRUTUS
And let us swear our resolution.

BRUTUS
2
CASCA
CASSIUS
No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause
To prick us to redress? What other bond
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
And will not palter? And what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged
That this shall be or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

CASSIUS
3
CINNA
CASCA
BRUTUS
But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.

CASCA

CINNA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Let us not leave him out.

CINNA
3
CASCA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
No, by no means.

METELLUS
4
CINNA
CASCA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion,
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
But all be buried in his gravity.

BRUTUS
4
CINNA
CASCA
CASSIUS
METELLUS
O, name him not; let us not break with him,
For he will never follow anything
That other men begin.

CASSIUS

CASCA
METELLUS
BRUTUS

Then leave him out.

CASCA

CASSIUS
BRUTUS

Indeed he is not fit.

DECIUS

CASCA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?

CASSIUS
3
CASCA
BRUTUS
DECIUS
Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all, which to prevent,
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
DECIUS
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious,
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
When Caesar's head is off.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
DECIUS
Yet I fear him,
For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given
To sports, to wildness, and much company.

TREBONIUS
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
There is no fear in him-let him not die,
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.

BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
CASSIUS
Peace, count the clock.

CASSIUS
3
TREBONIUS
BRUTUS
DECIUS
The clock hath stricken three.

TREBONIUS
3
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
DECIUS
'Tis time to part.

CASSIUS
3
TREBONIUS
BRUTUS
DECIUS
But it is doubtful yet
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers
May hold him from the Capitol today.

DECIUS
3
TREBONIUS
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
For I can give his humor the true bent,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.

CASSIUS
4
TREBONIUS
CINNA
BRUTUS
DECIUS
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

BRUTUS

CINNA
DECIUS
CASSIUS
METELLUS
By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?

CINNA
3
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
METELLUS
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

METELLUS

CINNA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.

BRUTUS
3
CINNA
CASSIUS
METELLUS
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
METELLUS
The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
METELLUS
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
With untired spirits and formal constancy.
And so, good morrow to you every one.
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

PORTIA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Brutus, my lord!

BRUTUS
2
PORTIA
CASSIUS
Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

PORTIA
1
BRUTUS
Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper
You suddenly arose and walk'd about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across;
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks.
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
But with an angry waiter of your hand
Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humor,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And, could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

BRUTUS
1
PORTIA
I am not well in health, and that is all.

PORTIA
1
BRUTUS
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.

BRUTUS
1
PORTIA
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

PORTIA
1
BRUTUS
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,
You have some sick offense within your mind,
Which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy and what men tonight
Have had resort to you; for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.

BRUTUS
1
PORTIA
Kneel not, gentle Portia.

PORTIA
1
BRUTUS
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

BRUTUS
2
PORTIA
LUCIUS
You are my true and honorable wife,
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart.

PORTIA
2
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman, but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
I grant I am a woman, but withal
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience
And not my husband's secrets?

BRUTUS
2
PORTIA
LUCIUS
O ye gods,
Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
All the charactery of my sad brows.
Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?

LUCIUS
3
PORTIA
LIGARIUS
BRUTUS
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.

BRUTUS
3
PORTIA
LIGARIUS
LUCIUS
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?

LIGARIUS
2
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.

BRUTUS
2
LIGARIUS
LUCIUS
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!

LIGARIUS
1
BRUTUS
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honor.

BRUTUS
1
LIGARIUS
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

LIGARIUS
1
BRUTUS
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
And I will strive with things impossible,
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?

BRUTUS
1
LIGARIUS
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

LIGARIUS
1
BRUTUS
But are not some whole that we must make sick?

BRUTUS
1
LIGARIUS
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
To whom it must be done.

LIGARIUS
1
BRUTUS
Set on your foot,
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on.

BRUTUS
1
LIGARIUS
Follow me then.

CAESAR

Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
"Help, ho! They murther Caesar!" Who's within?

SERVANT

CAESAR
My lord?

CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
And bring me their opinions of success.

SERVANT

CAESAR
I will, my lord.

CALPURNIA
1
CAESAR
What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today.

CAESAR
1
CALPURNIA
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.

CALPURNIA
1
CAESAR
Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar! These things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.

CAESAR
1
CALPURNIA
What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.

CALPURNIA
1
CAESAR
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

CAESAR
1
CALPURNIA
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.

SERVANT
2
CALPURNIA
CAESAR
They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
They could not find a heart within the beast.

CAESAR
2
SERVANT
CALPURNIA
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
If he should stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.

CALPURNIA
2
SERVANT
CAESAR
Alas, my lord,
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today. Call it my fear
That keeps you in the house and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,
And he shall say you are not well today.
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

CAESAR
2
SERVANT
CALPURNIA
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.

DECIUS
2
CALPURNIA
CAESAR
Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
I come to fetch you to the Senate House.

CAESAR
2
CALPURNIA
DECIUS
And you are come in very happy time
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come today.
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.

CALPURNIA
2
CAESAR
DECIUS
Say he is sick.

CAESAR
2
CALPURNIA
DECIUS
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

DECIUS
2
CALPURNIA
CAESAR
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.

CAESAR
2
CALPURNIA
DECIUS
The cause is in my will: I will not come,
That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
But, for your private satisfaction,
Because I love you, I will let you know.
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
And evils imminent, and on her knee
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.

DECIUS
1
CAESAR
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate.
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

CAESAR
1
DECIUS
And this way have you well expounded it.

DECIUS
1
CAESAR
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
And know it now, the Senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Apt to be render'd, for someone to say
"Break up the Senate till another time,
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
"Lo, Caesar is afraid"?
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
To your proceeding bids me tell you this,
And reason to my love is liable.

CAESAR
1
DECIUS
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.

PUBLIUS

Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,

As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is't o'clock?

BRUTUS
Bid them prepare within.
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
Remember that you call on me today;
Be near me, that I may remember you.

TREBONIUS

ANTONY
BRUTUS
Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.

Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,
And we like friends will straightway go together.

The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!

"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come
not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark
well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast
wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men,
and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, look
about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods
defend thee!
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

PORTIA

LUCIUS
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?

LUCIUS
1
PORTIA
To know my errand, madam.

PORTIA
1
LUCIUS
I would have had thee there, and here again,
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side!
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?

LUCIUS
1
PORTIA
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?

PORTIA
1
LUCIUS
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth; and take good note
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy, what noise is that?

LUCIUS
1
PORTIA
I hear none, madam.

PORTIA
1
LUCIUS
Prithee, listen well.
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.

LUCIUS

PORTIA
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

Come hither, fellow;
Which way hast thou been?

About the ninth hour, lady.

PORTIA

Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?

SOOTHSAYER
1
PORTIA
Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol.

PORTIA
1
SOOTHSAYER
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?

SOOTHSAYER
1
PORTIA
That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

PORTIA
1
SOOTHSAYER
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?

SOOTHSAYER
1
PORTIA
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place more void and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

PORTIA
0
I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
Say I am merry. Come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

Fare you well.

BRUTUS

POPILIUS
What said Popilius Lena?

CASSIUS

BRUTUS
POPILIUS
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.

BRUTUS

CASSIUS
POPILIUS
Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.

CASSIUS

BRUTUS
DECIUS
Casca,
Be sudden, for we fear prevention.
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
For I will slay myself.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
DECIUS
Cassius, be constant.
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
DECIUS
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

DECIUS

BRUTUS
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

He is address'd; press near and second him.

Are we all ready? What is now amiss
That Caesar and his Senate must redress?

METELLUS

CINNA
CAESAR
BRUTUS
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart.                                     Kneels.

CAESAR
3
CINNA
BRUTUS
METELLUS
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men
And turn preordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,
Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished.
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
Will he be satisfied.

METELLUS
2
CAESAR
BRUTUS
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?

BRUTUS
3
CAESAR
CASSIUS
METELLUS
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

CAESAR

CINNA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
METELLUS
What, Brutus?

CASSIUS

CINNA
CAESAR
BRUTUS
Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

CAESAR

CINNA
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
DECIUS
I could be well moved, if I were as you;
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;
But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;
They are all fire and every one doth shine;
But there's but one in all doth hold his place.
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank,
Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,
Let me a little show it, even in this;
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
And constant do remain to keep him so.

There is no harm intended to your person,
Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.

CASSIUS

And leave us, Publius, lest that the people
Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.

BRUTUS

Do so, and let no man abide this deed
But we the doers.

CASSIUS

TREBONIUS

Where is Antony?

TREBONIUS

CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run
As it were doomsday.

BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
CASSIUS
Fates, we will know your pleasures.
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
And drawing days out that men stand upon.

CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
BRUTUS
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.

BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
CASSIUS
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,
And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
DECIUS
Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
DECIUS
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
No worthier than the dust!

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
DECIUS
So oft as that shall be,
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
The men that gave their country liberty.

DECIUS
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
What, shall we forth?

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
DECIUS
Ay, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

BRUTUS

SERVANT
CASSIUS
DECIUS
Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.

SERVANT
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
Say I love Brutus and I honor him;
Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living, but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.

BRUTUS
2
SERVANT
CASSIUS
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,
Depart untouch'd.

SERVANT
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
I'll fetch him presently.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I know that we shall have him well to friend.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
That fears him much, and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die;
No place will please me so, no means of death,
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
The choice and master spirits of this age.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
O Antony, beg not your death of us!
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
As, by our hands and this our present act
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done.
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome-
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

CASSIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
In the disposing of new dignities.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded.

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
To see thy Antony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,
Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer strucken by many princes
Dost thou here lie!

CASSIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Mark Antony-

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
The enemies of Caesar shall say this:
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

CASSIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
Or else were this a savage spectacle.
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
You should be satisfied.

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
That's all I seek;
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the marketplace,
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
Speak in the order of his funeral.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
You shall, Mark Antony.

CASSIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Brutus, a word with you.
[Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral.
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter?

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
By your pardon,
I will myself into the pulpit first,
And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission,
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

CASSIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
I know not what may fall; I like it not.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
And say you do't by our permission,
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral. And you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Be it so,
I do desire no more.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
Prepare the body then, and follow us.

ANTONY
1
BRUTUS
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.

SERVANT

BRUTUS

Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

He did receive his letters, and is coming,
And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
O Caesar!                                     Sees the body.

ANTONY
1
SERVANT
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?

SERVANT

ANTONY
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.

ANTONY
2
SERVANT
BRUTUS
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the marketplace. There shall I try,
In my oration, how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men,
According to the which thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.                Exeunt with Caesar's body.

respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in your
wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If
there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to
him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his. If
then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is
my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome
more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than
that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I
weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There
is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor,
and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so
rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I
offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If
any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

SECOND CITIZEN
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them,
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-
For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men-
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
But Brutus says he was ambitious,
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
And sure he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.

ANTONY

ALL
FOURTH CITIZEN
THIRD CITIZEN
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters! If I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.
Let but the commons hear this testament-
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.

It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
For if you should, O, what would come of it!

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle. I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii.
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;
See what a rent the envious Casca made;
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart,
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend, and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood. I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.

ANTONY

This is a slight unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it?

OCTAVIUS

ANTONY
LEPIDUS
So you thought him,
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die
In our black sentence and proscription.

ANTONY

OCTAVIUS
Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
And though we lay these honors on this man
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,
Then take we down his load and turn him off,
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
And graze in commons.

OCTAVIUS
1
ANTONY
You may do your will,
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.

ANTONY
1
OCTAVIUS
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
I do appoint him store of provender.
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:
He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
On objects, arts, and imitations,
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers; we must straight make head;
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
And let us presently go sit in council,
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.

OCTAVIUS
1
ANTONY
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
And bay'd about with many enemies;
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
Millions of mischiefs.

In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone; but if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied.

I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honor.

LUCILIUS
PINDARUS
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
How he received you. Let me be resolved.

LUCILIUS

PINDARUS
BRUTUS
With courtesy and with respect enough,
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath used of old.

BRUTUS

LUCILIUS
PINDARUS
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

LUCILIUS
1

They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.                     Low march within.

And when you do them-

Cassius, be content,
Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.

CASSIUS

Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.

BRUTUS

CASSIUS
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear his comment.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Chastisement?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Brutus, bait not me,
I'll not endure it. You forget yourself
To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Go to, you are not, Cassius.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I am.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I say you are not.

CASSIUS

BRUTUS
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Away, slight man!

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Is't possible?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Is it come to this?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say "better"?

BRUTUS

If you did, I care not.

When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

BRUTUS

No.

What, durst not tempt him?

BRUTUS

CASSIUS
For your life you durst not.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,
That they pass by me as the idle wind
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,
For I can raise no money by vile means.
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection. I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dash him to pieces!

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I denied you not.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
You did.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I did not. He was but a fool
That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I do not, till you practise them on me.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
You love me not.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I do not like your faults.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
A friendly eye could never see such faults.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
For Cassius is aweary of the world:
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.
If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Sheathe your dagger.
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,
That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark
And straight is cold again.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
And my heart too.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
O Brutus!

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
What's the matter?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Have not you love enough to bear with me
When that rash humor which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
When you are overearnest with your Brutus,
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

POET

CASSIUS
BRUTUS
[Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
They be alone.

LUCILIUS

CASSIUS
BRUTUS
[Within.] You shall not come to them.

[Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.

LUCILIUS
BRUTUS
How now, what's the matter?

POET

LUCILIUS
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.

CASSIUS

POET
BRUTUS
Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

BRUTUS

POET
CASSIUS
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!

CASSIUS
2
POET
BRUTUS
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us.             Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
I did not think you could have been so angry.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Of your philosophy you make no use,
If you give place to accidental evils.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Ha? Portia?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
She is dead.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Impatient of my absence,
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strong- for with her death
That tidings came- with this she fell distract,
And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
And died so?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Even so.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
O ye immortal gods!

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.              Drinks.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
MESSALA
Portia, art thou gone?

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
With what addition?

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
There in our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
MESSALA
Cicero one!

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
No, Messala.

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
Nothing, Messala.

MESSALA
1
BRUTUS
That, methinks, is strange.

BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?

MESSALA
1
BRUTUS
No, my lord.

BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once
I have the patience to endure it now.

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Even so great men great losses should endure.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
MESSALA
I have as much of this in art as you,
But yet my nature could not bear it so.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently?

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
MESSALA
I do not think it good.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Your reason?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection,
For they have grudged us contribution.
The enemy, marching along by them,
By them shall make a fuller number up,
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
From which advantage shall we cut him off
If at Philippi we do face him there,
These people at our back.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Hear me, good brother.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Under your pardon. You must note beside
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Then, with your will, go on;
We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity,
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
No more. Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Lucius!
My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.
Farewell, good Messala;
Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,
Good night and good repose.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night.
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
TITINIUS
Everything is well.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
TITINIUS
Good night, my lord.

BRUTUS
3
TITINIUS
CASSIUS
LUCIUS
Good night, good brother.

TITINIUS
3
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.

BRUTUS
3
TITINIUS
CASSIUS
LUCIUS
Farewell, everyone.
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

LUCIUS
2
BRUTUS
TITINIUS
Here in the tent.

BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.
Call Claudio and some other of my men,
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
Varro and Claudio!

VARRO
2
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
Calls my lord?

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
LUCIUS
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.

VARRO
2
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
LUCIUS
I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

LUCIUS
2
VARRO
BRUTUS
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
LUCIUS
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
Ay, my lord, an't please you.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
It does, my boy.
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
It is my duty, sir.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
I have slept, my lord, already.

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.

GHOST
2
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

BRUTUS
2
GHOST
LUCIUS
Why comest thou?

GHOST
1
BRUTUS
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

BRUTUS
2
GHOST
LUCIUS
Well, then I shall see thee again?

GHOST
2
BRUTUS
LUCIUS
Ay, at Philippi.

BRUTUS
2
GHOST
LUCIUS
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudio! Sirs, awake!
Claudio!

LUCIUS
2
GHOST
BRUTUS
The strings, my lord, are false.

BRUTUS
2
GHOST
LUCIUS
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake!

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
My lord?

BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

LUCIUS
1
BRUTUS
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
LUCIUS
Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?

LUCIUS
2
VARRO
BRUTUS
Nothing, my lord.

BRUTUS
3
VARRO
CLAUDIO
LUCIUS
Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
[To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!

VARRO
3
BRUTUS
CLAUDIO
LUCIUS
My lord?

CLAUDIO
2
VARRO
BRUTUS
My lord?

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
CLAUDIO
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

VARRO
2
BRUTUS
CLAUDIO
CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
CLAUDIO
Ay, saw you anything?

VARRO
2
BRUTUS
CLAUDIO
No, my lord, I saw nothing.

CLAUDIO
2
VARRO
BRUTUS
Nor I, my lord.

BRUTUS
2
VARRO
CLAUDIO
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
And we will follow.

VARRO
2
BRUTUS
CLAUDIO
CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.

OCTAVIUS
1
ANTONY
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down,
But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so. Their battles are at hand;
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.

ANTONY
1
OCTAVIUS
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it. They could be content
To visit other places, and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But 'tis not so.

MESSENGER
2
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
Prepare you, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show;
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
And something to be done immediately.

ANTONY
2
OCTAVIUS
MESSENGER
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
Upon the left hand of the even field.

OCTAVIUS
2
ANTONY
MESSENGER
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.

ANTONY
2
OCTAVIUS
MESSENGER
Why do you cross me in this exigent?

OCTAVIUS
1
ANTONY
I do not cross you, but I will do so.

BRUTUS
3
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
CASSIUS
They stand, and would have parley.

CASSIUS
3
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.

OCTAVIUS
3
ANTONY
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?

ANTONY
3
OCTAVIUS
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth, the generals would have some words.

OCTAVIUS
3
ANTONY
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Stir not until the signal not until the signal.

BRUTUS
2
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?

OCTAVIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Not that we love words better, as you do.

BRUTUS
3
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
CASSIUS
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

ANTONY
3
OCTAVIUS
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
Crying "Long live! Hail, Caesar!"

CASSIUS
2
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Antony,
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless.

ANTONY
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Not stingless too.

BRUTUS
2
ANTONY
CASSIUS
O, yes, and soundless too,
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
And very wisely threat before you sting.

ANTONY
3
OCTAVIUS
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!

CASSIUS
3
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
This tongue had not offended so today,
If Cassius might have ruled.

OCTAVIUS
3
ANTONY
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Look,
I draw a sword against conspirators;
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged, or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.

BRUTUS
2
OCTAVIUS
CASSIUS
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.

OCTAVIUS
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
So I hope,
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.

BRUTUS
3
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
CASSIUS
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.

CASSIUS
3
OCTAVIUS
ANTONY
BRUTUS
A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
Join'd with a masker and a reveler!

ANTONY
3
OCTAVIUS
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Old Cassius still!

OCTAVIUS
3
ANTONY
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field;
If not, when you have stomachs.

CASSIUS
4
OCTAVIUS
LUCILIUS
ANTONY
BRUTUS
Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

BRUTUS
3
OCTAVIUS
LUCILIUS
CASSIUS
Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.

LUCILIUS
3
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
MESSALA
[Stands forth.] My lord?

CASSIUS
3
LUCILIUS
BRUTUS
MESSALA
Messala!

MESSALA
2
LUCILIUS
CASSIUS
[Stands forth.] What says my general?

CASSIUS
3
LUCILIUS
BRUTUS
MESSALA
Messala,
This is my birthday, as this very day
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.
Be thou my witness that, against my will,
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong,
And his opinion. Now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,
Who to Philippi here consorted us.
This morning are they fled away and gone,
And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
BRUTUS
Believe not so.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
MESSALA
I but believe it partly,
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
MESSALA
Even so, Lucilius.

CASSIUS
2
BRUTUS
MESSALA
Now, most noble Brutus,
The gods today stand friendly that we may,
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
The very last time we shall speak together.
What are you then determined to do?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself- I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
The time of life- arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Then, if we lose this battle,
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome?

BRUTUS
1
CASSIUS
No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun.
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then this parting was well made.

CASSIUS
1
BRUTUS
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

BRUTUS
2
CASSIUS
TITINIUS
Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away!

BRUTUS
0
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.             Loud alarum.
Let them set on at once, for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala. Let them all come down.

CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.
This ensign here of mine was turning back;
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.

TITINIUS
1
CASSIUS
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.

PINDARUS
2
CASSIUS
TITINIUS
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.

CASSIUS
2
PINDARUS
TITINIUS
This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

TITINIUS
2
PINDARUS
CASSIUS
They are, my lord.

CASSIUS
2
PINDARUS
TITINIUS
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again, that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

TITINIUS
2
PINDARUS
CASSIUS
I will be here again, even with a thought.

CASSIUS
1
PINDARUS
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
And tell me what thou notest about the field.
This day I breathed first: time is come round,
And where I did begin, there shall I end;
My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?

PINDARUS
1
CASSIUS
[Above.] O my lord!

CASSIUS
1
PINDARUS
What news?

PINDARUS
1
CASSIUS
[Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
He's ta'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy.

CASSIUS
1
PINDARUS
Come down; behold no more.
O, coward that I am, to live so long,
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
Come hither, sirrah.
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,
That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.                  Dies.

PINDARUS
1
CASSIUS
So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
Where never Roman shall take note of him.

MESSALA
2
CASSIUS
TITINIUS
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.

TITINIUS
1
MESSALA
These tidings would well comfort Cassius.

MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Where did you leave him?

TITINIUS
1
MESSALA
All disconsolate,
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.

MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?

TITINIUS
1
MESSALA
He lies not like the living. O my heart!

MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Is not that he?

TITINIUS
1
MESSALA
No, this was he, Messala,
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.

MESSALA

TITINIUS
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error, melancholy's child,
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!

TITINIUS

MESSALA
What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?

MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
Into his ears. I may say "thrusting" it,
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight.

TITINIUS
1
MESSALA
Hie you, Messala,
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.

O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails.                     Low alarums.

CATO

BRUTUS
Brave Titinius!
Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius!

BRUTUS

CATO
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe moe tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight.

BRUTUS

Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!

CATO

BRUTUS
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

BRUTUS

CATO
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!

LUCILIUS

CATO
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,
And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.

Yield, or thou diest.

LUCILIUS

FIRST SOLDIER
Only I yield to die.
[Offers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:
Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.

FIRST SOLDIER

LUCILIUS
We must not. A noble prisoner!

SECOND SOLDIER

LUCILIUS

Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.

I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.

ANTONY
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.

ANTONY

LUCILIUS
FIRST SOLDIER
This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
Give him all kindness; I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
How everything is chanced.

BRUTUS

CLITUS
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.

CLITUS

BRUTUS
Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.

BRUTUS

CLITUS
Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.        Whispers.

CLITUS

BRUTUS
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.

BRUTUS

Peace then, no words.

Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.

What ill request did Brutus make to thee?

DARDANIUS

To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.

Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.

VOLUMNIUS

CLITUS
BRUTUS
What says my lord?

BRUTUS

CLITUS
VOLUMNIUS
Why, this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
And this last night here in Philippi fields.
I know my hour is come.

VOLUMNIUS
2
CLITUS
BRUTUS
Not so, my lord.

BRUTUS
2
CLITUS
VOLUMNIUS
Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
Our enemies have beat us to the pit;            Low alarums.
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou know'st that we two went to school together;
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.

VOLUMNIUS

CLITUS
BRUTUS
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

VOLUMNIUS
Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.

CLITUS
STRATO
VOLUMNIUS
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day,
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history.
Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest
That have but labor'd to attain this hour.

CLITUS

STRATO
BRUTUS
VOLUMNIUS
Fly, my lord, fly.

BRUTUS

CLITUS
STRATO
Hence! I will follow.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

STRATO

CLITUS
BRUTUS
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.

BRUTUS

CLITUS
STRATO
Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
Caesar, now be still;
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.            Dies.

My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?

STRATO

OCTAVIUS
MESSALA
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
For Brutus only overcame himself,
And no man else hath honor by his death.

LUCILIUS

OCTAVIUS

So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.

Octavius, then take him to follow thee
That did the latest service to my master.

ANTONY

OCTAVIUS
STRATO
MESSALA
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators, save only he,
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
He only, in a general honest thought
And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world, "This was a man!"

OCTAVIUS

ANTONY
MESSALA
According to his virtue let us use him
With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,
Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
So call the field to rest, and let's away,
To part the glories of this happy day.
