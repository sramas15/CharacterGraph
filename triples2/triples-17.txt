KING

DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors- for so you are
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires-
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Berowne, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here.
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein.
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

LONGAVILLE

DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine.
Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

DUMAIN
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,
With all these living in philosophy.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances,
As: not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food,
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then to sleep but three hours in the night
And not be seen to wink of all the day-
When I was wont to think no harm all night,
And make a dark night too of half the day-
Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

KING
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your Grace,
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
KING
You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study, let me know.

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Why, that to know which else we should not know.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

KING
1
BEROWNE
Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.

BEROWNE
1
KING
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know,
As thus: to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,
Study to break it, and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus, and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
These be the stops that hinder study quite,
And train our intellects to vain delight.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
KING
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,
As painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed,
By fixing it upon a fairer eye;
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;
Small have continual plodders ever won,
Save base authority from others' books.
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.

KING

DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
How well he's read, to reason against reading!

DUMAIN
3
KING
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
How follows that?

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
In reason nothing.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Something then in rhyme.

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
KING
Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows;
But like of each thing that in season grows;
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore,
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name.

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
[Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of
my court'- Hath this been proclaimed?

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
KING
Four days ago.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her
tongue.' Who devis'd this penalty?

LONGAVILLE
1
BEROWNE
Marry, that did I.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
Sweet lord, and why?

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
KING
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
A dangerous law against gentility.
[Reads] 'Item. If any man be seen to talk with a woman within
the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the
rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter, with yourself to speak-
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father;
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes th' admired princess hither.

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
So study evermore is over-shot.
While it doth study to have what it would,
It doth forget to do the thing it should;
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.

KING
1
BEROWNE
We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might mast'red, but by special grace.
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:
I am forsworn on mere necessity.
So to the laws at large I write my name;        [Subscribes]
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain,
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One who the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate,
In high-born words, the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But I protest I love to hear him lie,
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
KING
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study three years is but short.

DULL
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Which is the Duke's own person?

BEROWNE
2
DULL
LONGAVILLE
This, fellow. What wouldst?

DULL
3
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
COSTARD
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's
farborough; but I would see his own person in flesh and blood.

BEROWNE
2
COSTARD
DULL
This is he.

DULL
3
BEROWNE
COSTARD
KING
Signior Arme- Arme- commends you. There's villainy abroad;
this letter will tell you more.

COSTARD
3
BEROWNE
DULL
KING
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.

KING
4
COSTARD
BEROWNE
DULL
LONGAVILLE
A letter from the magnificent Armado.

BEROWNE
3
KING
COSTARD
LONGAVILLE
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
KING
A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!

BEROWNE
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
COSTARD
To hear, or forbear hearing?

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
COSTARD
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to
forbear both.

BEROWNE
2
COSTARD
LONGAVILLE
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
in the merriness.

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BEROWNE
2
COSTARD
LONGAVILLE
In what manner?

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
KING
In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was
seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form,
and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is in
manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner- it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form- in some form.

BEROWNE
2
COSTARD
KING
For the following, sir?

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
KING
As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the
right!

KING
2
COSTARD
BEROWNE
Will you hear this letter with attention?

BEROWNE
2
KING
COSTARD
As we would hear an oracle.

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
KING
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

KING
2
COSTARD
BEROWNE
[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole
dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god and body's fost'ring
patron'-

COSTARD
2
KING
BEROWNE
Not a word of Costard yet.

KING
1
COSTARD
[Reads] 'So it is'-

COSTARD
1
KING
It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling
true, but so.

KING
1
COSTARD
Peace!

COSTARD
1
KING
Be to me, and every man that dares not fight!

KING
1
COSTARD
No words!

COSTARD
1
KING
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

KING
1
COSTARD
[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I
did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome
physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook
myself to walk. The time When? About the sixth hour; when beasts
most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment
which is called supper. So much for the time When. Now for the
ground Which? which, I mean, I upon; it is ycleped thy park. Then
for the place Where? where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene
and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow-white pen
the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest, beholdest,
surveyest, or seest. But to the place Where? It standeth
north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy
curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain,
that base minnow of thy mirth,'

COSTARD
1
KING
Me?

KING
1
COSTARD
'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'

COSTARD
1
KING
Me?

KING
1
COSTARD
'that shallow vassal,'

COSTARD
1
KING
Still me?

KING
1
COSTARD
'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'

COSTARD
2
KING
DULL
O, me!

KING
2
COSTARD
DULL
'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed
edict and continent canon; which, with, O, with- but with this I
passion to say wherewith-'

COSTARD
2
KING
DULL
With a wench.
King. 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy
more sweet understanding, a woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed
duty pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet Grace's officer, Antony Dull, a man of
good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.'

DULL
3
COSTARD
KING
BEROWNE
Me, an't shall please you; I am Antony Dull.

KING
3
COSTARD
DULL
BEROWNE
'For Jaquenetta- so is the weaker vessel called, which I
apprehended with the aforesaid swain- I keep her as a vessel of
thy law's fury; and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice,
bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and
heart-burning heat of duty, DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

BEROWNE
3
KING
DULL
COSTARD
This is not so well as I look'd for, but the best that
ever I heard.

KING
3
BEROWNE
DULL
COSTARD
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to
this?

COSTARD
2
KING
BEROWNE
Sir, I confess the wench.

KING
2
COSTARD
BEROWNE
Did you hear the proclamation?

COSTARD
1
KING
I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
marking of it.

KING
1
COSTARD
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a
wench.

COSTARD
1
KING
I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.

KING
1
COSTARD
Well, it was proclaimed damsel.

COSTARD
1
KING
This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.

KING
1
COSTARD
It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.

COSTARD
1
KING
If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.

KING
1
COSTARD
This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir.

COSTARD
1
KING
This maid will serve my turn, sir.

KING
2
COSTARD
BEROWNE
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week
with bran and water.

COSTARD
2
KING
BEROWNE
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

KING
2
COSTARD
BEROWNE
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o'er;
And go we, lords, to put in practice that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.

BEROWNE
2
KING
COSTARD
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
KING
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken
with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore
welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile
again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
melancholy?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, no; O Lord, sir, no!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender
juvenal?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Why tough signior? Why tough signior?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old
time, which we may name tough.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Pretty and apt.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and
my saying pretty?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Thou pretty, because little.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
And therefore apt, because quick.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Speak you this in my praise, master?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
In thy condign praise.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I will praise an eel with the same praise.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
that an eel is ingenious?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
That an eel is quick.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I am answer'd, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I love not to be cross'd.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I have promised to study three years with the Duke.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You may do it in an hour, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Impossible.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
How many is one thrice told?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete
man.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
amounts to.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
It doth amount to one more than two.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Which the base vulgar do call three.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
True.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three
studied ere ye'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years'
to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the
dancing horse will tell you.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
A most fine figure!

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] To prove you a cipher.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing
my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy. I
think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort
me, boy; what great men have been in love?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Hercules, master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;
and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a
porter; and he was in love.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in
love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A woman, master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Of what complexion?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the
four.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Tell me precisely of what complexion.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Of the sea-water green, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Is that one of the four complexions?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He
surely affected her for her wit.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
My love is most immaculate white and red.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such
colours.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Define, define, well-educated infant.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!

MOTH
1
ARMADO
If she be made of white and red,
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or if it were, it
would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love
that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind
Costard; she deserves well.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I say, sing.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Forbear till this company be past.

DULL
3
MOTH
JAQUENETTA
ARMADO
Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and
you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a
must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at
the park; she is allow'd for the day-woman. Fare you well.

ARMADO
3
MOTH
JAQUENETTA
DULL
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

JAQUENETTA
2
DULL
ARMADO
Man!

ARMADO
2
JAQUENETTA
DULL
I will visit thee at the lodge.

JAQUENETTA
1
ARMADO
That's hereby.

ARMADO
1
JAQUENETTA
I know where it is situate.

JAQUENETTA
1
ARMADO
Lord, how wise you are!

ARMADO
1
JAQUENETTA
I will tell thee wonders.

JAQUENETTA
1
ARMADO
With that face?

ARMADO
1
JAQUENETTA
I love thee.

JAQUENETTA
2
DULL
ARMADO
So I heard you say.

ARMADO
2
JAQUENETTA
DULL
And so, farewell.

JAQUENETTA
2
DULL
ARMADO
Fair weather after you!

DULL
3
JAQUENETTA
COSTARD
ARMADO
Come, Jaquenetta, away.

ARMADO
2
COSTARD
DULL
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
pardoned.

COSTARD
2
DULL
ARMADO
Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full
stomach.

ARMADO
3
MOTH
COSTARD
DULL
Thou shalt be heavily punished.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but
lightly rewarded.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
Take away this villain; shut him up.

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
Come, you transgressing slave, away.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
No, sir; that were fast, and loose. Thou shalt to prison.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I
have seen, some shall see.

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
What shall some see?

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is
not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore
I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as
another man, and therefore I can be quiet.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread.
I shall be forsworn- which is a great argument of falsehood- if I
love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted?
Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but
Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent
strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club, and therefore
too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second cause
will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello
he regards not; his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory
is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum;
for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me, some
extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.
Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

BOYET
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits.
Consider who the King your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear,
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
FIRST LORD
Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.
Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
Not utt'red by base sale of chapmen's tongues;
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court.
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his Grace.
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visag'd suitors, his high will.

BOYET

FIRST LORD
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Proud of employment, willingly I go.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
FIRST LORD
MARIA
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

FIRST LORD

BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Lord Longaville is one.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
FIRST LORD
MARIA
Know you the man?

MARIA
2
FIRST LORD
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I know him, madam; at a marriage feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms;
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will,
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
FIRST LORD

Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

They say so most that most his humours know.

ROSALINE
MARIA
Such short-liv'd wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?

KATHARINE
3
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
MARIA
The young Dumain, a well-accomplish'd youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved;
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.

ROSALINE
3
KATHARINE
FIRST LORD
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Berowne they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal.
His eye begets occasion for his wit,
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales,
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Here comes Boyet.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
FIRST LORD
ROSALINE
Now, what admittance, lord?

BOYET
2
FIRST LORD
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.

KING
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
KING
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I
have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and
welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

KING
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
I will be welcome then; conduct me thither.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath-

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
Why, will shall break it; will, and nothing
else.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
BEROWNE
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your Grace hath sworn out house-keeping.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me, I am too sudden bold;
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.         [Giving a paper]

KING
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
KING

YOU Will the sooner that I were away,
For you'll prove perjur'd if you make me stay.

Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

KATHARINE

BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

BEROWNE

KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I know you did.

KATHARINE

BEROWNE
How needless was it then to ask the question!

BEROWNE
1
KATHARINE
You must not be so quick.

KATHARINE
1
BEROWNE
'Tis long of you, that spur me with such questions.

BEROWNE

Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

KATHARINE

Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

KATHARINE
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Nay, then will I be gone.

KING

KATHARINE
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the King your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal,
And have the money by our father lent,
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
And go well satisfied to France again.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
BEROWNE
You do the King my father too much wrong,
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

KING
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I do protest I never heard of it;
And, if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
KING
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.

KING
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Satisfy me so.

BOYET
2
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
So please your Grace, the packet is not come,
Where that and other specialties are bound;
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

KING
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
It shall suffice me; at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour, without breach of honour, may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
You may not come, fair Princess, within my gates;
But here without you shall be so receiv'd
As you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.
To-morrow shall we visit you again.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Alack, let it blood.

Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

BOYET

DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

DUMAIN

BOYET
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.

LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

BOYET
1
LONGAVILLE
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

BOYET
1
LONGAVILLE
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

BOYET
1
LONGAVILLE
Her mother's, I have heard.

LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
God's blessing on your beard!

BOYET
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Good sir, be not offended;
She is an heir of Falconbridge.

LONGAVILLE
2
BOYET
BEROWNE
Nay, my choler is ended.
She is a most sweet lady.

BOYET
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Not unlike, sir; that may be.

BEROWNE
1
BOYET
What's her name in the cap?

BOYET
1
BEROWNE
Rosaline, by good hap.

BEROWNE
1
BOYET
Is she wedded or no?

BOYET
2
BEROWNE
MARIA
To her will, sir, or so.

BEROWNE
2
BOYET
MARIA
You are welcome, sir; adieu!

BOYET
3
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

MARIA
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;
Not a word with him but a jest.

BOYET
4
KATHARINE
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
And every jest but a word.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
BOYET
KATHARINE
MARIA
It was well done of you to take him at his
word.

BOYET

KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

KATHARINE
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Two hot sheeps, marry!

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

KATHARINE
1
BOYET
You sheep and I pasture- shall that finish the jest?

BOYET
1
KATHARINE
So you grant pasture for me.     [Offering to kiss her]

KATHARINE
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Not so, gentle beast;
My lips are no common, though several they be.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Belonging to whom?

KATHARINE
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
To my fortunes and me.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
BOYET
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abused.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
KATHARINE
With what?

BOYET
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BOYET
Your reason?

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.
His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed;
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair.
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd.
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
MARIA
Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.

BOYET
3
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd;
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

MARIA
4
BOYET
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.

KATHARINE
3
BOYET
ROSALINE
MARIA
He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.

ROSALINE
3
KATHARINE
BOYET
MARIA
Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but
grim.

BOYET
3
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Do you hear, my mad wenches?

MARIA
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
No.

BOYET
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
What, then; do you see?

MARIA
1
BOYET
Ay, our way to be gone.

BOYET
1
MARIA
You are too hard for me.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give
enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must
employ him in a letter to my love.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How meanest thou? Brawling in French?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your
eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the
throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime
through the nose, as if you snuff'd up love by smelling love,
with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes, with
your arms cross'd on your thin-belly doublet, like a rabbit on a
spit, or your hands in your pocket, like a man after the old
painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these betray nice
wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men
of note- do you note me?- that most are affected to these.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How hast thou purchased this experience?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
By my penny of observation.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
But O- but O-

MOTH
1
ARMADO
The hobby-horse is forgot.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love
perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Almost I had.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Negligent student! learn her by heart.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
By heart and in heart, boy.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
What wilt thou prove?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
instant. By heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by
her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with
her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I am all these three.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an
ass.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Ha, ha, what sayest thou?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
very slow-gaited. But I go.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The way is but short; away.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
As swift as lead, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I say lead is slow.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he;
I shoot thee at the swain.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Thump, then, and I flee.

ARMADO
0
A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face;
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain; no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no
salve, sir, but a plantain!

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous
smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take
salve for l'envoy, and the word 'l'envoy' for a salve?

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
Until the goose came out of door,
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my l'envoy.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
Until the goose came out of door,

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose;
Let me see: a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
Till there be more matter in the shin.

ARMADO
1
COSTARD
Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD
1
ARMADO
O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
goose, in this.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured, restrained,
captivated, bound.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
loose.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: bear this
significant [giving a letter] to the country maid Jaquenetta;
there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honour is
rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

MOTH
1
COSTARD
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
My sweet ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the
Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.
'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give
you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of
this word.

BEROWNE
2
MOTH
COSTARD
My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met!

COSTARD
2
MOTH
BEROWNE
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for
a remuneration?

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
What is a remuneration?

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
I thank your worship. God be wi' you!

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
Stay, slave; I must employ thee.
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
When would you have it done, sir?

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
This afternoon.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
Well, I will do it, sir; fare you well.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
Thou knowest not what it is.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
Why, villain, thou must know first.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
It must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration; a
'leven-pence farthing better; most sweet gardon! I will do it,
sir, in print. Gardon- remuneration!

And I, forsooth, in love; I, that have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
Th' anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator, and great general
Of trotting paritors. O my little heart!
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What! I love, I sue, I seek a wife-
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjur'd, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed,
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan:
Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.

Was that the King that spurr'd his horse so
Against the steep uprising of the hill?

BOYET

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
FORESTER
I know not; but I think it was not he.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
FORESTER
Whoe'er 'a was, 'a show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch;
On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in?

FORESTER
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
FORESTER
I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.

FORESTER
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
FORESTER
What, what? First praise me, and again say no?
O short-liv'd pride! Not fair? Alack for woe!

FORESTER
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Yes, madam, fair.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
FORESTER
Nay, never paint me now;
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

FORESTER
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
FORESTER
See, see, my beauty will be sav'd by merit.
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
But come, the bow. Now mercy goes to kill,
And shooting well is then accounted ill;
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
And, out of question, so it is sometimes:
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
We bend to that the working of the heart;
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill.

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
FORESTER
Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
FORESTER
Only for praise; and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord.

The thickest and the tallest! It is so; truth is truth.

Are not you the chief woman? You are the thickest here.

Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve.

[Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible;
true that thou art beauteous; truth itself that thou art lovely.
More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth
itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal. The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the
pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon; and he it was that
might rightly say, 'Veni, vidi, vici'; which to annothanize in
the vulgar,- O base and obscure vulgar!- videlicet, He came, saw,
and overcame. He came, one; saw, two; overcame, three. Who came?-
the king. Why did he come?- to see. Why did he see?-to overcome.
To whom came he?- to the beggar. What saw he?- the beggar. Who
overcame he?- the beggar. The conclusion is victory; on whose
side?- the king's. The captive is enrich'd; on whose side?- the
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial; on whose side?- the
king's. No, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so
stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy
lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy
love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou
exchange for rags?- robes, for tittles?- titles, for thyself?
-me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my
eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part.
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey;
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play.
But if thou strive, poor soul, what are thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.'

O' my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar wit!
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it were, so fit.
Armado a th' t'one side- O, a most dainty man!
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
To see him kiss his hand, and how most sweetly 'a will swear!
And his page a t' other side, that handful of wit!
Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
Sola, sola!

The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as

Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.

DULL

'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES

DULL
NATHANIEL
Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,

replication, or rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his

unpruned, untrained, or rather unlettered, or ratherest
unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my haud credo for a deer.

I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in

The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,

Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please

I Will something affect the letter, for it argues

The preyful Princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing
Some say a sore; but not a sore till now made sore with shooting.
The dogs did yell; put el to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket-
Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores o' sorel.
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.

HOLOFERNES

This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish
extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects,
ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in
the ventricle of memory, nourish'd in the womb of pia mater, and
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in
those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.

If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire.
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,

You find not the apostrophas, and so miss the accent:

smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of
invention? Imitari is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the
ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,

desired employment, Berowne.' Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one
of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a letter
to a sequent of the stranger queen's which accidentally, or by

proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and

Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.

BEROWNE

LONGAVILLE
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

DUMAIN

BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
KING
[Reads]
This will I send; and something else more plain
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
O, would the King, Berowne and Longaville,
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
Would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note;
For none offend where all alike do dote.

LONGAVILLE

DUMAIN
BEROWNE
KING
[Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity,
That in love's grief desir'st society;
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.

KING
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his, your case is such.
You chide at him, offending twice as much:
You do not love Maria! Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile;
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom, to keep down his heart.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.
I heard your guilty rhymes, observ'd your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.
'Ay me!' says one. 'O Jove!' the other cries.
One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other's eyes.
[To LONGAVILLE] You would for paradise break faith and troth;
[To Dumain] And Jove for your love would infringe an oath.
What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
Faith infringed which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
[Descending] Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy,
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me.
Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjur'd; 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting.
But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the King your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of fool'ry have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!
O, me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? All about the breast.
A caudle, ho!

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?

BEROWNE
1
KING
Not you by me, but I betrayed to you.
I that am honest, I that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betrayed by keeping company
With men like you, men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for Joan? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb-

KING
1
BEROWNE
Soft! whither away so fast?
A true man or a thief that gallops so?

BEROWNE

KING
I post from love; good lover, let me go.

Some certain treason.

KING

What makes treason here?

COSTARD

JAQUENETTA

Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

KING

JAQUENETTA

If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.

JAQUENETTA

I beseech your Grace, let this letter be read;
Our person misdoubts it: 'twas treason, he said.

It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear

DUMAIN

BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
KING
It is Berowne's writing, and here is his name.

BEROWNE

DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
[ To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead, you were born
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
What?

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
COSTARD
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess;
He, he, and you- and you, my liege!- and I
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
DUMAIN. Now the number is even.

BEROWNE

DUMAIN
KING
COSTARD
True, true, we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?

KING

BEROWNE
COSTARD
Hence, sirs, away.

COSTARD

KING
BEROWNE
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.

BEROWNE
2
COSTARD
KING
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be.
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree.
We cannot cross the cause why we were born,
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

KING
2
BEROWNE
COSTARD
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

BEROWNE
2
KING
COSTARD
'Did they?' quoth you. Who sees the heavenly Rosaline
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde
At the first op'ning of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and, strucken blind,
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow
That is not blinded by her majesty?

KING
1
BEROWNE
What zeal, what fury hath inspir'd thee now?
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
She, an attending star, scarce seen a light.

BEROWNE
1
KING
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues-
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not!
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs:
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye.
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy.
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine!

KING
1
BEROWNE
By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
KING
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? Where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look.
No face is fair that is not full so black.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons, and the school of night;
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deckt,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days;
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red that would avoid dispraise
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

DUMAIN
3
BEROWNE
KING
LONGAVILLE
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
KING
And since her time are colliers counted bright.

KING
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

DUMAIN

KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
KING
Your mistresses dare never come in rain
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
'Twere good yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
KING
I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

KING
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

DUMAIN

KING
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

LONGAVILLE

DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

DUMAIN
3
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
KING
O vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
But what of this? Are we not all in love?

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
KING
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

KING
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Then leave this chat; and, good Berowne, now prove
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

DUMAIN
3
KING
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
O, some authority how to proceed;
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil!

DUMAIN
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Some salve for perjury.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men-at-arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto:
To fast, to study, and to see no woman-
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream, and pore, and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They are the ground, the books, the academes,
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,
And where we are our learning likewise is;
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
With ourselves.
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain,
But with the motion of all elements
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye:
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd.
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails:
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair.
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain, and nourish, all the world,
Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear;
Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love;
Or for Love's sake, a word that loves all men;
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men-
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn;
For charity itself fulfils the law,
And who can sever love from charity?

KING
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!

BEROWNE

DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! be first advis'd,
In conflict, that you get the sun of them.

LONGAVILLE
2
BEROWNE
KING
Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by.
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
And win them too; therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.

BEROWNE
2
KING
LONGAVILLE
First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress. In the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks, and merry hours,
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

KING
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Away, away! No time shall be omitted
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.

BEROWNE
1
KING
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn,
And justice always whirls in equal measure.
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

HOLOFERNES

NATHANIEL
Satis quod sufficit.

NATHANIEL
1
HOLOFERNES
I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have
been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty
without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without
opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam
day with a companion of the King's who is intituled, nominated,
or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

HOLOFERNES
1
NATHANIEL
Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his
gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and
thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd,
as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

NATHANIEL
1
HOLOFERNES
A most singular and choice epithet.

HOLOFERNES
1
NATHANIEL
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than
the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes,
such insociable and point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak 'dout' fine, when he should say 'doubt';
'det' when he should pronounce 'debt'- d, e, b, t, not d, e, t.
He clepeth a calf 'cauf,' half 'hauf'; neighbour vocatur
'nebour'; 'neigh' abbreviated 'ne.' This is abhominable- which he
would call 'abbominable.' It insinuateth me of insanie: ne
intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.

NATHANIEL
1
HOLOFERNES
Laus Deo, bone intelligo.

HOLOFERNES
1
NATHANIEL
'Bone'?- 'bone' for 'bene.' Priscian a little
scratch'd; 'twill serve.

O, they have liv'd long on the alms-basket of words. I
marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word, for thou are

Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a, b, spelt

The third of the five vowels, if You repeat them; or the

I will repeat them: a, e, I-

The sheep; the other two concludes it: o, U.

Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch,
a quick venue of wit- snip, snap, quick and home. It rejoiceth my

An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it
to buy ginger-bread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had
of thy master, thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of

my bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me! Go to;
thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.

At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.

I do, sans question.

ARMADO

Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to
congratulate the Princess at her pavilion, in the posteriors of
this day; which the rude multitude call the afternoon.

HOLOFERNES
2
NATHANIEL
ARMADO
The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable,
congruent, and measurable, for the afternoon. The word is well
cull'd, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.

ARMADO
2
HOLOFERNES
NATHANIEL
Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do
assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let
it pass. I do beseech thee, remember thy courtesy. I beseech
thee, apparel thy head. And among other importunate and most
serious designs, and of great import indeed, too- but let that
pass; for I must tell thee it will please his Grace, by the
world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal
finger thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio; but,
sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable:
some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart
to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world;
but let that pass. The very all of all is- but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy- that the King would have me present the
Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show,
or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden
breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal,
to the end to crave your assistance.

HOLOFERNES
2
NATHANIEL
ARMADO
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
show in the posterior of this day, to be rend'red by our
assistance, the King's command, and this most gallant,
illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess- I say
none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.

NATHANIEL
2
HOLOFERNES
ARMADO
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?

HOLOFERNES
3
MOTH
NATHANIEL
ARMADO
Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant
gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.

ARMADO
3
MOTH
HOLOFERNES
NATHANIEL
Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for that
Worthy's thumb; he is not so big as the end of his club.

HOLOFERNES
3
MOTH
NATHANIEL
ARMADO
Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I
will have an apology for that purpose.

MOTH
2
HOLOFERNES
ARMADO
An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may
cry 'Well done, Hercules; now thou crushest the snake!' That is
the way to make an offence gracious, though few have the grace to
do it.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
HOLOFERNES
For the rest of the Worthies?

HOLOFERNES
2
MOTH
ARMADO
I will play three myself.

Allons! we will employ thee.

Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in.
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving King.

ROSALINE

KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Madam, came nothing else along with that?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

ROSALINE

KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
That was the way to make his godhead wax;
For he hath been five thousand year a boy.

ROSALINE

KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.

KATHARINE
1
ROSALINE
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
And so she died. Had she been light, like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might 'a been a grandam ere she died.
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.

ROSALINE
1
KATHARINE
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

KATHARINE
1
ROSALINE
A light condition in a beauty dark.

ROSALINE
1
KATHARINE
We need more light to find your meaning out.

KATHARINE
1
ROSALINE
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

ROSALINE
1
KATHARINE
Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.

KATHARINE
1
ROSALINE
So do not you; for you are a light wench.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.

ROSALINE

Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But, Rosaline, you have a favour too?
Who sent it? and what is it?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I would you knew.
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
My favour were as great: be witness this.
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;
The numbers true, and, were the numb'ring too,
I were the fairest goddess on the ground.
I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs.
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Anything like?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.

KATHARINE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O that your face were not so full of O's!

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
Dumain?

KATHARINE
3
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Madam, this glove.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Did he not send you twain?

KATHARINE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Yes, madam; and, moreover,
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover;
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compil'd, profound simplicity.

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
The letter is too long by half a mile.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?

MARIA
3
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

ROSALINE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Berowne I'll torture ere I go.
O that I knew he were but in by th' week!
How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,
And wait the season, and observe the times,
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,
And shape his service wholly to my hests,
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So pertaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool, and I his fate.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
None are so surely caught, when they are
As wit turn'd fool; folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school,
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

ROSALINE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

MARIA
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
BOYET
ROSALINE
MARIA
Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her Grace?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
MARIA
Thy news, Boyet?

BOYET
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are
Against your peace. Love doth approach disguis'd,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surpris'd.
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BOYET
Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.

BOYET
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo, to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The King and his companions; warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear-
That, by and by, disguis'd they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage.
Action and accent did they teach him there:
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out;
'For' quoth the King 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that all laugh'd, and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
One rubb'd his elbow, thus, and fleer'd, and swore
A better speech was never spoke before.
Another with his finger and his thumb
Cried 'Via! we will do't, come what will come.'
The third he caper'd, and cried 'All goes well.'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
But what, but what, come they to visit us?

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parley, court, and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress; which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
BOYET
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the King will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.
And change you favours too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceiv'd by these removes.

ROSALINE
3
BOYET
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
But, in this changing, what is your intent?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KATHARINE
BOYET
ROSALINE
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
They do it but in mocking merriment,
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet
With visages display'd to talk and greet.

ROSALINE
3
KATHARINE
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KATHARINE
BOYET
ROSALINE
No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out.
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own;
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they well mock'd depart away with shame.

BOYET
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.

MOTH
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!

BOYET
2
MOTH
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

MOTH
1
BOYET
A holy parcel of the fairest dames
That ever turn'd their- backs- to mortal views!

BEROWNE
2
MOTH
BOYET
Their eyes, villain, their eyes.

MOTH
2
BOYET
BEROWNE
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!
Out-

BOYET
2
MOTH
BEROWNE
True; out indeed.

MOTH
2
BOYET
BEROWNE
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
Not to behold-

BEROWNE
2
MOTH
BOYET
Once to behold, rogue.

MOTH
2
BOYET
BEROWNE
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
sun-beamed eyes-

BOYET
2
MOTH
BEROWNE
They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

MOTH
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.

BEROWNE
3
MOTH
BOYET
ROSALINE
Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.

ROSALINE
3
MOTH
BEROWNE
BOYET
What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will
That some plain man recount their purposes.
Know what they would.

BOYET
2
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
What would you with the Princess?

BEROWNE
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE
2
BOYET
BEROWNE
What would they, say they?

BOYET
3
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
KING
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
KING
Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

BOYET
2
KING
ROSALINE
She says you have it, and you may be gone.

KING
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
Say to her we have measur'd many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass.

BOYET
3
KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
They say that they have measur'd many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.

ROSALINE
3
BOYET
KING
BEROWNE
It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile? If they have measured many,
The measure, then, of one is eas'ly told.

BOYET
3
KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
And many miles, the Princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.

BEROWNE
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
Tell her we measure them by weary steps.

BOYET
2
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
She hears herself.

ROSALINE
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
KING
How many weary steps
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone
Are numb'red in the travel of one mile?

BEROWNE
3
BOYET
KING
ROSALINE
We number nothing that we spend for you;
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.

ROSALINE
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
KING
My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

KING
2
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

ROSALINE
2
KING
BEROWNE
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now requests but moonshine in the water.

KING
1
ROSALINE
Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg; this begging is not strange.

ROSALINE
1
KING
Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.

KING
1
ROSALINE
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

ROSALINE
1
KING
You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.

KING
1
ROSALINE
Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

ROSALINE
1
KING
Our ears vouchsafe it.

KING
1
ROSALINE
But your legs should do it.

ROSALINE
1
KING
Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
We'll not be nice; take hands. We will not dance.

KING
1
ROSALINE
Why take we hands then?

ROSALINE
1
KING
Only to part friends.
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

KING
1
ROSALINE
More measure of this measure; be not nice.

ROSALINE
1
KING
We can afford no more at such a price.

KING
1
ROSALINE
Price you yourselves. What buys your company?

ROSALINE
1
KING
Your absence only.

KING
1
ROSALINE
That can never be.

ROSALINE
1
KING
Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
Twice to your visor and half once to you.

KING
2
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

ROSALINE
2
KING
BEROWNE
In private then.

KING
3
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]

BEROWNE
3
KING
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BEROWNE
KING
Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

BEROWNE
2
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey; well run dice!
There's half a dozen sweets.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BEROWNE
Seventh sweet, adieu!
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

BEROWNE
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
One word in secret.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BEROWNE
Let it not be sweet.

BEROWNE
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Thou grievest my gall.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BEROWNE
Gall! bitter.

BEROWNE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Therefore meet.                 [They converse apart]

DUMAIN
3
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

MARIA
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
Name it.

DUMAIN
3
KATHARINE
BEROWNE
MARIA
Fair lady-

MARIA
2
DUMAIN
KATHARINE
Say you so? Fair lord-
Take that for your fair lady.

DUMAIN
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.

KATHARINE
2
DUMAIN
MARIA
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
DUMAIN
I know the reason, lady, why you ask.

KATHARINE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.

LONGAVILLE
1
KATHARINE
You have a double tongue within your mask,
And would afford my speechless vizard half.

KATHARINE
1
LONGAVILLE
'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?

LONGAVILLE
1
KATHARINE
A calf, fair lady!

KATHARINE
1
LONGAVILLE
No, a fair lord calf.

LONGAVILLE
1
KATHARINE
Let's part the word.

KATHARINE
1
LONGAVILLE
No, I'll not be your half.
Take all and wean it; it may prove an ox.

LONGAVILLE
1
KATHARINE
Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so.

KATHARINE
2
BOYET
LONGAVILLE
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
BOYET
One word in private with you ere I die.

KATHARINE
3
BOYET
ROSALINE
LONGAVILLE
Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.

BOYET
4
KATHARINE
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
LONGAVILLE
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings,
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

ROSALINE
4
BOYET
KATHARINE
BEROWNE
KING
Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

BEROWNE
4
BOYET
KING
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

KING
4
BOYET
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
4
BOYET
KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?

BOYET
3
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

ROSALINE
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
BOYET
ROSALINE
MARIA
O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves to-night?
Or ever but in vizards show their faces?
This pert Berowne was out of count'nance quite.

ROSALINE
3
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
They were all in lamentable cases!
The King was weeping-ripe for a good word.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.

MARIA
3
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
'No point' quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

KATHARINE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
And trow you what he call'd me?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Qualm, perhaps.

KATHARINE
3
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Yes, in good faith.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Go, sickness as thou art!

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
But will you hear? The King is my love sworn.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.

KATHARINE
4
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
MARIA
And Longaville was for my service born.

MARIA
3
KATHARINE
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

BOYET
3
KATHARINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
MARIA
Will they return?

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows;
Therefore, change favours; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.

BOYET
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BOYET
ROSALINE
Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
If they return in their own shapes to woo?

ROSALINE
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,
Let's mock them still, as well known as disguis'd.
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
Disguis'd like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
And wonder what they were, and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd,
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
Should be presented at our tent to us.

BOYET
3
KING
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
BOYET
KING
ROSALINE
Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

KING
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?

BOYET
3
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
BEROWNE
Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
Command me any service to her thither?

KING
3
BOYET
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

BOYET
2
KING
BEROWNE
I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.

BEROWNE
1
KING
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
And utters it again when God doth please.
He is wit's pedlar, and retails his wares
At wakes, and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.
'A can carve too, and lisp; why this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms; nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.
This is the flow'r that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whales-bone;
And consciences that will not die in debt
Pay him the due of 'honey-tongued Boyet.'

KING
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
That put Armado's page out of his part!

BEROWNE
3
BOYET
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
Till this man show'd thee? And what art thou now?

KING
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
BEROWNE
'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

KING
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Construe my speeches better, if you may.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
We came to visit you, and purpose now
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjur'd men.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
You nickname virtue: vice you should have
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
A world of torments though I should endure,
I would not yield to be your house's guest;
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
O, you have liv'd in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
ROSALINE
Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
We have had pastimes here, and pleasant game;
A mess of Russians left us but of late.

KING
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
How, madam! Russians!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
Ay, in truth, my lord;
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

ROSALINE
3
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
BEROWNE
Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit; here they stayed an hour
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

BEROWNE
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish; when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light; your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

ROSALINE
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-

BEROWNE
1
ROSALINE
I am a fool, and full of poverty.

ROSALINE
1
BEROWNE
But that you take what doth to you belong,
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

BEROWNE
1
ROSALINE
O, I am yours, and all that I possess.

ROSALINE
1
BEROWNE
All the fool mine?

BEROWNE
1
ROSALINE
I cannot give you less.

ROSALINE
2
BEROWNE
KING
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

BEROWNE
2
KING
ROSALINE
Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?

ROSALINE
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
KING
There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

KING
4
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.

DUMAIN
3
KING
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
4
DUMAIN
KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?

ROSALINE
3
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

BEROWNE
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I, lady- dart thy skill at me,
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song.
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical- these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!-
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas, and honest kersey noes.
And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

ROSALINE

BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Sans 'sans,' I pray you.

BEROWNE
2
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see-
Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

BEROWNE
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.

ROSALINE
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
It is not so; for how can this be true,
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

BEROWNE
3
KING
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Peace; for I will not have to do with you.

ROSALINE
2
BEROWNE
KING
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

BEROWNE
3
KING
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

KING
3
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
BEROWNE
The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now, disguis'd?

KING
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Madam, I was.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
And were you well advis'd?

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I was, fair madam.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
When you then were here,
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
That more than all the world I did respect her.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
When she shall challenge this, you will reject
her.

KING
1
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Upon mine honour, no.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
ROSALINE
Peace, peace, forbear;
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

KING
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
Despise me when I break this oath of mine.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
ROSALINE
I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

ROSALINE
2
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight, and did value me
Above this world; adding thereto, moreover,
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
ROSALINE
God give thee joy of him! The noble lord

KING
2
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,
I never swore this lady such an oath.

ROSALINE
2
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,
You gave me this; but take it, sir, again.

KING
3
BOYET
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
My faith and this the Princess I did give;
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
4
BOYET
KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd,
Told our intents before; which once disclos'd,
The ladies did change favours; and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn in will and error.
Much upon this it is; [To BOYET] and might not you
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out. Go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? There's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.

BOYET

KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
BEROWNE
Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

BEROWNE
2
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace; I have done.

COSTARD
2
BOYET
BEROWNE
O Lord, sir, they would know

BEROWNE
2
BOYET
COSTARD
What, are there but three?

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
No, sir; but it is vara fine,
For every one pursents three.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
And three times thrice is nine.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
Not so, sir; under correction, sir,
I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir-

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
Is not nine.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by
reck'ning, sir.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
How much is it?

COSTARD
1
BEROWNE
O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will
show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they
say, but to parfect one man in one poor man, Pompion the Great,
sir.

BEROWNE
1
COSTARD
Art thou one of the Worthies?

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
KING
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great;
for mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy; but I am
to stand for him.

BEROWNE
2
COSTARD
KING
Go, bid them prepare.

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
KING
We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

KING
3
COSTARD
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
BEROWNE
Berowne, they will shame us; let them not approach.

BEROWNE
3
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
COSTARD
We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy
To have one show worse than the King's and his company.

KING
3
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
COSTARD
I say they shall not come.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
BEROWNE
Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.
That sport best pleases that doth least know how;
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents.
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
When great things labouring perish in their birth.

BEROWNE
2
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
A right description of our sport, my lord.

ARMADO
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
breath as will utter a brace of words.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Doth this man serve God?

BEROWNE

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ARMADO
Why ask you?

BEROWNE
ARMADO
KING
'A speaks not like a man of God his making.

ARMADO
3
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
KING
That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I
protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too too vain,
too too vain; but we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la
guerra. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

KING

BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ARMADO
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents
Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate,
Alexander; Arinado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas
Maccabaeus.
And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
These four will change habits and present the other five.

BEROWNE
2
KING
ARMADO
There is five in the first show.

KING
3
BEROWNE
ARMADO
COSTARD
You are deceived, 'tis not so.

BEROWNE
2
KING
COSTARD
The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and
the boy:
Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

It is Great, sir.
Pompey surnam'd the Great,
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to
And travelling along this coast, I bere am come by chance,
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France.
If your ladyship would say 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
COSTARD
BEROWNE
Great thanks, great Pompey.

COSTARD
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect.
I made a little fault in Great.

My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.

When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander;
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might.
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander-

NATHANIEL
Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right.

Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

COSTARD

BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
[To Sir Nathaniel] O, Sir, you have overthrown Alisander
the conqueror! You will be scrap'd out of the painted cloth for
this. Your lion, that holds his poleaxe sitting on a close-stool,
will be given to Ajax. He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror
and afeard to speak! Run away for shame, Alisander.
[Sir Nathaniel retires] There, an't shall please you, a foolish
mild man; an honest man, look you, and soon dash'd. He is a
marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good bowler; but for
Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted. But there
are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.

Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canus;
And when be was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
Ergo I come with this apology.
Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.      [MOTH retires]
Judas I am-

Not Iscariot, sir.
Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.

DUMAIN

Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

To make Judas hang himself.

Begin, sir; you are my elder.

Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

HOLOFERNES

I will not be put out of countenance.

BEROWNE

Because thou hast no face.

HOLOFERNES

What is this?

BOYET

DUMAIN

A cittern-head.

The head of a bodkin.

BEROWNE

A death's face in a ring.

LONGAVILLE

The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.

BOYET

The pommel of Coesar's falchion.

Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

DUMAIN

HOLOFERNES
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

BEROWNE

DUMAIN
HOLOFERNES
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now,
forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

HOLOFERNES

DUMAIN

You have put me out of countenance.

BEROWNE

DUMAIN
HOLOFERNES

False: we have given thee faces.

HOLOFERNES

But you have outfac'd them all.

An thou wert a lion we would do so.

Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.

DUMAIN

BOYET
BEROWNE

For the latter end of his name.

BEROWNE

For the ass to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away.

Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.

BOYET

But is this Hector?

DUMAIN

I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.

LONGAVILLE

His leg is too big for Hector's.

DUMAIN

More calf, certain.

No; he is best indued in the small.

This cannot be Hector.

DUMAIN

BOYET
BEROWNE

He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.

ARMADO

The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
Gave Hector a gift-

A gilt nutmeg.

BEROWNE

A lemon.

LONGAVILLE

No, cloven.

ARMADO

Peace!
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
From morn till night out of his pavilion.
I am that flower-

DUMAIN

ARMADO
LONGAVILLE
That mint.

LONGAVILLE

That columbine.

ARMADO

Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.

What meanest thou?

Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench

Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.

By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.

The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward

BOYET
3
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;
since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of
Jaquenetta's, and that 'a wears next his heart for a favour.

Madam, not so; I do beseech you stay.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KING
BEROWNE
Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath- your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

KING
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed;
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate.
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
I understand you not; my griefs are double.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the King.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths; your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents;
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain;
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance;
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if in your heavenly eyes
Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both- fair ladies, you;
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
4
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
KING
LONGAVILLE
We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time;
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.

Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

So did our looks.

ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
LONGAVILLE
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KING
ROSALINE
BEROWNE
A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjur'd much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this,
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught- this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood,
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial, and last love,
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come, challenge me, challenge me by these deserts;
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut
My woeful self up in a mournful house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither intitled in the other's heart.

KING

BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
ROSALINE
If this, or more than this, I would deny,
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
Hence hermit then, my heart is in thy breast.

And what to me, my love? and what to me?

DUMAIN
BEROWNE
KATHARINE
KING
You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;
You are attaint with faults and perjury;
Therefore, if you my favour mean to get,
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
But seek the weary beds of people sick.

DUMAIN

KATHARINE
BEROWNE
ROSALINE
But what to me, my love? but what to me?
A wife?

KATHARINE

DUMAIN
ROSALINE
A beard, fair health, and honesty;
With threefold love I wish you all these three.

DUMAIN

KATHARINE
ROSALINE
O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?

KATHARINE

DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say.
Come when the King doth to my lady come;
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.

DUMAIN

KATHARINE
LONGAVILLE
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

KATHARINE

Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.

What says Maria?

MARIA

At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

LONGAVILLE

KATHARINE

I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

MARIA

The liker you; few taller are so young.

BEROWNE

MARIA
ROSALINE
LONGAVILLE
Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there.
Impose some service on me for thy love.

ROSALINE

BEROWNE
MARIA
Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick, and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

BEROWNE

ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible;
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

ROSALINE
2
BEROWNE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it; then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal.
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.

BEROWNE

A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

[ To the King] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take
my leave.

KING

No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

ARMADO
Our wooing doth not end like an old play:
Jack hath not Jill. These ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.

KING

BEROWNE

ARMADO
Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth an' a day,
And then 'twill end.

BEROWNE

That's too long for a play.

DUMAIN
KING
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a
votary: I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her
sweet love three year. But, most esteemed greatness, will you
hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in
praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo? It should have followed in the
end of our show.

KING
2
DUMAIN
ARMADO
Call them forth quickly; we will do so.

ARMADO

DUMAIN
KING
Holla! approach.
This side is Hiems, Winter; this Ver, the Spring- the one
maintained by the Owl, th' other by the Cuckoo. Ver, begin.

ARMADO

KING
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo.
You that way: we this way.
