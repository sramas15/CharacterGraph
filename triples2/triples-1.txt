Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust.

CLEOPATRA

ANTONY
PHILO
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
PHILO
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

CLEOPATRA
2
ANTONY
PHILO
I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
News, my good lord, from Rome.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Grates me the sum.

CLEOPATRA
2
ANTONY
MESSENGER
Nay, hear them, Antony.
Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
Perform't, or else we damn thee.'

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
How, my love?

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Perchance? Nay, and most like,
You must not stay here longer; your dismission
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
We stand up peerless.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
Will be himself.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
DEMETRIUS
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?

CLEOPATRA
2
ANTONY
DEMETRIUS
Hear the ambassadors.

ANTONY
3
CLEOPATRA
DEMETRIUS
PHILO
Fie, wrangling queen!
Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,
To weep; whose every passion fully strives
To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.
No messenger but thine, and all alone
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.

DEMETRIUS
3
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
PHILO
Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?

PHILO
2
DEMETRIUS
ANTONY
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.

DEMETRIUS
2
ANTONY
PHILO
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar, who
Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
charge his horns with garlands!

I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS

SOOTHSAYER
CHARMIAN
Nay, hear him.

CHARMIAN
2
SOOTHSAYER
ALEXAS
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

SOOTHSAYER

CHARMIAN
ALEXAS
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

CHARMIAN

SOOTHSAYER

O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.

SOOTHSAYER

You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.

SOOTHSAYER
ALEXAS
Then belike my children shall have no names.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

SOOTHSAYER

CHARMIAN

If every of your wishes had a womb,

Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

CHARMIAN
ENOBARBUS
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

CHARMIAN

IRAS
SOOTHSAYER
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.

SOOTHSAYER
2
IRAS
CHARMIAN
Your fortunes are alike.

IRAS
2
SOOTHSAYER
CHARMIAN
But how, but how? Give me particulars.

SOOTHSAYER
2
IRAS
CHARMIAN
I have said.

IRAS
2
SOOTHSAYER
CHARMIAN
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

CHARMIAN
2
IRAS
SOOTHSAYER
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
where would you choose it?

IRAS
2
SOOTHSAYER
CHARMIAN
Not in my husband's nose.

CHARMIAN
2
IRAS
ALEXAS
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
Isis, I beseech thee!

IRAS
2
CHARMIAN
ALEXAS
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

CHARMIAN
3
IRAS
ALEXAS
ENOBARBUS
Amen.

ALEXAS

IRAS
CHARMIAN
ENOBARBUS
Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!

ENOBARBUS

Hush! Here comes Antony.

CHARMIAN

Not he; the Queen.

Saw you my lord?

ENOBARBUS

No, lady.

CLEOPATRA

Was he not here?

CHARMIAN

CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
No, madam.

CLEOPATRA

He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

CLEOPATRA

CHARMIAN
ENOBARBUS

Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?

Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

We will not look upon him. Go with us.

ALEXAS
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Against my brother Lucius?

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
Ay.
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
Whose better issue in the war from Italy
Upon the first encounter drave them.

ANTONY
1
MESSENGER
Well, what worst?

MESSENGER
1
ANTONY
The nature of bad news infects the teller.

ANTONY
1
MESSENGER
When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.

MESSENGER
1
ANTONY
Labienus-
This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
Extended Asia from Euphrates,
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia,
Whilst-

ANTONY
1
MESSENGER
Antony, thou wouldst say.

MESSENGER
1
ANTONY
O, my lord!

ANTONY
2
FIRST ATTENDANT
MESSENGER
Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

MESSENGER
2
FIRST ATTENDANT
ANTONY
At your noble pleasure.

ANTONY
2
FIRST ATTENDANT
SECOND ATTENDANT
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

FIRST ATTENDANT
2
ANTONY
SECOND ATTENDANT
The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?

SECOND ATTENDANT
2
FIRST ATTENDANT
ANTONY
He stays upon your will.

ANTONY
2
FIRST ATTENDANT
SECOND ATTENDANT
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
Or lose myself in dotage.

SECOND MESSENGER

ANTONY
SECOND ATTENDANT
Fulvia thy wife is dead.

ANTONY

SECOND MESSENGER
ENOBARBUS
SECOND ATTENDANT
Where died she?

SECOND MESSENGER
1
ANTONY
In Sicyon.
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]

ANTONY
2
SECOND MESSENGER
ENOBARBUS
Forbear me.

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
What our contempts doth often hurl from us
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution low'ring, does become
The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off.
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
What's your pleasure, sir?

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
I must with haste from hence.

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the
word.

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
I must be gone.

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but
the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die
twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle
in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
celerity in dying.

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
She is cunning past man's thought.

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters
sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than
almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Would I had never seen her!

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
your travel.

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Fulvia is dead.

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
Sir?

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Fulvia is dead.

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
Fulvia?

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Dead.

ENOBARBUS
1
ANTONY
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it
shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If
there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with
consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and
indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.

ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.

ENOBARBUS
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends
on your abode.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
No more light answers. Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
And get her leave to part. For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
To such whose place is under us, requires
Our quick remove from hence.

ENOBARBUS
3
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
CHARMIAN
I shall do't.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
Where is he?

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
I did not see him since.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
I did not send you. If you find him sad,
Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
What should I do I do not?

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
In time we hate that which we often fear.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
ANTONY
I am sick and sullen.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-

CLEOPATRA
2
ANTONY
CHARMIAN
Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
Will not sustain it.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Now, my dearest queen-

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Pray you, stand farther from me.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
What's the matter?

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
I know by that same eye there's some good news.
What says the married woman? You may go.
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
I have no power upon you; hers you are.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
The gods best know-

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
O, never was there queen
So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Cleopatra-

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Which break themselves in swearing!

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Most sweet queen-

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
Then was the time for words. No going then!
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor
But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
Art turn'd the greatest liar.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
How now, lady!

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Hear me, queen:
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile; but my full heart
Remains in use with you. Our Italy
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
Equality of two domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
By any desperate change. My more particular,
And that which most with you should safe my going,
Is Fulvia's death.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
She's dead, my Queen.
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
See when and where she died.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
As thou affects.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-
So Antony loves.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
My precious queen, forbear,
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
So Fulvia told me.
I prithee turn aside and weep for her;
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
Like perfect honour.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
You'll heat my blood; no more.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Now, by my sword-

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
And target. Still he mends;
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
I'll leave you, lady.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Courteous lord, one word.
Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.
That you know well. Something it is I would-
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
And I am all forgotten!

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
For idleness itself.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
'Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
Since my becomings kill me when they do not
Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
Be strew'd before your feet!

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
Let us go. Come.
Our separation so abides and flies
That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
Away!

CAESAR
1
LEPIDUS
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
Our great competitor. From Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow.

LEPIDUS
1
CAESAR
I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
Than what he chooses.

CAESAR
1
LEPIDUS
You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
No way excuse his foils when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
Call on him for't! But to confound such time
That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel to judgment.

LEPIDUS
2
CAESAR
MESSENGER
Here's more news.

MESSENGER
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
And it appears he is belov'd of those
That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
The discontents repair, and men's reports
Give him much wrong'd.

CAESAR
2
MESSENGER
LEPIDUS
I should have known no less.
It hath been taught us from the primal state
That he which is was wish'd until he were;
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
To rot itself with motion.

MESSENGER
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Caesar, I bring thee word
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.

CAESAR
2
MESSENGER
LEPIDUS
Antony,
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
Which some did die to look on. And all this-
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-
Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
So much as lank'd not.

LEPIDUS
2
CAESAR
MESSENGER
'Tis pity of him.

CAESAR
2
MESSENGER
LEPIDUS
Let his shames quickly
Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
Thrives in our idleness.

To-morrow, Caesar,
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.

CAESAR
1
LEPIDUS
Till which encounter
It is my business too. Farewell.

LEPIDUS
1
CAESAR
Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
To let me be partaker.

CAESAR
1
LEPIDUS
Doubt not, sir;
I knew it for my bond.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
Charmian!

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Madam?

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
Ha, ha!
Give me to drink mandragora.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Why, madam?

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
You think of him too much.

CLEOPATRA
2
MARDIAN
CHARMIAN
O, 'tis treason!

CHARMIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
MARDIAN
Madam, I trust, not so.

CLEOPATRA
2
MARDIAN
CHARMIAN
Thou, eunuch Mardian!

MARDIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
What's your Highness' pleasure?

CLEOPATRA
2
MARDIAN
CHARMIAN
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

MARDIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Yes, gracious madam.

CLEOPATRA
1
MARDIAN
Indeed?

MARDIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done.
Yet have I fierce affections, and think
What Venus did with Mars.

CLEOPATRA
1
MARDIAN
O Charmian,
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life.

ALEXAS
2
CLEOPATRA
MARDIAN
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

CLEOPATRA
2
MARDIAN
ALEXAS
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

ALEXAS
1
CLEOPATRA
Last thing he did, dear Queen,
He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

CLEOPATRA
1
ALEXAS
Mine ear must pluck it thence.

ALEXAS
1
CLEOPATRA
'Good friend,' quoth he
'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumb'd by him.

CLEOPATRA
1
ALEXAS
What, was he sad or merry?

ALEXAS
1
CLEOPATRA
Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
ALEXAS
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
He was not sad, for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?

ALEXAS
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
ALEXAS
Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?

CHARMIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
O that brave Caesar!

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
ALEXAS
Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
Say 'the brave Antony.'

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
The valiant Caesar!

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
My salad days,
When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
To say as I said then. But come, away!
Get me ink and paper.
He shall have every day a several greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

POMPEY
1
MENECRATES
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
The deeds of justest men.

MENECRATES
1
POMPEY
Know, worthy Pompey,
That what they do delay they not deny.

POMPEY
2
MENAS
MENECRATES
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
The thing we sue for.

MENECRATES
2
POMPEY
MENAS
We, ignorant of ourselves,
Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.

POMPEY
2
MENAS
MENECRATES
I shall do well.
The people love me, and the sea is mine;
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
Nor either cares for him.

MENAS
2
POMPEY
MENECRATES
Caesar and Lepidus
Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.

POMPEY
2
MENAS
MENECRATES
Where have you this? 'Tis false.

MENAS
1
POMPEY
From Silvius, sir.

POMPEY
1
MENAS
He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

VARRIUS
2
POMPEY
MENAS
This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
A space for farther travel.

POMPEY
2
VARRIUS
MENAS
I could have given less matter
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
For such a petty war; his soldiership
Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
The higher our opinion, that our stirring
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

MENAS
2
POMPEY
VARRIUS
I cannot hope
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
Not mov'd by Antony.

POMPEY
2
VARRIUS
MENAS
I know not, Menas,
How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
Were't not that we stand up against them all,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
May cement their divisions, and bind up
The petty difference we yet not know.
Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
Come, Menas.

LEPIDUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech.

ENOBARBUS
1
LEPIDUS
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
Let Antony look over Caesar's head
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
I would not shave't to-day.

LEPIDUS
1
ENOBARBUS
'Tis not a time
For private stomaching.

ENOBARBUS
1
LEPIDUS
Every time
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

LEPIDUS
1
ENOBARBUS
But small to greater matters must give way.

ENOBARBUS
1
LEPIDUS
Not if the small come first.

LEPIDUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Your speech is passion;
But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
The noble Antony.

ENOBARBUS
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
And yonder, Caesar.

ANTONY

CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
If we compose well here, to Parthia.
Hark, Ventidius.

CAESAR

ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.

LEPIDUS
2
CAESAR
ANTONY
Noble friends,
That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
May it be gently heard. When we debate
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
The rather for I earnestly beseech,
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
Nor curstness grow to th' matter.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
'Tis spoken well.
Were we before our arinies, and to fight,
I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
Welcome to Rome.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Thank you.

CAESAR

ANTONY
Sit.

ANTONY
1
CAESAR
Sit, sir.

CAESAR
1
ANTONY
Nay, then.                                  [They sit]

ANTONY
1
CAESAR
I learn you take things ill which are not so,
Or being, concern you not.

CAESAR
1
ANTONY
I must be laugh'd at
If, or for nothing or a little,
Should say myself offended, and with you
Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
Once name you derogately when to sound your name
It not concern'd me.

ANTONY
1
CAESAR
My being in Egypt, Caesar,
What was't to you?

CAESAR
1
ANTONY
No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
Might be my question.

ANTONY
1
CAESAR
How intend you- practis'd?

CAESAR
1
ANTONY
You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me, and their contestation
Was theme for you; you were the word of war.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
You do mistake your business; my brother never
Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
And have my learning from some true reports
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours,
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
As matter whole you have not to make it with,
It must not be with this.

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
You praise yourself
By laying defects of judgment to me; but
You patch'd up your excuses.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
Not so, not so;
I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
Very necessity of this thought, that I,
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
I would you had her spirit in such another!
The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

ENOBARBUS
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
wars with the women!

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
But say I could not help it.

CAESAR
3
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
I wrote to you
When rioting in Alexandria; you
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
Did gibe my missive out of audience.

ANTONY
3
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
Sir,
He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day
I told him of myself, which was as much
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
Out of our question wipe him.

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
You have broken
The article of your oath, which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with.

LEPIDUS
2
CAESAR
ANTONY
Soft, Caesar!

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
No;
Lepidus, let him speak.
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
The article of my oath-

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
The which you both denied.

ANTONY
3
MAECENAS
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Neglected, rather;
And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
To stoop in such a case.

LEPIDUS
4
MAECENAS
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
CAESAR
'Tis noble spoken.

MAECENAS

If it might please you to enforce no further
The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
Were to remember that the present need
Speaks to atone you.

LEPIDUS

ENOBARBUS
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.

ENOBARBUS

MAECENAS
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
do.

ANTONY

ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.

ENOBARBUS

That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

ANTONY

You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Go to, then- your considerate stone!

CAESAR
3
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
I do not much dislike the matter, but
The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
O' th' world, I would pursue it.

AGRIPPA
2
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
Give me leave, Caesar.

CAESAR
3
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
Speak, Agrippa.

AGRIPPA
2
CAESAR
ANTONY
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
Is now a widower.

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
AGRIPPA
Say not so, Agrippa.
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
Were well deserv'd of rashness.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
Agrippa further speak.

AGRIPPA
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
To hold you in perpetual amity,
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping knot, take Antony
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men;
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter. By this marriage
All little jealousies, which now seem great,
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
Would each to other, and all loves to both,
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
By duty ruminated.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Will Caesar speak?

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
AGRIPPA
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
With what is spoke already.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
What power is in Agrippa,
If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
To make this good?

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
The power of Caesar, and
His power unto Octavia.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
May I never
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
Further this act of grace; and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs!

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
There is my hand.
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
Fly off our loves again!

LEPIDUS
2
CAESAR
ANTONY
Happily, amen!

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
At heel of that, defy him.

LEPIDUS
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
Time calls upon's.
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Or else he seeks out us.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Where lies he?

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
About the Mount Misenum.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
What is his strength by land?

CAESAR
1
ANTONY
Great and increasing; but by sea
He is an absolute master.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
So is the fame.
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
The business we have talk'd of.

CAESAR
2
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
With most gladness;
And do invite you to my sister's view,
Whither straight I'll lead you.

Good Enobarbus!

MAECENAS

ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
the night light with drinking.

MAECENAS
2
ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
twelve persons there. Is this true?

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

MAECENAS
2
ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
upon the river of Cydnus.

AGRIPPA
2
MAECENAS
ENOBARBUS
There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
her.

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description. She did lie
In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,
O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
The fancy out-work nature. On each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
O, rare for Antony!

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
And made their bends adornings. At the helm
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her; and Antony,
Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
And made a gap in nature.

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
Rare Egyptian!

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper. She replied
It should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.

AGRIPPA
2
MAECENAS
ENOBARBUS
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
That she did make defect perfection,
And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.

MAECENAS
2
ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
Now Antony must leave her utterly.

ENOBARBUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Never! He will not.
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.

MAECENAS
2
ENOBARBUS
AGRIPPA
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
The heart of Antony, Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him.

Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?

Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!

ANTONY

SOOTHSAYER
If you can- your reason.

SOOTHSAYER
1
ANTONY
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
yet hie you to Egypt again.

ANTONY
1
SOOTHSAYER
Say to me,
Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

SOOTHSAYER
1
ANTONY
Caesar's.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
Make space enough between you.

ANTONY
1
SOOTHSAYER
Speak this no more.

SOOTHSAYER
1
ANTONY
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
But, he away, 'tis noble.

ANTONY
1
SOOTHSAYER
Get thee gone.
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
I' th' East my pleasure lies.

Follow me and receive't.

LEPIDUS

MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
Your generals after.

AGRIPPA

MAECENAS
LEPIDUS
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

LEPIDUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.

MAECENAS
2
AGRIPPA
LEPIDUS
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
Before you, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about.
You'll win two days upon me.

BOTH
2
MAECENAS
LEPIDUS
Sir, good success!

LEPIDUS
2
BOTH
MAECENAS
Farewell.

CLEOPATRA

CHARMIAN
Give me some music- music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.

ALL
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
The music, ho!

CLEOPATRA
3
ALL
CHARMIAN
MARDIAN
Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.

CHARMIAN
3
CLEOPATRA
MARDIAN
ALL
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

CLEOPATRA
3
ALL
CHARMIAN
MARDIAN
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

MARDIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
As well as I can, madam.

CLEOPATRA
2
MARDIAN
CHARMIAN
And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.
Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,
My music playing far off, I will betray
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
I'll think them every one an Antony,
And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'

CHARMIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
MARDIAN
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.

CLEOPATRA
2
MARDIAN
CHARMIAN
That time? O times
I laughed him out of patience; and that night
I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Madam, madam-

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
First, madam, he is well.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Why, there's more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Good madam, hear me.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Well, go to, I will.
But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony
Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour
To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
Not like a formal man.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Will't please you hear me?

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Madam, he's well.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Well said.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
And friends with Caesar.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Th'art an honest man.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Make thee a fortune from me.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
But yet, madam-

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;
In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
He's bound unto Octavia.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
For what good turn?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
For the best turn i' th' bed.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
I am pale, Charmian.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Madam, he's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Good madam, patience.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
Smarting in ling'ring pickle.

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Nay, then I'll run.
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
The man is innocent.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.
Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
He is afear'd to come.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
I will not hurt him.
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
A meaner than myself; since I myself
Have given myself the cause.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
I have done my duty.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
If thou again say 'Yes.'

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Should I lie, madam?

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
O, I would thou didst,
So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
I crave your Highness' pardon.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
He is married?

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Take no offence that I would not offend you;
To punish me for what you make me do
Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
And be undone by 'em!

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Good your Highness, patience.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Many times, madam.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
Her inclination; let him not leave out
The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian-
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
The other way's a Mars.                         [To MARDIAN]
Bid you Alexas
Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

POMPEY
1
CAESAR
Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
And we shall talk before we fight.

CAESAR
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
Most meet
That first we come to words; and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent;
Which if thou hast considered, let us know
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.

POMPEY
2
CAESAR
ANTONY
To you all three,
The senators alone of this great world,
Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
Wherefore my father should revengers want,
Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
There saw you labouring for him. What was't
That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,
With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
To drench the Capitol, but that they would
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.

CAESAR
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
Take your time.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st
How much we do o'er-count thee.

POMPEY
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
At land, indeed,
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
Remain in't as thou mayst.

LEPIDUS
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
CAESAR
Be pleas'd to tell us-
For this is from the present- how you take
The offers we have sent you.

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
There's the point.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
What it is worth embrac'd.

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
And what may follow,
To try a larger fortune.

POMPEY
2
CAESAR
ANTONY
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
Our targes undinted.

ALL
3
POMPEY
CAESAR
ANTONY
That's our offer.

POMPEY
3
ALL
CAESAR
ANTONY
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepar'd
To take this offer; but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
ALL
CAESAR
I have heard it, Pompey,
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.

POMPEY
3
ALL
ANTONY
CAESAR
Let me have your hand.
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

ANTONY
2
POMPEY
CAESAR
The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gained by't.

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
Since I saw you last
There is a change upon you.

POMPEY
3
CAESAR
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
Well, I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal.

LEPIDUS
2
POMPEY
CAESAR
Well met here.

POMPEY
3
CAESAR
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
I crave our composition may be written,
And seal'd between us.

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
That's the next to do.

POMPEY
3
CAESAR
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.

ANTONY
2
POMPEY
CAESAR
That will I, Pompey.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
No, Antony, take the lot;
But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.

ANTONY
1
POMPEY
You have heard much.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
I have fair meanings, sir.

ANTONY
2
POMPEY
ENOBARBUS
And fair words to them.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Then so much have I heard;
And I have heard Apollodorus carried-

ENOBARBUS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
No more of that! He did so.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
What, I pray you?

ENOBARBUS
1
POMPEY
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

POMPEY
1
ENOBARBUS
I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?

ENOBARBUS
1
POMPEY
Well;
And well am like to do, for I perceive
Four feasts are toward.

POMPEY
2
ALL
ENOBARBUS
Let me shake thy hand.
I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behaviour.

ENOBARBUS
2
POMPEY
ALL
Sir,
I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
As I have said you did.

POMPEY
3
ALL
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
Enjoy thy plainness;
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all.
Will you lead, lords?

ALL
3
POMPEY
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
Show's the way, sir.

POMPEY
3
ALL
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
Come.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
treaty.- You and I have known, sir.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
At sea, I think.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
We have, sir.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
You have done well by water.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
And you by land.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
Nor what I have done by water.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
have been a great thief by sea.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
And you by land.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two
thieves kissing.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
No slander: they steal hearts.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
you, is he married to Cleopatra?

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
Pray ye, sir?

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
'Tis true.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
prophesy so.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
than the love of the parties.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
Who would not have his wife so?

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He
will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia
blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he
married but his occasion here.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
health for you.

ENOBARBUS
1
MENAS
I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.

MENAS
1
ENOBARBUS
Come, let's away.

FIRST SERVANT
1
SECOND SERVANT
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them
down.

SECOND SERVANT
1
FIRST SERVANT
Lepidus is high-colour'd.

FIRST SERVANT
1
SECOND SERVANT
They have made him drink alms-drink.

SECOND SERVANT
1
FIRST SERVANT
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself
to th' drink.

FIRST SERVANT
1
SECOND SERVANT
But it raises the greater war between him and his
discretion.

SECOND SERVANT
1
FIRST SERVANT
Why, this it is to have a name in great men's
fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service
as a partizan I could not heave.

FIRST SERVANT
1
SECOND SERVANT
To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully
disaster the cheeks.

ANTONY
3
FIRST SERVANT
SECOND SERVANT
LEPIDUS
[To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know
By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS
2
ANTONY
FIRST SERVANT
Y'have strange serpents there.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
FIRST SERVANT
LEPIDUS
Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.

ANTONY
2
POMPEY
LEPIDUS
They are so.

POMPEY
3
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS
4
POMPEY
ANTONY
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

ENOBARBUS
3
POMPEY
MENAS
LEPIDUS
Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till
then.

LEPIDUS
3
POMPEY
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are
very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.

MENAS
3
POMPEY
ENOBARBUS
LEPIDUS
[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

POMPEY
2
MENAS
LEPIDUS
[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?

MENAS
2
POMPEY
LEPIDUS
[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
And hear me speak a word.

POMPEY
3
ANTONY
MENAS
LEPIDUS
[ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
This wine for Lepidus!

LEPIDUS
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
MENAS
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

ANTONY
2
POMPEY
LEPIDUS
It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements
once out of it, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
What colour is it of?

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
Of it own colour too.

LEPIDUS
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
'Tis a strange serpent.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
CAESAR
LEPIDUS
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
LEPIDUS
Will this description satisfy him?

ANTONY
4
POMPEY
CAESAR
MENAS
LEPIDUS
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
epicure.

POMPEY
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
MENAS
[Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
Rise from thy stool.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
MENAS
[Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks
aside] The matter?

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
MENAS
Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
Be jolly, lords.

ANTONY
2
POMPEY
MENAS
These quicksands, Lepidus,
Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
MENAS
What say'st thou?

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY
1
MENAS
How should that be?

MENAS
1
POMPEY
But entertain it,
And though you think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY
1
MENAS
Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS
1
POMPEY
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;
Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY
1
MENAS
Show me which way.

MENAS
1
POMPEY
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
All there is thine.

POMPEY
2
ANTONY
MENAS
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done,
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ANTONY
[Aside] For this,
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
Shall never find it more.

POMPEY
3
ANTONY
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
This health to Lepidus!

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

ENOBARBUS
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
MENAS
Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY
2
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
Fill till the cup be hid.

ENOBARBUS
2
POMPEY
MENAS
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ENOBARBUS
Why?

ENOBARBUS
2
POMPEY
MENAS
'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?

MENAS
2
POMPEY
ENOBARBUS
The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
That it might go on wheels!

ENOBARBUS
2
POMPEY
MENAS
Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Come.

POMPEY

ANTONY
MENAS
ENOBARBUS
CAESAR
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
CAESAR
MENAS
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
Here's to Caesar!

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
And it grows fouler.

ANTONY
3
POMPEY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
Be a child o' th' time.

CAESAR
3
POMPEY
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Possess it, I'll make answer.
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.

ENOBARBUS

POMPEY
CAESAR
ANTONY
[To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY

CAESAR
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Let's ha't, good soldier.

ANTONY

POMPEY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
Come, let's all take hands,
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe.

ENOBARBUS

POMPEY
ANTONY
CAESAR
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music,
The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.

CAESAR

POMPEY
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
Let me request you off; our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY

CAESAR
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
I'll try you on the shore.

ANTONY

POMPEY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
And shall, sir. Give's your hand.

MENAS
O Antony,
You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.
Come, down into the boat.

ENOBARBUS

POMPEY
ANTONY
MENAS
Take heed you fall not.
Menas, I'll not on shore.

MENAS

POMPEY
ENOBARBUS
No, to my cabin.
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!

MENAS
Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.

Hoo! Noble Captain, come.

VENTIDIUS

SILIUS
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS
1
VENTIDIUS
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS
1
SILIUS
O Silius, Silius,
I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer, than person. Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.

SILIUS
1
VENTIDIUS
Thou hast, Ventidius, that
Without the which a soldier and his sword
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?

VENTIDIUS
1
SILIUS
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' th' field.

SILIUS
1
VENTIDIUS
Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS
1
SILIUS
He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with's will permit,
We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.

AGRIPPA

SILIUS
VENTIDIUS
ENOBARBUS
What, are the brothers parted?

ENOBARBUS
2
VENTIDIUS
AGRIPPA
They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA
2
ENOBARBUS
VENTIDIUS
'Tis a noble Lepidus.

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.
Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA
1
ENOBARBUS
Both he loves.

ENOBARBUS
1
AGRIPPA
They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA

ENOBARBUS
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.

AGRIPPA
No further, sir.

CAESAR

ANTONY
AGRIPPA
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love
To keep it builded be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.

ANTONY
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Make me not offended
In your distrust.

CAESAR

OCTAVIA
ANTONY
I have said.

ANTONY
2
OCTAVIA
CAESAR
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.

CAESAR

OCTAVIA
ANTONY
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
The elements be kind to thee and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.

Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-

What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA

I'll tell you in your ear.

ANTONY

OCTAVIA
CAESAR

Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can

[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA

ANTONY

[Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.

CAESAR
AGRIPPA
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a
So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA
2
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

ENOBARBUS

CAESAR
ANTONY
AGRIPPA
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't- till I weep too.

No, sweet Octavia,

Half afeard to come.

Go to, go to.

CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Good Majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleas'd.

CLEOPATRA

That Herod's head
I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

MESSENGER

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
Most gracious Majesty!

CLEOPATRA

ALEXAS
Didst thou behold Octavia?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Ay, dread Queen.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Where?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Madam, in Rome
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Is she as tall as me?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
She creeps.
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Is this certain?

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.
The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Excellent.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Guess at her years, I prithee.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Madam,
She was a widow.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
Widow? Charmian, hark!

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
And I do think she's thirty.

CLEOPATRA
1
MESSENGER
Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?

MESSENGER
1
CLEOPATRA
Round even to faultiness.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
Brown, madam; and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.

CLEOPATRA
2
CHARMIAN
MESSENGER
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepar'd.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
A proper man.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA
1
CHARMIAN
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN
1
CLEOPATRA
I warrant you, madam.

ANTONY
1
OCTAVIA
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
That were excusable, that and thousands more
Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
To public ear;
Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
Or did it from his teeth.

OCTAVIA
1
ANTONY
O my good lord,
Believe not all; or if you must believe,
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
Praying for both parts.
The good gods will mock me presently
When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'
Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way
'Twixt these extremes at all.

ANTONY
1
OCTAVIA
Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,
I lose myself; better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady,
I'll raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
So your desires are yours.

OCTAVIA
1
ANTONY
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
Should solder up the rift.

ANTONY
1
OCTAVIA
When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
Choose your own company, and command what cost
Your heart has mind to.

ENOBARBUS
1
EROS
How now, friend Eros!

EROS
1
ENOBARBUS
There's strange news come, sir.

ENOBARBUS
1
EROS
What, man?

EROS
1
ENOBARBUS
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

ENOBARBUS
1
EROS
This is old. What is the success?

EROS
1
ENOBARBUS
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the
glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters
he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

ENOBARBUS
1
EROS
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS
1
ENOBARBUS
He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murd'red Pompey.

ENOBARBUS
1
EROS
Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS
1
ENOBARBUS
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
My lord desires you presently; my news
I might have told hereafter.

ENOBARBUS
1
EROS
'Twill be naught;
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS
1
ENOBARBUS
Come, sir.

CAESAR
1
MAECENAS
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:
I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute queen.

MAECENAS
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
This in the public eye?

CAESAR
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
As 'tis reported, so.

MAECENAS
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Let Rome be thus
Inform'd.

AGRIPPA
2
MAECENAS
CAESAR
Who, queasy with his insolence
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

CAESAR
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
His accusations.

AGRIPPA
2
MAECENAS
CAESAR
Who does he accuse?

CAESAR
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.

AGRIPPA
2
MAECENAS
CAESAR
Sir, this should be answer'd.

CAESAR
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
That he his high authority abus'd,
And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
Demand the like.

MAECENAS
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
He'll never yield to that.

CAESAR
2
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

OCTAVIA
2
MAECENAS
CAESAR
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

CAESAR
2
OCTAVIA
MAECENAS
That ever I should call thee cast-away!

OCTAVIA
1
CAESAR
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

CAESAR
1
OCTAVIA
Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which left unshown
Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you
By sea and land, supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA
1
CAESAR
Good my lord,
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd
His pardon for return.

CAESAR
1
OCTAVIA
Which soon he granted,
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA
1
CAESAR
Do not say so, my lord.

CAESAR
1
OCTAVIA
I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?

OCTAVIA
1
CAESAR
My lord, in Athens.

CAESAR
2
OCTAVIA
AGRIPPA
No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore, who now are levying
The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with
More larger list of sceptres.

OCTAVIA

CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Ay me most wretched,
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,
That does afflict each other!

CAESAR

OCTAVIA
MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
Welcome hither.
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
O'er your content these strong necessities,
But let determin'd things to destiny
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
To do you justice, make their ministers
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA

OCTAVIA
MAECENAS
CAESAR
Welcome, lady.

MAECENAS
3
OCTAVIA
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off,
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA
3
MAECENAS
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
Is it so, sir?

CAESAR
2
OCTAVIA
MAECENAS
Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!

CLEOPATRA
1
ENOBARBUS
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

ENOBARBUS
1
CLEOPATRA
But why, why,

CLEOPATRA
1
ENOBARBUS
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
And say'st it is not fit.

ENOBARBUS
1
CLEOPATRA
Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA
1
ENOBARBUS
Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
Be there in person?

ENOBARBUS
1
CLEOPATRA
[Aside] Well, I could reply:
If we should serve with horse and mares together
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
A soldier and his horse.

CLEOPATRA
1
ENOBARBUS
What is't you say?

ENOBARBUS
1
CLEOPATRA
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,
What should not then be spar'd. He is already
Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.

CLEOPATRA
1
ENOBARBUS
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;
I will not stay behind.

ENOBARBUS
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
Nay, I have done.
Here comes the Emperor.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
Is it not strange, Canidius,
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?

CLEOPATRA
3
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
CANIDIUS
Celerity is never more admir'd
Than by the negligent.

ANTONY
3
CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
CANIDIUS
A good rebuke,
Which might have well becom'd the best of men
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
Will fight with him by sea.

CLEOPATRA
2
ANTONY
CANIDIUS
By sea! What else?

CANIDIUS
3
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Why will my lord do so?

ANTONY
3
CLEOPATRA
CANIDIUS
ENOBARBUS
For that he dares us to't.

ENOBARBUS
2
ANTONY
CANIDIUS
So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.

CANIDIUS
2
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
And so should you.

ENOBARBUS
2
ANTONY
CANIDIUS
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;
Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepar'd for land.

ANTONY
3
CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
CANIDIUS
By sea, by sea.

ENOBARBUS
3
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
CANIDIUS
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army, which doth most consist
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
From firm security.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
I'll fight at sea.

CLEOPATRA
2
ANTONY
ENOBARBUS
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
We then can do't at land.

MESSENGER
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
Caesar has taken Toryne.

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
MESSENGER
Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
Away, my Thetis!

SOLDIER

ANTONY
MESSENGER
CANIDIUS
O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth
And fighting foot to foot.

You keep by land

Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,

Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle

The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies
Upon this jump.

Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
We may the number of the ships behold,
And so proceed accordingly.

ENOBARBUS

Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
To see't mine eyes are blasted.

All the whole synod of them!

SCARUS

The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.

ENOBARBUS

SCARUS
How appears the fight?

SCARUS
1
ENOBARBUS
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-
The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
Hoists sails and flies.

ENOBARBUS
1
SCARUS
That I beheld;
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
Endure a further view.

SCARUS
1
ENOBARBUS
She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.

ENOBARBUS

SCARUS
Alack, alack!

CANIDIUS

SCARUS
ENOBARBUS
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
O, he has given example for our flight
Most grossly by his own!

Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why then, good night indeed.

Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.

And make your peace with Caesar.

I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
I have myself resolv'd upon a course
Which has no need of you; be gone.
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;
Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;
Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]

Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,
Making and marring fortunes. You did know

My sword, made weak by my affection, would
Obey it on all cause.

Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates

We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

Let him appear that's come from Antony.
Know you him?

DOLABELLA

Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.

To his grand sea.

CAESAR

EUPHRONIUS
DOLABELLA
Be't so. Declare thine office.

EUPHRONIUS
1
CAESAR
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
He lessens his requests and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
A private man in Athens. This for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
Now hazarded to thy grace.

CAESAR
2
EUPHRONIUS
THYREUS
For Antony,
I have no ears to his request. The Queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
Or take his life there. This if she perform,
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

EUPHRONIUS

Fortune pursue thee!

Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
In every power that moves.

Caesar, I shall.

What shall we do, Enobarbus?

ENOBARBUS

Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA

ENOBARBUS
Is Antony or we in fault for this?

ENOBARBUS
1
CLEOPATRA
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA

Prithee, peace.

He says so.

ANTONY

Let her know't.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.

CLEOPATRA
2
EUPHRONIUS
ANTONY
That head, my lord?

ANTONY
2
CLEOPATRA
EUPHRONIUS
To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,
May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart,
And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.

EUPHRONIUS
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
[Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them,
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
His judgment too.

[Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
The loyalty well held to fools does make

So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

ENOBARBUS

CLEOPATRA

He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know
Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.

THYREUS

Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
Further than he is Caesar.

The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
Not as deserv'd.

What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
But conquer'd merely.

ENOBARBUS

I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
Thy dearest quit thee.

THYREUS
1
CLEOPATRA
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him? For he partly begs
To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put yourself under his shroud,
The universal landlord.

Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation

To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.

THYREUS

If that the former dare but what it can,
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand.

When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,

Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!

Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am

Take hence this Jack and whip him.

'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp

Moon and stars!
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name

Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.

You have been a boggler ever.
But when we in our viciousness grow hard-

In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
To our confusion.

CLEOPATRA

ANTONY
O, is't come to this?

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment
Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,
Though you can guess what temperance should be,
You know not what it is.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Wherefore is this?

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
To let a fellow that will take rewards,
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
And to proclaim it civilly were like
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
For being yare about him.

ANTONY

If that thy father live, let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee!
Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
He makes me angry with him; for he seems
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
When my good stars, that were my former guides,
Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
My speech and what is done, tell him he has
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
Hence with thy stripes, be gone.

CLEOPATRA

To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
With one that ties his points?

CLEOPATRA

Not know me yet?

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
Cold-hearted toward me?

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Ah, dear, if I be so,
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
And poison it in the source, and the first stone
Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
Together with my brave Egyptians all,
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
I am satisfied.
Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
There's hope in't yet.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
That's my brave lord!

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
Let's mock the midnight bell.

CLEOPATRA

ANTONY
It is my birthday.
I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

Call all his noble captains to my lord.

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
I'll make death love me; for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe.

ENOBARBUS
0
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
A diminution in our captain's brain
Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
Some way to leave him.

CAESAR
1
MAECENAS
He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die, meantime
Laugh at his challenge.

MAECENAS
1
CAESAR
Caesar must think
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
Made good guard for itself.

CAESAR
1
MAECENAS
Let our best heads
Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight. Within our files there are
Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late
Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

ANTONY

He will not fight with me, Domitius?

ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
No.

ANTONY

He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS
To-morrow, soldier,
By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

ANTONY

Well said; come on.
Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
Be bounteous at our meal.

And kings have been your fellows.

Haply you shall not see me more; or if,

As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,

Married to your good service, stay till death.
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
And the gods yield you for't!

Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
You take me in too dolorous a sense;
For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
And drown consideration.

Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
And leave his master Antony. For this pains
Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment, but
No honourable trust. I have done ill,
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
That I will joy no more.

I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer
Out of the host. I must attend mine office,
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.

ENOBARBUS

I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee? No! I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.

AGRIPPA

Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.

Had we done so at first, we had droven them home

Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
For thy good valour. Come thee on.

We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood
That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been
Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
The honour'd gashes whole.

Mine nightingale,
We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey
Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand-
Kiss it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day
As if a god in hate of mankind had
Destroyed in such a shape.

CLEOPATRA

I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand.
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together,
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
Applauding our approach.

In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,

Of what he has and has not.

My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder

Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,

A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,

With trees upon't that nod unto the world
And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.

My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
Unto an enemy's triumph.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves.

Death of one person can be paid but once,
And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake

The name of Antony; it was divided
Between her heart and lips. She rend'red life,
Thy name so buried in her.

The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.

EROS

ANTONY
What would my lord?

ANTONY
1
EROS
Since Cleopatra died,
I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
That, when the exigent should come- which now
Is come indeed- when I should see behind me
Th' inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.
Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
Put colour in thy cheek.

EROS
1
ANTONY
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim and could not?

ANTONY
1
EROS
Eros,
Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
His baseness that ensued?

EROS
1
ANTONY
I would not see't.

ANTONY
1
EROS
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country.

EROS
1
ANTONY
O, sir, pardon me!

ANTONY
1
EROS
When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.

Turn from me then that noble countenance,
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,

His death's upon him, but not dead.
Look out o' th' other side your monument;
His guard have brought him thither.

CHARMIAN
O sun,
Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand
The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony,
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
DIOMEDES
Peace!
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.

CLEOPATRA

DIOMEDES
ANTONY
So it should be, that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
I here importune death awhile, until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
I dare not, dear.
Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,
Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show
Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall
Be brooch'd with me. If knife, drugs, serpents, have
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony-
Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
Assist, good friends.

ANTONY
1
CLEOPATRA
O, quick, or I am gone.

CLEOPATRA
1
ANTONY
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness;
That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
Wishers were ever fools. O come, come,
And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
Thus would I wear them out.

ALL

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
A heavy sight!

ANTONY

I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

No, let me speak; and let me rail so high
That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
Provok'd by my offence.

ANTONY

One word, sweet queen:
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!

Gentle, hear me:
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Caesar

ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
CHARMIAN
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,
The noblest; and do now not basely die,
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman- a Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going
I can no more.

ANTONY
CHARMIAN
Noblest of men, woo't die?
Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]
The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.                          [Swoons]

CLEOPATRA

IRAS
CHARMIAN
No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
Patience is sottish, and impatience does
Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
But resolution and the briefest end.

CAESAR

DOLABELLA
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
The pauses that he makes.

DOLABELLA

CAESAR
Caesar, I shall.

CAESAR
1
DERCETAS
Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
Appear thus to us?

DERCETAS
1
CAESAR
I am call'd Dercetas;
Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
He was my master, and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee, as I was to him
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
I yield thee up my life.

CAESAR
1
DERCETAS
What is't thou say'st?

DERCETAS
1
CAESAR
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

CAESAR
2
DERCETAS
AGRIPPA
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack. The round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets,
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
Is not a single doom; in the name lay
A moiety of the world.

DERCETAS
2
CAESAR
AGRIPPA
He is dead, Caesar,
Not by a public minister of justice,
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
Which writ his honour in the acts it did
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
With his most noble blood.

When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
He needs must see himself.

CAESAR

MAECENAS
AGRIPPA
O Antony,
I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance
Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day
Or look on thine; we could not stall together
In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
That thou, my brother, my competitor
In top of all design, my mate in empire,
Friend and companion in the front of war,
The arm of mine own body, and the heart
Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
Unreconciliable, should divide
Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-

EGYPTIAN

MAECENAS
CAESAR
A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,
Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
Of thy intents desires instruction,
That she preparedly may frame herself
To th' way she's forc'd to.

CAESAR

MAECENAS
EGYPTIAN
PROCULEIUS
Bid her have good heart.
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
How honourable and how kindly we
Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn
To be ungentle.

PROCULEIUS
So the gods preserve thee!

CAESAR
1
PROCULEIUS
Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts
The quality of her passion shall require,
Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
And how you find her.

PROCULEIUS

Caesar, I shall.

CAESAR

Let him alone, for I remember now
How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war,
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings. Go with me, and see
What I can show in this.

CLEOPATRA
0
My desolation does begin to make
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
A minister of her will; and it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.

PROCULEIUS
1
CLEOPATRA
Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.

CLEOPATRA

PROCULEIUS
What's thy name?

PROCULEIUS
1
CLEOPATRA
My name is Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA
1
PROCULEIUS
Antony
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
That have no use for trusting. If your master
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
That majesty, to keep decorum, must
No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
He gives me so much of mine own as I
Will kneel to him with thanks.

PROCULEIUS
1
CLEOPATRA
Be of good cheer;
Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
Make your full reference freely to my lord,
Who is so full of grace that it flows over
On all that need. Let me report to him
Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.

CLEOPATRA
1
PROCULEIUS
Pray you tell him
I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
Look him i' th' face.

PROCULEIUS

This I'll report, dear lady.
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied

Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
His nobleness well acted, which your death

Where art thou, death?
Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
Worth many babes and beggars!

PROCULEIUS

O, temperance, lady!

CLEOPATRA

PROCULEIUS
Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;
If idle talk will once be necessary,
I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud
Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
And hang me up in chains!

PROCULEIUS

You do extend
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar.

DOLABELLA

And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
I'll take her to my guard.

So, Dolabella,
It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
[To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
If you'll employ me to him.

Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?

I cannot tell.

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Assuredly you know me.

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
Is't not your trick?

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
I understand not, madam.

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-
O, such another sleep, that I might see
But such another man!

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
If it might please ye-

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
The little O, the earth.

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Most sovereign creature-

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
Crested the world. His voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
That grew the more by reaping. His delights
Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above
The element they liv'd in. In his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Cleopatra-

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
Think you there was or might be such a man
As this I dreamt of?

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Gentle madam, no.

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But if there be nor ever were one such,
It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
As answering to the weight. Would I might never
O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root.

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
I thank you, sir.
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
Nay, pray you, sir.

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Though he be honourable-

CLEOPATRA
1
DOLABELLA
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

DOLABELLA
1
CLEOPATRA
Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]

CAESAR

CLEOPATRA

Sir, the gods
Will have it thus; my master and my lord
I must obey.

CAESAR

Take to you no hard thoughts.
The record of what injuries you did us,
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
As things but done by chance.

CLEOPATRA
1
CAESAR
Sole sir o' th' world,
I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear, but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often sham'd our sex.

CAESAR
1
CLEOPATRA
Cleopatra, know
We will extenuate rather than enforce.
If you apply yourself to our intents-
Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty by taking
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
Of my good purposes, and put your children
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

CLEOPATRA

CAESAR
SELEUCUS
And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

SELEUCUS
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

CLEOPATRA

Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

CAESAR
Here, madam.

CLEOPATRA

CAESAR
SELEUCUS
This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,
Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

SELEUCUS
2
CLEOPATRA
CAESAR
Madam,
I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
Speak that which is not.

CLEOPATRA
2
CAESAR
SELEUCUS
What have I kept back?

SELEUCUS
2
CLEOPATRA
CAESAR
Enough to purchase what you have made known.

CAESAR
2
CLEOPATRA
SELEUCUS
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
Your wisdom in the deed.

CLEOPATRA
2
CAESAR
SELEUCUS
See, Caesar! O, behold,
How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust
Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes
Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
O rarely base!

CAESAR
2
CLEOPATRA
SELEUCUS
Good Queen, let us entreat you.

CLEOPATRA
1
CAESAR
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal; and say
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
Their mediation- must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

CAESAR
1
CLEOPATRA
Forbear, Seleucus.

CLEOPATRA
1
CAESAR
Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and when we fall
We answer others' merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied.

CAESAR
1
CLEOPATRA
Cleopatra,
Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours,
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
Our care and pity is so much upon you
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.

You with your children will he send before.
Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.

Farewell, and thanks.

IRAS

The gods forbid!

CLEOPATRA
1
IRAS
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us, and present
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I' th' posture of a whore.

IRAS

CLEOPATRA
O the good gods!

CLEOPATRA

Nay, that's certain.

Why, that's the way
To fool their preparation and to conquer
Their most absurd intents.

GUARDSMAN

He brings you figs.

CLOWN
This is the man.

CLEOPATRA

GUARDSMAN
CLOWN
Avoid, and leave him.

CLOWN
1
CLEOPATRA
Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
do die of it do seldom or never recover.

CLEOPATRA
1
CLOWN
Remember'st thou any that have died on't?

CLOWN
1
CLEOPATRA
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no
longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given
to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how
she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes
a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that
they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is
most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.

CLEOPATRA
1
CLOWN
Get thee hence; farewell.

CLOWN

CLEOPATRA
I wish you all joy of the worm.

CLEOPATRA
1
CLOWN
Farewell.

CLOWN

You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his
kind.

CLEOPATRA
1
CLOWN
Ay, ay; farewell.

CLOWN
1
CLEOPATRA
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.

CLEOPATRA
1
CLOWN
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

CLOWN
1
CLEOPATRA
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
the feeding.

CLEOPATRA
1
CLOWN
Will it eat me?

CLOWN
1
CLEOPATRA
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for
the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same
whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
every ten that they make the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA

Well, get thee gone; farewell.

CHARMIAN
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me. Now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call. I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come.
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So, have you done?
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.

Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
The gods themselves do weep.

CLEOPATRA

CHARMIAN
This proves me base.
If she first meet the curled Antony,
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied!

O Eastern star!

Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
That sucks the nurse asleep?

O, break! O, break!

As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-
O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:
What should I stay-                                   [Dies]

CHARMIAN

CLEOPATRA
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it and then play-

It is well done, and fitting for a princes

Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]

Bravest at the last,
She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
I do not see them bleed.

Who was last with them?

A simple countryman that brought her figs.
This was his basket.

Poison'd then.

DOLABELLA
O Caesar,
This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood and spake.
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,
And on the sudden dropp'd.

CAESAR

FIRST GUARD
DOLABELLA
O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.

DOLABELLA

FIRST GUARD
CAESAR
Here on her breast
There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
The like is on her arm.

FIRST GUARD

CAESAR
DOLABELLA
This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves
Upon the caves of Nile.

CAESAR

DOLABELLA
Most probable
That so she died; for her physician tells me
She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
And bear her women from the monument.
She shall be buried by her Antony;
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous. High events as these
Strike those that make them; and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral,
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
High order in this great solemnity.
