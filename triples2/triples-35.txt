DUKE

ESCALUS
Escalus!

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
My lord.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
Of government the properties to unfold
Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse,
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you; then no more remains
But that to your sufficiency- as your worth is able-
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, y'are as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us, Angelo.

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
Look where he comes.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
Always obedient to your Grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life
That to th' observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise.
Hold, therefore, Angelo-
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO
1
DUKE
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE
1
ANGELO
No more evasion!
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.
To th' hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple: your scope is as mine own,
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes;
Though it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I'll wait upon your honour.

If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition
with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the
King.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
1
LUCIO
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Amen.

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to
sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap'd one out of the table.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Ay, that he raz'd.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain
and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal.
There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before
meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was
said.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
No? A dozen times at least.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
LUCIO
What, in metre?

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
In any proportion or in any language.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO
1
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,
for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all
grace.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
1
LUCIO
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO
1
FIRST GENTLEMAN
I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
Thou art the list.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of
an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French
velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of
thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin
thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
free.

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have
purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
To what, I pray?

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
LUCIO
Judge.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
To three thousand dolours a year.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
LUCIO
Ay, and more.

LUCIO
2
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
A French crown more.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO
2
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things
that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast
of thee.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
How now! which of your hips has the most profound
sciatica?

MRS OVERDONE
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
Who's that, I pray thee?

MRS OVERDONE
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.

MRS OVERDONE
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him
carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his
head to be chopp'd off.

LUCIO
3
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art
thou sure of this?

MRS OVERDONE
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.

LUCIO
3
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours
since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
SECOND GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
LUCIO
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO
3
SECOND GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
Away; let's go learn the truth of it.

MRS OVERDONE
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.

POMPEY
2
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
Yonder man is carried to prison.

MRS OVERDONE
2
POMPEY
LUCIO
Well, what has he done?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
A woman.

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
But what's his offence?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
What! is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
What proclamation, man?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that
a wise burgher put in for them.

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pull'd down?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
To the ground, mistress.

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.
Though you change your place you need not change your trade; I'll
be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you;
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will
be considered.

MRS OVERDONE
1
POMPEY
What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.

POMPEY
1
MRS OVERDONE
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;
and there's Madam Juliet.

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

PROVOST
2
LUCIO
CLAUDIO
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

LUCIO
2
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO
1
CLAUDIO
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for
certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief
have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment.
What's thy offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO
1
LUCIO
What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO
1
CLAUDIO
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
No.

LUCIO
2
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
Lechery?

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
Call it so.

PROVOST
2
LUCIO
CLAUDIO
Away, sir; you must go.

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO
2
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd
after?

CLAUDIO
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed.
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order; this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dow'r
Remaining in the coffer of her friends.
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,
With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO
1
CLAUDIO
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO
1
LUCIO
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the Duke-
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his eminence that fills it up,
I stagger in. But this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name.

LUCIO
1
CLAUDIO
I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy
shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off.
Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.

CLAUDIO
1
LUCIO
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter,
And there receive her approbation;
Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

LUCIO
1
CLAUDIO
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like,
which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the
enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus
foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO
1
LUCIO
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO
1
CLAUDIO
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO
1
LUCIO
Come, officer, away.

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS
1
DUKE
May your Grace speak of it?

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever lov'd the life removed,
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this.

FRIAR THOMAS
1
DUKE
Gladly, my lord.

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS
1
DUKE
It rested in your Grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
I do fear, too dreadful.
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo impos'd the office;
Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you.
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
FRANCISCA
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
FRANCISCA
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO
2
ISABELLA
FRANCISCA
[ Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
FRANCISCA
Who's that which calls?

FRANCISCA
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him:
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn;
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress;
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you answer him.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Why her 'unhappy brother'? Let me ask
The rather, for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella, and his sister.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Woe me! For what?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
It is true.
I would not- though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
Tongue far from heart- play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embrac'd.
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
She it is.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
O, let him marry her!

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
This is the point.
The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth, one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He- to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo. And that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Has censur'd him
Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Assay the pow'r you have.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
My power, alas, I doubt!

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Our doubts are traitors,
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
But speedily.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
Commend me to my brother; soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape till custom make it
Their perch, and not their terror.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little
Than fall and bruise to death. Alas! this gentleman,
Whom I would save, had a most noble father.
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of our blood
Could have attain'd th' effect of your own purpose
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO
2
PROVOST
ESCALUS
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes. What knows the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS
2
ANGELO
PROVOST
Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO
2
PROVOST
ESCALUS
Where is the Provost?

PROVOST
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO
2
PROVOST
ESCALUS
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning;
Bring him his confessor; let him be prepar'd;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall;
Some run from breaks of ice, and answer none,
And some condemned for a fault alone.

ELBOW
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
Come, bring them away; if these be good people in a
commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses,
I know no law; bring them away.

ANGELO
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the matter?

ELBOW
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke's constable,
and my name is Elbow; I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring
in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
malefactors?

ELBOW
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
If it please your honour, I know not well what they are; but
precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all
profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS

ELBOW
ANGELO
POMPEY
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO

ELBOW
POMPEY
ESCALUS
Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why
dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY
3
ANGELO
ELBOW
ESCALUS
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO
3
POMPEY
ELBOW
ESCALUS
What are you, sir?

ELBOW
3
ANGELO
POMPEY
ESCALUS
He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad
woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, pluck'd down in the
suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a
very ill house too.

ESCALUS

ELBOW
ANGELO
How know you that?

ELBOW

ANGELO
ESCALUS
My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-

ESCALUS

ELBOW
How! thy wife!

ELBOW
1
ESCALUS
Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-

ESCALUS

ELBOW
Dost thou detest her therefore?

ESCALUS
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that
this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life,
for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS
1
ELBOW
How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accus'd in fornication,
adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS
2
ELBOW
POMPEY
By the woman's means?

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in
his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,
prove it.

ESCALUS
2
ELBOW
POMPEY
Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY

ELBOW
ESCALUS
FROTH
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your
honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the
house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a
fruit dish, a dish of some three pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very good dishes.

ESCALUS
3
POMPEY
ELBOW
FROTH
Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the
right; but to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as
I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I
said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I
said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you
know, Master Froth, I could not give you three pence again-

FROTH
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
No, indeed.

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking
the stones of the foresaid prunes-

FROTH
1
POMPEY
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you
wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-

FROTH
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
All this is true.

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Why, very well then-

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me
to what was done to her.

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of
fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas- was't not
at Hallowmas, Master Froth?

FROTH
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY
3
ANGELO
ESCALUS
FROTH
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes,
where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?

FROTH
2
POMPEY
ANGELO
I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.

POMPEY
3
ANGELO
ESCALUS
FROTH
Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO
3
POMPEY
ESCALUS
FROTH
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave,
And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS

ANGELO
POMPEY
ELBOW
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
[

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
ELBOW
Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose. Doth
your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
Well, I do so.

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
ELBOW
Why, no.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
about him. Good then; if his face be the worst thing about him,
how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would
know that of your honour.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
ELBOW
He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected
woman.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
any of us all.

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or
child.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
ELBOW
Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
true?

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
respected with her before I was married to her! If ever I was
respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me
the poor Duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.

ESCALUS
2
ELBOW
POMPEY
If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW
1
ESCALUS
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS
2
ELBOW
FROTH
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his
courses till thou know'st what they are.

ELBOW
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked
varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art to continue now,
thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS

ELBOW
FROTH
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS

ELBOW
POMPEY
FROTH
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
Your mistress' name?

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY
2
ESCALUS
FROTH
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
would not have you acquainted with tapsters: they will draw you,
Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me
hear no more of you.

FROTH
2
POMPEY
ESCALUS
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into
any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
FROTH
Well, no more of it, Master Froth; farewell. [

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Pompey.

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
What else?

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey,
you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a
tapster. Are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better
for you.

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
the city?

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
No, Pompey.

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you
need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS
1
POMPEY
There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY
1
ESCALUS
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more
heads; if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest
house in it, after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come
to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS
2
POMPEY
ELBOW
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon
any complaint whatsoever- no, not for dwelling where you do; if I
do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt.
So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
ESCALUS
I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I
shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;
The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.

ESCALUS
1
ELBOW
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW
1
ESCALUS
Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS
1
ELBOW
I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say seven years together?

ELBOW
1
ESCALUS
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS
1
ELBOW
Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward
sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW
1
ESCALUS
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some
piece of money, and go through with all.

ESCALUS
2
ELBOW
JUSTICE
Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS
2
ELBOW
JUSTICE
To my house. Fare you well.              [

JUSTICE

ESCALUS
Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS
1
JUSTICE
I pray you home to dinner with me.

JUSTICE
1
ESCALUS
I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS
1
JUSTICE
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

JUSTICE
1
ESCALUS
Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS
1
JUSTICE
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.
But yet, poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

SERVANT
1
PROVOST
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
I'll tell him of you.

PROVOST
1
SERVANT
Pray you do. [

ANGELO
1
PROVOST
Now, what's the matter, Provost?

PROVOST
1
ANGELO
Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?

ANGELO
1
PROVOST
Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?

PROVOST
1
ANGELO
Lest I might be too rash;
Under your good correction, I have seen
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO
1
PROVOST
Go to; let that be mine.
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spar'd.

PROVOST
1
ANGELO
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

ANGELO
1
PROVOST
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

SERVANT

ANGELO
PROVOST
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.

ANGELO

SERVANT
PROVOST
Hath he a sister?

PROVOST
2
ANGELO
SERVANT
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

ANGELO
2
SERVANT
PROVOST
Well, let her be admitted.

PROVOST

ANGELO
ISABELLA
[Going] Save your honour!

ANGELO
2
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
your will?

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
PROVOST
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO
2
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
PROVOST
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO
2
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Well; the matter?

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
PROVOST
I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

PROVOST
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.

ANGELO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done;
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
You are too cold: if you should need a pin,
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
To him, I say.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Must he needs die?

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
I will not do't.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
But can you, if you would?

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] You are too cold.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
May call it back again. Well, believe this:
No ceremony that to great ones longs,
Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you, and you as he,
You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Pray you be gone.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge
And what a prisoner.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Alas! Alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Be you content, fair maid.
It is the law, not I condemn your brother.
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him. He must die to-morrow.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[Aside] Ay, well said.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
Those many had not dar'd to do that evil
If the first that did th' edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake,
Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-
Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born-
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But here they live to end.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] That's well said.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder,
Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,
Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,
Dress'd in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO
2
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
He's coming; I perceive 't.

PROVOST
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
[Aside] Pray heaven she win him.

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them;
But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
That in the captain's but a choleric word
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault. If it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
[Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
Such sense that my sense breeds with it.- Fare you well.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
How, bribe me?

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
Or stones, whose rate are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO

Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO

LUCIO
ISABELLA
[Aside] Amen; for I
Am that way going to temptation
Where prayers cross.

ISABELLA

ANGELO
LUCIO
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Save your honour!

ANGELO
0
From thee; even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flow'r,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
When men were fond, I smil'd and wond'red how.

DUKE

Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them, and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

PROVOST

I would do more than that, if more were needful.

And you shall be conducted.

DUKE

Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET

I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

And try your penitence, if it be sound
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET
1
DUKE
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE

JULIET
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET
1
DUKE
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE
1
JULIET
So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed.

JULIET

Mutually.

Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET

I do confess it, and repent it, father.

'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear-

JULIET

DUKE
PROVOST
I do repent me as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE

JULIET
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you! Benedicite!

JULIET

PROVOST
Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

PROVOST

JULIET
'Tis pity of him.

When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name,
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
Is, like a good thing being often read,
Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
'Tis not the devil's crest.

SERVANT

ANGELO
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO
1
SERVANT
Teach her the way. [

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
That you might know it would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Even so! Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
As long as you or I; yet he must die.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Under your sentence?

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Yea.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather- that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Sir, believe this:
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
How say you?

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life;
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Nay, but hear me;
Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant
Or seem so, craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me:
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross-
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
So.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
True.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Admit no other way to save his life,
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desir'd of such a person
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-binding law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-
What would you do?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
As much for my poor brother as myself;
That is, were I under the terms of death,
Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield
My body up to shame.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
We are all frail.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Else let my brother die,
If not a fedary but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women, help heaven! Men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
I think it well;
And from this testimony of your own sex,
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now
By putting on the destin'd livery.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
Let me intreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for't.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
I know your virtue hath a license in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't.
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, th' austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state,
Will so your accusation overweigh
That you shall stifle in your own report,
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can: my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA
0
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
Either of condemnation or approof,
Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

DUKE

CLAUDIO
So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO

The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die.

DUKE
1
CLAUDIO
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation where thou keep'st
Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exists on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
And Death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

ISABELLA

Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
Therefore, your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO

DUKE
ISABELLA
Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
But is there any?

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determin'd scope.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
But in what nature?

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Let me know the point.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flow'ry tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
The precise Angelo!

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed?

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
O heavens! it cannot be.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
O, were it but my life!
I'd throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Yes. Has he affections in him
That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose
When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;
Or of the deadly seven it is the least.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
Which is the least?

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel!

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
What says my brother?

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO
1
ISABELLA
Sweet sister, let me live.
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA
1
CLAUDIO
O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;
Die; perish. Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
CLAUDIO
O fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd;
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO

DUKE
ISABELLA
O, hear me, Isabella.

DUKE

Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA

DUKE

What is your will?

DUKE

ISABELLA
CLAUDIO
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
some speech with you; the satisfaction I would require is
likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA

DUKE
CLAUDIO
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out
of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

DUKE

PROVOST
ISABELLA
CLAUDIO
Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath
made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true;
therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your
resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die;
go to your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO

DUKE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE

Hold you there. Farewell. [

PROVOST

DUKE
What's your will, father?

DUKE
2
PROVOST
ISABELLA
That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch
her by my company.

PROVOST
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
In good time.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness;
but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body
of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty
hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How
will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how
much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo! If ever he return, and
I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his
government.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only.
Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in
doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to
your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
business.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great
soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
name.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the
contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:
there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward
her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate
husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries
of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which
she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is
washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man
live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in
doing it.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Show me how, good father.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
first affection; his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should
have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current,
made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to
the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that
your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all
shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course- and now follows all: we shall
advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your
place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and
the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for
his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the
doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What
think you of it?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke's; there,
at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be
quickly.

ISABELLA
1

I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the
pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st
thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th'
last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was,
man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE
2
POMPEY
LUCIO
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO
2
POMPEY
DUKE
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
ha?

POMPEY
2
LUCIO
DUKE
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
herself in the tub.

LUCIO

POMPEY
DUKE
ELBOW
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd
consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
LUCIO
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO
2
POMPEY
ELBOW
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
thither. For debt, Pompey- or how?

ELBOW
2
POMPEY
LUCIO
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
DUKE
Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of
antiquity, too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to
the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.

POMPEY

ELBOW
LUCIO
DUKE
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO
3
POMPEY
ELBOW
DUKE
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will
pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not
patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu trusty Pompey.
Bless you, friar.

DUKE

POMPEY
LUCIO
ELBOW
And you.

LUCIO

POMPEY
DUKE

Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW

Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY

ELBOW
LUCIO
You will not bail me then, sir?

LUCIO

POMPEY
ELBOW
DUKE
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?

ELBOW
3
POMPEY
LUCIO
DUKE
Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
DUKE
Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
What news, friar, of the Duke?

DUKE
2
ELBOW
LUCIO
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO
2
ELBOW
DUKE
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
in Rome; but where is he, think you?

DUKE
1
LUCIO
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo
dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
He does well in't.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till
eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not
made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it
true, think you?

DUKE
1
LUCIO
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes
water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he
is a motion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that
is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the
getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service,
and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
not inclin'd that way.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
O, sir, you are deceiv'd.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in
him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO
1
DUKE
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file
of the subject held the Duke to be wise.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Wise? Why, no question but he was.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a
warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but
testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to
the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you
speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much
dark'ned in your malice.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
love.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me
desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
have spoke, you have courage to maintain it; I am bound to call
upon you; and I pray you your name?

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
I fear you not.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me
too unhurtful an opposite. But, indeed, I can do you little harm:
you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no
more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke
we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent will
unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in
his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would
have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to
light. Would he were return'd! Marry, this Claudio is condemned
for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee pray for me. The
Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not
past it yet; and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar
though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.
Farewell.

No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

MRS OVERDONE
Go, away with her to prison.

DUKE
PROVOST
ESCALUS
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is
accounted a merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS

DUKE
PROVOST
MRS OVERDONE
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the
same kind! This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.

PROVOST

ESCALUS
MRS OVERDONE
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please your
honour.

MRS OVERDONE

PROVOST
ESCALUS
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke's time;
he promis'd her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old
come Philip and Jacob; I have kept it myself; and see how he goes
about to abuse me.

ESCALUS

DUKE
PROVOST
MRS OVERDONE
That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be call'd
before us. Away with her to prison. Go to; no more words.

PROVOST

So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advis'd
him for th' entertainment of death.

ESCALUS

PROVOST
Good even, good father.

DUKE

PROVOST
ESCALUS
Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS
2
DUKE
PROVOST
Of whence are you?

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time. I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his Holiness.

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
What news abroad i' th' world?

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and,
as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough
to make fellowships accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the
wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every
day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to
know himself.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all
temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they
may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find
Claudio prepar'd. I am made to understand that you have lent him
visitation.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
He professes to have received no sinister measure from his
judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good
leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner
the very debt of your calling. I have labour'd for the poor
gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother
justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it
shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath
sentenc'd himself.

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
Peace be with you!

MARIANA
1
DUKE
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away;
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.

DUKE
1
MARIANA
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good and good provoke to harm.
I pray you tell me hath anybody inquir'd for me here to-day. Much
upon this time have I promis'd here to meet.

MARIANA
1
DUKE
You have not been inquir'd after; I have sat here all day.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I
shall crave your forbearance a little. May be I will call upon
you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
I am always bound to you.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
He hath a garden circummur'd with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
That makes his opening with this bigger key;
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't;
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
No, none, but only a repair i' th' dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me; whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
MARIANA
I do desire the like.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure; but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee. Volumes of report
Run with these false, and most contrarious quest
Upon thy doings. Thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dream,
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
MARIANA
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
MARIANA
Little have you to say,
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Fear me not.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract.
To bring you thus together 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go;
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never cut of a
woman's head.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
Come, sir, leave me your snatches and yield me a direct
answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here
is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a
helper; if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem
you from your gyves; if not, you shall have your full time of
imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for
you have been a notorious bawd.

POMPEY
1
PROVOST
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet
I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to
receive some instructions from my fellow partner.

PROVOST
1
POMPEY
What ho, Abhorson! Where's Abhorson there?

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
PROVOST
Do you call, sir?

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your
execution. If you think it meet, compound with him by the year,
and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present,
and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath
been a bawd.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
PROVOST
A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit our mystery.

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn the
scale.

POMPEY
1
ABHORSON
Pray, sir, by your good favour- for surely, sir, a good
favour you have but that you have a hanging look- do you call,
sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
Ay, sir; a mystery.

POMPEY
1
ABHORSON
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your
whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do
prove my occupation a mystery; but what mystery there should be
in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY
1
ABHORSON
Proof?

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be too
little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it
be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough; so
every true man's apparel fits your thief.

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Are you agreed?

POMPEY
2
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more
penitent trade than your bawd; he doth oftener ask forgiveness.

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe to-morrow
four o'clock.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
PROVOST
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY
2
PROVOST
ABHORSON
I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion
to use me for your own turn, you shall find me yare; for truly,
sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn.

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.
Th' one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.

CLAUDIO
2
POMPEY
PROVOST
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.
He will not wake.

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
CLAUDIO
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself. [Knocking within] But hark, what
Heaven give your spirits comfort!

DUKE
1
PROVOST
The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night
Envelop you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Not Isabel?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
No.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
They will then, ere't be long.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
There's some in hope.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just. [Knocking within] Now are they
This is a gentle provost; seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. [Knocking within]
How now, what noise! That spirit's possess'd with haste
That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in; he is call'd up.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
But he must die to-morrow?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
None, sir, none.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we.
Besides, upon the very siege of justice,
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.

DUKE
2
PROVOST
MESSENGER
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

MESSENGER
2
DUKE
PROVOST
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further
charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it,
neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for
as I take it, it is almost day.

PROVOST
2
DUKE
MESSENGER
I shall obey him.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
[Aside] This is his pardon, purchas'd by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in;
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is borne in high authority.
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended
That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine
office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks
strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Pray you, let's hear.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
[Reads] 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and, in the afternoon,
Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's
head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought
that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not
to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
What say you to this, sir?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th'
afternoon?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
A Bohemian born; but here nurs'd up and bred.
One that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him
to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his
manner to do so.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,
his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to
an undoubted proof.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
It is now apparent?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to
be touch'd?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past,
present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately
mortal.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
He wants advice.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many
times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft
awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a
seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost,
honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill
beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself
in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no
greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To
make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four
days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
a dangerous courtesy.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
In the delaying death.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an
express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view
of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the
smallest.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions
may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,
and his head borne to Angelo.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave
the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the
penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is
common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against
it with my life.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
To him and to his substitutes.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch
the justice of your dealing?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE
2
POMPEY
PROVOST
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you
fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can
with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck
all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of
the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is
not strange to you.

PROVOST
2
POMPEY
DUKE
I know them both.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall
anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within
these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows
not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,
perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some
monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th'
unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into
amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but
easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with
Barnardine's head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise
him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall
absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of
profession; one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own
house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the
Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON

POMPEY
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY
1
ABHORSON
Master Barnardine! You must rise and be hang'd, Master
Barnardine!

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
What ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
there? What are you?

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir,
to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
[ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and
sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Very ready, sir.

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you?

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers;
for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for't.

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
O, the better, sir! For he that drinks all night and is
hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next
day.

ABHORSON
3
POMPEY
DUKE
BARNARDINE
Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father.
Do we jest now, think you?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are
to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with
you.

BARNARDINE
2
DUKE
ABHORSON
Friar, not I; I have been drinking hard all night, and
I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my
brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that's
certain.

DUKE
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
O, Sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE
1
DUKE
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.

DUKE
1
BARNARDINE
But hear you-

BARNARDINE
1
DUKE
Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to
my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE
0
Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
A creature unprepar'd, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclin'd,
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo. See this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon;
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Let this be done:
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio.
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
I am your free dependant.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo-
The Provost, he shall bear them- whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly. Him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount,
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanc'd form.
We shall proceed with Angelo.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
I'll make all speed.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
[ Within ] Peace, ho, be here!

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither;
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Ho, by your leave!

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world.
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
It is no other.
Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience,

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity.
The Duke comes home to-morrow. Nay, dry your eyes.
One of our covent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I am directed by you.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow,
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Good even. Friar, where's the Provost?

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Not within, sir.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had
lived.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;
but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a
better woodman than thou tak'st him for.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty
tales of the Duke.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be
true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would
else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy
talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a
kind of burr; I shall stick.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
like to madness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted! And why
meet him at the gates, and redeliver our authorities there?

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I guess not.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
ent'ring that, if any crave redress of injustice, they should
exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
shall then have no power to stand against us.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaim'd;
Betimes i' th' morn I'll call you at your house;
Give notice to such men of sort and suit
As are to meet him.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I shall, sir; fare you well.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
Good night.

ANGELO
0
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflow'red maid!
And by an eminent body that enforc'd
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears a so credent bulk
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have liv'd,
Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had liv'd!
Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.

DUKE
0
These letters at fit time deliver me.   [Giving letters]
The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
As cause doth minister. Go, call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.
PETER. It shall be speeded well.

DUKE
0
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste.
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius!

ISABELLA
1
MARIANA
To speak so indirectly I am loath;
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part. Yet I am advis'd to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA
1
ISABELLA
Be rul'd by him.

ISABELLA
1
MARIANA
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA
1
ISABELLA
I would Friar Peter-

ISABELLA
2
PETER
MARIANA
O, peace! the friar is come.

PETER
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The Duke is ent'ring; therefore, hence, away.

DUKE
1
ANGELO
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

DUKE
1
ANGELO
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you, and we hear
Such goodness of your justice that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO
1
DUKE
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE
1
ANGELO
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand,
And good supporters are you.

PETER
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
DUKE
PETER
Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd- I would fain have said a maid!
O worthy Prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint,
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
ISABELLA
PETER
Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice;
Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
DUKE
PETER
O worthy Duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil!
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believ'd,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here!

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother,
Cut off by course of justice-

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
DUKE
By course of justice!

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
Is it not strange and strange?

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ISABELLA
Nay, it is ten times strange.

ISABELLA
2
ANGELO
DUKE
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange;
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To th' end of reck'ning.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Away with her. Poor soul,
She speaks this in th' infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
O Prince! I conjure thee, as thou believ'st
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness. Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
By mine honesty,
If she be mad, as I believe no other,
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
O gracious Duke,
Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger-

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
That's I, an't like your Grace.
I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
DUKE
That's he, indeed.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
I wish you now, then;
Pray you take note of it; and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
I warrant your honour.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
LUCIO
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Right.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
LUCIO
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Mended again. The matter- proceed.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
In brief- to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,
For this was of much length- the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
This is most likely!

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
O that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou cam'st here to complain.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience; and, with ripened time,
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
LUCIO
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO
3
DUKE
ISABELLA
PETER
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar.
I do not like the man; had he been lay, my lord,
For certain words he spake against your Grace
In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly.

DUKE
3
LUCIO
ISABELLA
PETER
Words against me? This's a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
PETER
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

PETER
2
LUCIO
DUKE
Blessed be your royal Grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
PETER
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

PETER
2
DUKE
LUCIO
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
PETER
My lord, most villainously; believe it.

PETER
2
LUCIO
DUKE
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request-
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he, with his oath
And all probation, will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman-
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accus'd-
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
PETER
Good friar, let's hear it.

MARIANA
2
DUKE
PETER
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.

DUKE
2
PETER
MARIANA
What, are you married?

MARIANA
1
DUKE
No, my lord.

DUKE
1
MARIANA
Are you a maid?

MARIANA
1
DUKE
No, my lord.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
MARIANA
A widow, then?

MARIANA
2
DUKE
LUCIO
Neither, my lord.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
MARIANA
Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
MARIANA
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither
maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
MARIANA
Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
MARIANA
Well, my lord.

MARIANA
2
LUCIO
DUKE
My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married,
And I confess, besides, I am no maid.
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
MARIANA
He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
MARIANA
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

LUCIO
2
DUKE
MARIANA
Well, my lord.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
MARIANA
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA
3
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
Now I come to't, my lord:
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,
With all th' effect of love.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
MARIANA
Charges she moe than me?

MARIANA
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Not that I know.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
MARIANA
No? You say your husband.

MARIANA
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
MARIANA
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA
3
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagin'd person.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
MARIANA
Know you this woman?

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
DUKE
MARIANA
Carnally, she says.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
MARIANA
Sirrah, no more.

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
DUKE
MARIANA
Enough, my lord.

ANGELO
3
LUCIO
MARIANA
DUKE
My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition; but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity. Since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
DUKE
Noble Prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house,
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO
4
LUCIO
PETER
MARIANA
DUKE
I did but smile till now.
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,
To find this practice out.

DUKE
4
ANGELO
PETER
ESCALUS
MARIANA
Ay, with my heart;
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit,
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

PETER
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
Would lie were here, my lord! For he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint.
Your provost knows the place where he abides,
And he may fetch him.

DUKE
4
ANGELO
LUCIO
PETER
ESCALUS
Go, do it instantly.

ESCALUS
3
DUKE
PETER
LUCIO
My lord, we'll do it throughly.

LUCIO
1
ESCALUS
'Cucullus non facit monachum': honest in nothing but in his
clothes; and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the
Duke.

ESCALUS
1
LUCIO
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable
fellow.

LUCIO
1
ESCALUS
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS
1
LUCIO
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with
her. [

LUCIO
1
ESCALUS
Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS
1
LUCIO
Say you?

LUCIO
1
ESCALUS
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would
sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.

ESCALUS
1
LUCIO
I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO
1
ESCALUS
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALUS
1
LUCIO
Come on, mistress; here's a gentlewoman denies all that
you have said.

LUCIO
1
ESCALUS
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the
Provost.

ESCALUS
2
LUCIO
DUKE
In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon
you.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
Mum.

ESCALUS
2
LUCIO
DUKE
Come, sir; did you set these women on to slander Lord
Angelo? They have confess'd you did.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ESCALUS
'Tis false.

ESCALUS
2
DUKE
LUCIO
How! Know you where you are?

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ESCALUS
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS
2
DUKE
LUCIO
The Duke's in us; and we will hear you speak;
Look you speak justly.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
ESCALUS
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox,
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
DUKE
Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain; and then to glance from him
To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What, 'unjust'!

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
ESCALUS
Be not so hot; the Duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own; his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS
3
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO
3
DUKE
ESCALUS
LUCIO
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, good-man bald-pate.
Do you know me?

DUKE
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at
the prison, in the absence of the Duke.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
DUKE
O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and
a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my
report; you, indeed, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
DUKE
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for
thy speeches?

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
ESCALUS
I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.

ANGELO
3
DUKE
ESCALUS
LUCIO
Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable
abuses!

ESCALUS
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal. Away with him to
prison! Where is the Provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts
enough upon him; let him speak no more. Away with those giglets
too, and with the other confederate companion!

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
ESCALUS
Stay, sir; stay awhile.

ANGELO
3
DUKE
ESCALUS
LUCIO
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated lying rascal, you must be hooded, must you? Show your
knave's visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face,
and be hang'd an hour! Will't not off?

DUKE
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
Thou art the first knave that e'er mad'st a duke.
First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three.
[To Lucio] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO
2
ANGELO
DUKE
This may prove worse than hanging.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
LUCIO
[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down.
We'll borrow place of him. [To ANGELO] Sir, by your leave.
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
LUCIO
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good Prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession;
Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,
Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
ESCALUS
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
I was, my lord.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
ESCALUS
ISABELLA
Go, take her hence and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, Provost.

ESCALUS
3
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
My lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
ESCALUS
ISABELLA
Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince. As I was then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty.

DUKE
3
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
MARIANA
You are pardon'd, Isabel.
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
MARIANA
I do, my lord.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well-defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother-
Being criminal in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach,
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

MARIANA
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life,
And choke your good to come. For his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal
To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA
1
DUKE
O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.

DUKE
1
MARIANA
Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA
1
DUKE
Gentle my liege-                           [Kneeling]

DUKE
1
MARIANA
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death! [To LUCIO] Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA
1
DUKE
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
Against all sense you do importune her.
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

MARIANA
2
DUKE
ISABELLA
Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say best men moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad; so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE
2
ISABELLA
MARIANA
He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA
2
DUKE
MARIANA
[Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
Till he did look on me; since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died;
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.

MARIANA
3
DUKE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Merely, my lord.

DUKE
3
PROVOST
ISABELLA
MARIANA
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

PROVOST
2
DUKE
MARIANA
It was commanded so.

DUKE
2
PROVOST
MARIANA
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

PROVOST
1
DUKE
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE
1
PROVOST
For which I do discharge you of your office;
Give up your keys.

PROVOST
1
DUKE
Pardon me, noble lord;
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserv'd alive.

DUKE
2
PROVOST
ESCALUS
What's he?

PROVOST
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
His name is Barnardine.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ESCALUS
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

ESCALUS
2
ANGELO
DUKE
I am sorry one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ESCALUS
Which is that Barnardine?

PROVOST
2
ANGELO
DUKE
This, my lord.

DUKE
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd;
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffl'd fellow's that?

PROVOST
2
DUKE
LUCIO
This is another prisoner that I sav'd,
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.    [Unmuffles CLAUDIO]

DUKE
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
[To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman!
Wherein have I so deserv'd of you
That you extol me thus?

LUCIO
2
DUKE
PROVOST
Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick.
If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would
please you I might be whipt.

DUKE
2
LUCIO
PROVOST
Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.
Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,
If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow-
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your
Highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not
recompense me in making me a cuckold.

DUKE
1
LUCIO
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO
1
DUKE
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping,
and hanging.
