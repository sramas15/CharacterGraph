YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?

Resolv'd, resolv'd.

First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
people.

We know't, we know't.

Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own

No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!

SECOND CITIZEN

One word, good citizens.

FIRST CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN
ALL
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield
us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess
they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The
leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a
gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
thirst for revenge.

SECOND CITIZEN

ALL

Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

FIRST CITIZEN

Against him first; he's a very dog to the
commonalty.

SECOND CITIZEN

FIRST CITIZEN
Consider you what services he has done for his
country?

FIRST CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN
Very well, and could be content to give him good
report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.

SECOND CITIZEN
1
FIRST CITIZEN
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

FIRST CITIZEN
2
SECOND CITIZEN
ALL
I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it
to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it
was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be
partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.

What he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts

What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.

FIRST CITIZEN

MENENIUS
SECOND CITIZEN
Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll
show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;
they shall know we have strong arms too.

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
We cannot, sir; we are undone already.

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state; whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you; and you slander
The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us
yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with
grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily
any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the
wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear
us.

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale't a little more.

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-
For look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak- it tauntingly replied
To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Your belly's answer- What?
The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
With other muniments and petty helps
Is this our fabric, if that they-

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
What then?
Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Who is the sink o' th' body-

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
Well, what then?

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
I will tell you;
If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-
Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Y'are long about it.

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
Note me this, good friend:
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the storehouse and the shop
Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live. And though that all at once
You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
It was an answer. How apply you this?

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for, examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you,
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly?

FIRST CITIZEN
1
MENENIUS
I the great toe? Why the great toe?

MENENIUS
1
FIRST CITIZEN
For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side must have bale.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
FIRST CITIZEN
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

FIRST CITIZEN
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
FIRST CITIZEN
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
With every minute you do change a mind
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble Senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS
2
MARCIUS
FIRST CITIZEN
For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
The city is well stor'd.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
FIRST CITIZEN
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out
Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS
1
MARCIUS
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?

MARCIUS
1
MENENIUS
They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them- a strange one,
To break the heart of generosity
And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS
1
MARCIUS
What is granted them?

MARCIUS
1
MENENIUS
Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS
1
MARCIUS
This is strange.

MARCIUS

MENENIUS
Go get you home, you fragments.

The Volsces are in arms.

COMINIUS

They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
I sin in envying his nobility;
And were I anything but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS

MARCIUS

You have fought together?

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS

Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he
Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
Only my wars with him. He is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

COMINIUS
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS

Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?

LARTIUS

No, Caius Marcius;

The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,

Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS

He has no equal.

SICINIUS

MARCIUS
BRUTUS
When we were chosen tribunes for the people-

BRUTUS

SICINIUS
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Nay, but his taunts!

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Bemock the modest moon.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
The present wars devour him! He is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Fame, at the which he aims-
In whom already he is well grac'd- cannot
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first; for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS
2
FIRST SENATOR
SICINIUS
Come.
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS
2
BRUTUS
FIRST SENATOR
Let's hence and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.

BRUTUS
2
FIRST SENATOR
SICINIUS
Let's along.

FIRST SENATOR
1
AUFIDIUS
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS
2
SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think
I have the letter here;.yes, here it is:
[Reads]  'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;
Consider of it.'

FIRST SENATOR
2
SECOND SENATOR
AUFIDIUS
Our army's in the field;
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS
2
SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery
We shall be short'ned in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

SECOND SENATOR
2
AUFIDIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
Let us alone to guard Corioli.
If they set down before's, for the remove
Bring up your army; but I think you'll find
Th' have not prepar'd for us.

AUFIDIUS
2
SECOND SENATOR
FIRST SENATOR
O, doubt not that!
I speak from certainties. Nay more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

VOLUMNIA

VIRGILIA
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier
rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet
he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth
with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her
beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person-
that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if
renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I
sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than
now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.

VIRGILIA
1
VOLUMNIA
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?

VOLUMNIA
1
VIRGILIA
Then his good report should have been my son; I therein
would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

GENTLEWOMAN

VIRGILIA

Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA
2
VOLUMNIA
GENTLEWOMAN
Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA
2
VIRGILIA
GENTLEWOMAN
Indeed you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;
See him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair;
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA
2
VOLUMNIA
GENTLEWOMAN
His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA
1
VIRGILIA
Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria
We are fit to bid her welcome.

VIRGILIA
1
VOLUMNIA
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA
1
VIRGILIA
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.

I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA

VIRGILIA

How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are
you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little
son?

VIRGILIA
2
VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA
2
VALERIA
VIRGILIA
He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look
upon his schoolmaster.

VALERIA
2
VIRGILIA
VOLUMNIA
O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very
pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run
after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go
again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up
again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how
'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he
mammock'd it!

VOLUMNIA

VALERIA
VIRGILIA
One on's father's moods.

Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
idle huswife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA

VOLUMNIA
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA

VIRGILIA
VOLUMNIA
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA

VALERIA
VIRGILIA
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA

VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA
2
VIRGILIA
VOLUMNIA
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you
must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA
2
VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA
2
VALERIA
VIRGILIA
Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA
2
VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA
2
VIRGILIA
VOLUMNIA
You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you
might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA
2
VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.

VALERIA
1
VIRGILIA
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
of your husband.

VIRGILIA
1
VALERIA
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA
1
VIRGILIA
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
last night.

VIRGILIA
2
VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA
2
VIRGILIA
VOLUMNIA
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and
Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they
nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA
2
VALERIA
VOLUMNIA
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
hereafter.

VOLUMNIA

VALERIA
VIRGILIA
Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease
our better mirth.

VALERIA

VIRGILIA

In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
door and go along with us.

VALERIA
MARCIUS

No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much

I'll buy him of you.

No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

LARTIUS
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.

MARCIUS

LARTIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

FIRST SENATOR

MARCIUS
LARTIUS
No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
That's lesser than a little.  [Drum afar off]  Hark, our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!
There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS

LARTIUS
FIRST SENATOR
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS

MARCIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIUS
2
LARTIUS
FIRST SENATOR
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus.
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.

MARCIUS
2
LARTIUS
FIRST SENATOR
All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Farther than seen, and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;
If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches. Follow me.

MARCIUS

LARTIUS
FIRST SENATOR
So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.

Slain, sir, doubtless.

LARTIUS
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their gates. He is himself alone,
To answer all the city.

LARTIUS

FIRST SOLDIER
ALL
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.

FIRST SOLDIER

Look, sir.

MARCIUS

LARTIUS
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been too violent
For a second course of fight.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS

MARCIUS
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!

Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.

Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' th' town,
Where they shall know our mind. Away!

COMINIUS

Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring,
May give you thankful sacrifice!

MESSENGER

COMINIUS
The citizens of Corioli have issued
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

COMINIUS
1
MESSENGER
Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?

MESSENGER
1
COMINIUS
Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS
1
MESSENGER
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?

MESSENGER
1
COMINIUS
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel
Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Who's yonder
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
Come I too late?

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
Come I too late?

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
O! let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Flower of warriors,
How is't with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death and some to exile;
Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? Call him hither.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
Let him alone;
He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought, and did
Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
How lies their battle? Know you on which side
They have plac'd their men of trust?

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,
We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here-
As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.           [They all shout and wave their
O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? None of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclin'd.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
March on, my fellows;
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.

LARTIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
For a short holding. If we lose the field
We cannot keep the town.

LIEUTENANT
1
LARTIUS
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS
1
AUFIDIUS
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS
1
AUFIDIUS
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
If I fly, Marcius,
Halloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS
1
AUFIDIUS
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to th' highest.

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.

AUFIDIUS
1
MARCIUS
Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me
In your condemned seconds.

COMINIUS

If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully din'd before.

LARTIUS
1
COMINIUS
O General,
Here is the steed, we the caparison.
Hadst thou beheld-

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
Pray now, no more; my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd
As you have been- that's for my country.
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings and to silence that
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,
In sign of what you are, not to reward
What you have done, before our army hear me.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves rememb'red.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth
Before the common distribution at
Your only choice.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
I thank you, General,
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.

MARCIUS
1
COMINIUS
May these same instruments which you profane
Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-fac'd soothing. When steel grows
Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made
An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,
Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note
Here's many else have done, you shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical,
As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
In praises sauc'd with lies.

COMINIUS
1
MARCIUS
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly. By your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, can him
With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,
Caius Marcius Coriolanus.
Bear th' addition nobly ever!

ALL

COMINIUS
MARCIUS
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

MARCIUS

ALL
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you;
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To th' fairness of my power.

COMINIUS
3
ALL
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS

COMINIUS
MARCIUS
I shall, my lord.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my Lord General.

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS

Marcius, his name?

By Jupiter, forgot!
I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
Have we no wine here?

Go we to our tent.
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to. Come.

AUFIDIUS

FIRST SOLDIER
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
What good condition can a treaty find
I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By th' elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
Or wrath or craft may get him.

FIRST SOLDIER
1
AUFIDIUS
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS
1
FIRST SOLDIER
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suff'ring stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;
Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

FIRST SOLDIER

AUFIDIUS
Will not you go?

AUFIDIUS

I am attended at the cypress grove; I pray you-
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
in abundance?

BRUTUS

He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
SICINIUS
And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS

This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured
here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you?

BOTH TRIBUNES
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Why, how are we censur'd?

MENENIUS
2
BOTH TRIBUNES
BRUTUS
Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?

BOTH TRIBUNES
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS
2
BOTH TRIBUNES
BRUTUS
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your
dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the
least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame
Marcius for being proud?

BRUTUS
2
BOTH TRIBUNES
MENENIUS
We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS
3
BOTH TRIBUNES
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are
many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your
abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of
pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
that you could!

BOTH TRIBUNES
3
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What then, sir?

MENENIUS
3
BOTH TRIBUNES
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.

SICINIUS
3
BOTH TRIBUNES
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS
3
BOTH TRIBUNES
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves
a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you
Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I
make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have
deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with
the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to
bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie
deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the
map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too?
What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
character, if I be known well enough too?

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are
ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good
wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and
a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter
between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the
colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag
against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss
the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All
the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS
1
MENENIUS
Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS
1
BRUTUS
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak
best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your
beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a
cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;
though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation
would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.

VIRGILIA

A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'
health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The
most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to
this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.

All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers,
And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS

COMINIUS

On the sudden
I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS

COMINIUS
SICINIUS
Then our office may
During his power go sleep.

SICINIUS

He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS

In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS

BRUTUS
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours; which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
'Tis right.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
In execution.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
'Tis most like he will.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
It shall be to him then as our good wills:
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.

Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for
consulships?

SECOND OFFICER

FIRST OFFICER
Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it.

FIRST OFFICER

SECOND OFFICER
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and
loves not the common people.

SECOND OFFICER
1
FIRST OFFICER
Faith, there have been many great men that have
flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many
that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they
love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.
Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
see't.

FIRST OFFICER
1
SECOND OFFICER
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;
but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to
flatter them for their love.

SECOND OFFICER
1
FIRST OFFICER
He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been
supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further
deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but
he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise
were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof
and rebuke from every car that heard it.

No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they

Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-
That's thousand to one good one- when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
FIRST SENATOR
I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue and
Most dignifies the haver. If it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him; he bestrid
An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say
I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red
The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.
When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd
Both field and city ours he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Worthy man!

FIRST SENATOR
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world. He covets less
Than misery itself would give, rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
FIRST SENATOR
He's right noble;
Let him be call'd for.

For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you

We may, sir, if we will.

THIRD CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN
FIRST CITIZEN
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds
and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those
wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we
must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should
bring ourselves to be monstrous members.

FIRST CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN

And to make us no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
not to call us the many-headed multitude.

THIRD CITIZEN
2
SECOND CITIZEN
FIRST CITIZEN
We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our
wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits
were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north,
south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
all the points o' th' compass.

Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?

THIRD CITIZEN

will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
liberty 'twould sure southward.

Why that way?

conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.
We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he
stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his
requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues;
therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him.

You should account me the more virtuous, that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn
brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their
choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That
is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I

Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through:
The one part suffered, the other will I do.

Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices?

You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice. Remains
That, in th' official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the Senate.

MARCIUS

MENENIUS
ALL
SICINIUS
Is this done?

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
MARCIUS
The custom of request you have discharg'd.
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

MARCIUS

MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Where? At the Senate House?

SICINIUS

MARCIUS
There, Coriolanus.

MARCIUS

MENENIUS

May I change these garments?

SICINIUS

MENENIUS

You may, sir.

MARCIUS

MENENIUS

That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
Repair to th' Senate House.

Fare you well.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
FIRST CITIZEN
BRUTUS
He has it now; and by his looks methinks
'Tis warm at's heart.

BRUTUS
2
FIRST CITIZEN
SICINIUS
With a proud heart he wore
His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?

SICINIUS
2
FIRST CITIZEN

How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?

FIRST CITIZEN

He has our voices, sir.

We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

SECOND CITIZEN

FIRST CITIZEN
BRUTUS
THIRD CITIZEN
Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

THIRD CITIZEN
3
SECOND CITIZEN
FIRST CITIZEN
BRUTUS
Certainly;
He flouted us downright.

FIRST CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN
THIRD CITIZEN

No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.

SECOND CITIZEN
4
ALL
FIRST CITIZEN
THIRD CITIZEN
SICINIUS
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.

SICINIUS

SECOND CITIZEN
FIRST CITIZEN
ALL
THIRD CITIZEN
Why, so he did, I am sure.

ALL

SECOND CITIZEN
THIRD CITIZEN
SICINIUS
No, no; no man saw 'em.

THIRD CITIZEN
3
ALL
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
He said he had wounds which he could show in
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom
But by your voices will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you,
Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS
3
ALL
BRUTUS
THIRD CITIZEN
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?

BRUTUS
2
THIRD CITIZEN
SICINIUS
Could you not have told him-
As you were lesson'd- when he had no power
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy; ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices, and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS
2
BRUTUS
THIRD CITIZEN
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS
2
THIRD CITIZEN
SICINIUS
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves; and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS
2
BRUTUS
THIRD CITIZEN
Have you
Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
Your su'd-for tongues?

THIRD CITIZEN
3
FIRST CITIZEN
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.

SECOND CITIZENS
4
FIRST CITIZEN
BRUTUS
THIRD CITIZEN
SICINIUS
And will deny him;
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

FIRST CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZENS
BRUTUS
THIRD CITIZEN
SICINIUS
I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece
'em.

BRUTUS
3
SECOND CITIZENS
FIRST CITIZEN
SICINIUS
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties, make them of no more voice
Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS
2
FIRST CITIZEN
BRUTUS
Let them assemble;
And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
Th' apprehension of his present portance,
Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS
2
FIRST CITIZEN
SICINIUS
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
Say you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections; and that your minds,
Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued; and what stock he springs of-
The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our best water brought by conduits hither;
And Censorinus, nobly named so,
Twice being by the people chosen censor,
Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS
1
BRUTUS
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances; but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

BRUTUS
1
SICINIUS
Say you ne'er had done't-
Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to th' Capitol.

CITIZENS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
will will so; almost all
Repent in their election.

BRUTUS
2
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard
Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS
2
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
To th' Capitol, come.
We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?

LARTIUS
2
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
Our swifter composition.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
Upon's again.

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
LARTIUS
They are worn, Lord Consul, so
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS
2
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
LARTIUS
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
He did, my lord.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
How? What?

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS
1
MARCIUS
At Antium.

MARCIUS
1
LARTIUS
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.

MARCIUS
3
LARTIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS
2
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
Pass no further.

MARCIUS
4
MENENIUS
LARTIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Ha! What is that?

BRUTUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
It will be dangerous to go on- no further.

MARCIUS
4
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What makes this change?

MENENIUS
3
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
The matter?

COMINIUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS
4
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Cominius, no.

MARCIUS

COMINIUS
BRUTUS
FIRST SENATOR
Have I had children's voices?

FIRST SENATOR

MARCIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.

BRUTUS

MARCIUS
FIRST SENATOR
SICINIUS
The people are incens'd against him.

SICINIUS
4
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
FIRST SENATOR
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS
3
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Be calm, be calm.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility;
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be rul'd.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
Call't not a plot.
The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS
2
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
Not to them all.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS
2
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
How? I inform them!

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS
3
COMINIUS
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
Not unlike
Each way to better yours.

MARCIUS
4
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS
4
MARCIUS
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
You show too much of that
For which the people stir; if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS
3
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' th' plain way of his merit.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again-

MENENIUS
3
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Not now, not now.

FIRST SENATOR
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
Not in this heat, sir, now.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Now, as I live, I will.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves. I say again,
In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS
2
MARCIUS
FIRST SENATOR
Well, no more.

FIRST SENATOR
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
No more words, we beseech you.

MARCIUS
4
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
FIRST SENATOR
SICINIUS
How? no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles
Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS
4
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
FIRST SENATOR
SICINIUS
You speak o' th' people
As if you were a god, to punish; not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS
3
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
What, what? his choler?

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
'Twas from the canon.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power,
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators; and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by th' other.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
Well, on to th' market-place.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd
Sometime in Greece-

MENENIUS
3
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Well, well, no more of that.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
Why shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation
Which they have often made against the Senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the native
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bosom multiplied digest
The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS
2
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
Come, enough.

BRUTUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
Enough, with over measure.

MARCIUS
3
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
No, take more.
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance- it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you-
You that will be less fearful than discreet;
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For th' ill which doth control't.

BRUTUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
Has said enough.

SICINIUS
2
MARCIUS
BRUTUS
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
As traitors do.

MARCIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench? In a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen; in a better hour
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' th' dust.

BRUTUS
2
MARCIUS
SICINIUS
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS

BRUTUS
This a consul? No.

But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear
What they are us'd to bear.

MENENIUS

MENENIUS

PATRICIANS
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.                 [A noise within]
Here's goodly work!

That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

You worthy Tribunes-

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power,
Which he so sets at nought.

So can I name his faults.

SICINIUS

MENENIUS

If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS
2
PLEBEIANS
MENENIUS
Speak briefly, then,
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.

MENENIUS
2
PLEBEIANS
SICINIUS
Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-
Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country
Were to us all that do't and suffer it
A brand to th' end o' th' world.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Merely awry. When he did love his country,
It honour'd him.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
The service of the foot,
Being once gangren'd, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
One word more, one word
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,
Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
If it were so-

SICINIUS

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
FIRST SENATOR
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!

MENENIUS
3
SICINIUS
FIRST SENATOR
BRUTUS
Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
Since 'a could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

FIRST SENATOR

MENENIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Noble Tribunes,
It is the humane way; the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

In our first way.

Pray you let's to him.

MARCIUS

FIRST PATRICIAN
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels;
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight; yet will I still
Be thus to them.

FIRST PATRICIAN
1
MARCIUS
You do the nobler.

MARCIUS
1
FIRST PATRICIAN
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats; to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.

VOLUMNIA

FIRST PATRICIAN
MARCIUS
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on
Before you had worn it out.

MARCIUS

FIRST PATRICIAN
VOLUMNIA
Let go.

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS
You might have been enough the man you are
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd,
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

MARCIUS

Let them hang.

VOLUMNIA

MARCIUS
Ay, and burn too.

You must return and mend it.

Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Cleave in the midst and perish.

VOLUMNIA

MENENIUS

Pray be counsell'd;
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

MENENIUS

MARCIUS
FIRST SENATOR
VOLUMNIA
Well said, noble woman!
Before he should thus stoop to th' herd, but that
The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

MARCIUS

What must I do?

MENENIUS

Repent what you have spoke.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
VOLUMNIA
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me
In peace what each of them by th' other lose
That they combine not there.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
VOLUMNIA
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS
2
MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
A good demand.

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which for your best ends
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour as in war; since that to both
It stands in like request?

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
VOLUMNIA
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To th' people, not by your own instruction,
Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but roted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
I should do so in honour. I am in this
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon 'em
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS
2
MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
Noble lady!
Come, go with us, speak fair; you may salve so,
Not what is dangerous present, but the los
Of what is past.

VOLUMNIA
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
I prithee now, My son,
Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them-
Thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
More learned than the ears- waving thy head,
Which often thus correcting thy-stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling. Or say to them
Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,
In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power and person.

MENENIUS
1
VOLUMNIA
This but done
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA
1
MENENIUS
Prithee now,
Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
VOLUMNIA
I have been i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence; all's in anger.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
VOLUMNIA
Only fair speech.

COMINIUS
3
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA

MENENIUS
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
He must and will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
VOLUMNIA
Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? Must I
With my base tongue give to my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,
And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to th' life.

COMINIUS
2
MARCIUS
VOLUMNIA
Come, come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA
2
COMINIUS
MARCIUS
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast not done before.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
VOLUMNIA
Well, I must do't.
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd,
Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA
2
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me;
But owe thy pride thyself.

MARCIUS
2
COMINIUS
VOLUMNIA
Pray be content.
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' th' way of flattery further.

VOLUMNIA
2
MARCIUS
COMINIUS
Do your will.

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
MARCIUS
Away! The tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

MARCIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go.
Let them accuse me by invention; I
Will answer in mine honour.

MENENIUS

Ay, but mildly.

MARCIUS

Well, mildly be it then- mildly.

Nor check my courage for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

As much as in him lies- from time to time
Envied against the people, seeking means

Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,

Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell. The beast

Where is your ancient courage? You were us'd
To say extremities was the trier of spirits;

That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me

My hazards still have been your solace; and
Believe't not lightly- though I go alone,

YOU had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is

The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make
it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment
of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes
for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature

Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:

MARCIUS

AUFIDIUS
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,
The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country, are requited
But with that surname- a good memory
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,
An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' th' world
I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight
And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee; for I will fight
Against my cank'red country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever followed thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I lov'd the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell the
We have a power on foot, and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me-
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat-
And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'erbeat. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me
Who am prepar'd against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote
To fright them ere destroy. But come in;

broil'd and eaten him too.

FIRST SERVANT

But more of thy news!

THIRD SERVANT
2
FIRST SERVANT
SECOND SERVANT
Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question
asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him.
Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself
with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse.
But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle
and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half
by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all
down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.

SECOND SERVANT
2
THIRD SERVANT
FIRST SERVANT
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

THIRD SERVANT

FIRST SERVANT
SECOND SERVANT
Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst
not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,
whilst he's in directitude.

But when goes this forward?

THIRD SERVANT

Worthy tribunes,

Reports the Volsces with several powers
Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS

AEDILE
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS

The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can;
And three examples of the like hath been
Within my age. But reason with the fellow
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

MESSENGER

BRUTUS
SICINIUS
It is spoke freely out of many mouths-
How probable I do not know- that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians-

COMINIUS

He is their god; he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than Nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow him
Against us brats with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS

Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds; for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even
As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,
And therein show'd fike enemies.

MENENIUS

'Tis true;
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it, I have not the face

MENENIUS

How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' th' city.

COMINIUS
2
BOTH TRIBUNES
MENENIUS
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer. Desperation
Is all the policy, strength, and defence,
That Rome can make against them.

Here comes the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip; as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
If he could burn us all into one coal
We have deserv'd it.

LIEUTENANT
Do they still fly to th' Roman?

LIEUTENANT

AUFIDIUS
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
I cannot help it now,
Unless by using means I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him; yet his nature
In that's no changeling, and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

LIEUTENANT
1
AUFIDIUS
Yet I wish, sir-
I mean, for your particular- you had not
Join'd in commission with him, but either
Had borne the action of yourself, or else
To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
When he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
Whene'er we come to our account.

LIEUTENANT
1
AUFIDIUS
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS
1
LIEUTENANT
All places yield to him ere he sits down,
And the nobility of Rome are his;
The senators and patricians love him too.
The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them, but he could not
Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From th' casque to th' cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these-
As he hath spices of them all- not all,
For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit
To choke it in the utt'rance. So our virtues
Lie in th' interpretation of the time;
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
T' extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS
1
COMINIUS
No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said
Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father;
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him:
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS
1
COMINIUS
Do you hear?

COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Yet one time he did call me by my name.
I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus'
He would not answer to; forbid all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS
1
COMINIUS
Why, so! You have made good work.
A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
To make coals cheap- a noble memory!

COMINIUS
1
MENENIUS
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected; he replied,
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
Very well.
Could he say less?

COMINIUS
2
MENENIUS
SICINIUS
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends; his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt
And still to nose th' offence.

MENENIUS
2
COMINIUS
SICINIUS
For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
COMINIUS
Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS

No; I'll not meddle.

Pray you go to him.

What should I do?

BRUTUS

MENENIUS
SICINIUS
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS
2
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard- what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? Say't be so?

SICINIUS
2
MENENIUS
BRUTUS
Yet your good will
Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
As you intended well.

MENENIUS
3
COMINIUS
BRUTUS
SICINIUS
I'll undertake't;
I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
He was not taken well: he had not din'd;
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request,
And then I'll set upon him.

COMINIUS

SICINIUS
I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions;
So that all hope is vain,
Unless his noble mother and his wife,
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

I tell thee, fellow,
Thy general is my lover. I have been
The book of his good acts whence men have read
His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;
For I have ever verified my friends-
Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fellow,
I must have leave to pass.

virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied
intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame

hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller
in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come
upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;
look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come
to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I
have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to
pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage
thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,
who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.

MARCIUS

This last old man,
Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have-
Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept. To grace him only,
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to; fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to.  [Shout within]  Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod; and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand

Like a dull actor now
I have forgot my part and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,
For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' th' earth;       [Kneels]
Of thy deep duty more impression show

I beseech you, peace!
Or, if you'd ask, remember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me

Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not
T'allay my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing-

May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.

MARCIUS

Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
Making the mother, wife, and child, to see
The son, the husband, and the father, tearing
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy. For how can we,
Alas, how can we for our country pray,
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our comfort in the country. We must find
An evident calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
Must as a foreign recreant be led
With manacles through our streets, or else
Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine; if I can not persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread-
Trust to't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb
That brought thee to this world.

MARCIUS
AUFIDIUS
Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us
As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans
'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son.
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the graces of the gods,
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound to's mother, yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away.
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down. An end;
This is the last. So we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli, and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.
I am hush'd until our city be afire,
And then I'll speak a little.

O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!-
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?

Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

[To the ladies]  Ay, by and by;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you. All the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.

If it be possible for you to displace it with your little

He lov'd his mother dearly.

MENENIUS

SICINIUS
So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now
than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe
grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground
shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in
his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is
finish'd with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but
eternity, and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS
1
MENENIUS
Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS
1
SICINIUS
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother
shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is
milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find. And all this
is 'long of you.

I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits

Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd,

He bow'd his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable, and free.

That I would have spoken of.
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,
Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his, and took some pride
To do myself this wrong. Till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner; and
He wag'd me with his countenance as if
I had been mercenary.

There was it;
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are

And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

Under your great command. You are to know

With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Doth more than counterpoise a full third part

He has betray'd your business and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
I say your city- to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
Counsel o' th' war; but at his nurse's tears
