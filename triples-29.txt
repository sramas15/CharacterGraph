Good day, sir.
PAINTER
0
I am glad y'are well.
POET
0
I have not seen you long; how goes the world?
PAINTER
0
It wears, sir, as it grows.
POET
0
Ay, that's well known.
PAINTER
0
I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
MERCHANT
0
O, 'tis a worthy lord!
JEWELLER
0
Nay, that's most fix'd.
MERCHANT
0
A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,
JEWELLER
0
I have a jewel here-
MERCHANT
0
O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?
JEWELLER
0
If he will touch the estimate. But for that-
POET
0
When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,
MERCHANT
0
[Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.
JEWELLER
0
And rich. Here is a water, look ye.
PAINTER
0
You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
POET
0
A thing slipp'd idly from me.
PAINTER
0
A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
POET
0
Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
PAINTER
0
'Tis a good piece.
POET
0
So 'tis; this comes off well and excellent.
PAINTER
0
Indifferent.
POET
0
Admirable. How this grace
PAINTER
0
It is a pretty mocking of the life.
POET
0
I will say of it
PAINTER
0
How this lord is followed!
POET
0
The senators of Athens- happy man!
PAINTER
0
Look, moe!
POET
0
You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
PAINTER
0
How shall I understand you?
POET
0
I will unbolt to you.
PAINTER
0
I saw them speak together.
POET
0
Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
PAINTER
0
'Tis conceiv'd to scope.
POET
0
Nay, sir, but hear me on.
PAINTER
0
Ay, marry, what of these?
POET
0
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
PAINTER
0
'Tis common.
TIMON
0
Imprison'd is he, say you?
MESSENGER
0
Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt;
TIMON
0
Noble Ventidius! Well.
MESSENGER
0
Your lordship ever binds him.
TIMON
0
Commend me to him; I will send his ransom;

0
All happiness to your honour!                  Exit
OLD ATHENIAN
0
Lord Timon, hear me speak.
TIMON
0
Freely, good father.
OLD ATHENIAN
0
Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.
TIMON
0
I have so; what of him?
OLD ATHENIAN
0
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
TIMON
0
Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
LUCILIUS
0
Here, at your lordship's service.
OLD ATHENIAN
0
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
TIMON
0
Well; what further?
OLD ATHENIAN
0
One only daughter have I, no kin else,
TIMON
0
The man is honest.
OLD ATHENIAN
0
Therefore he will be, Timon.
TIMON
0
Does she love him?
OLD ATHENIAN
0
She is young and apt:
TIMON
0
Love you the maid?
LUCILIUS
0
Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
OLD ATHENIAN
0
If in her marriage my consent be missing,
TIMON
0
How shall she be endow'd,
OLD ATHENIAN
0
Three talents on the present; in future, all.
TIMON
0
This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long;.
OLD ATHENIAN
0
Most noble lord,
TIMON
0
My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.

Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may

0
I thank you; you shall hear from me anon;
PAINTER
0
A piece of painting, which I do beseech
TIMON
0
Painting is welcome.
PAINTER
0
The gods preserve ye!
TIMON
0
Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand;
JEWELLER
0
What, my lord! Dispraise?
TIMON
0
A mere satiety of commendations;
JEWELLER
0
My lord, 'tis rated
TIMON
0
Well mock'd.
MERCHANT
0
No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
TIMON
0
Look who comes here; will you be chid?
JEWELLER
0
We'll bear, with your lordship.
MERCHANT
0
He'll spare none.
TIMON
0
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
APEMANTUS
0
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
TIMON
0
Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st them not.
APEMANTUS
0
Are they not Athenians?
TIMON
0
Yes.
APEMANTUS
0
Then I repent not.
JEWELLER
0
You know me, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.
TIMON
0
Thou art proud, Apemantus.
APEMANTUS
0
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
TIMON
0
Whither art going?
APEMANTUS
0
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
TIMON
0
That's a deed thou't die for.
APEMANTUS
0
Right, if doing nothing be death by th' law.
TIMON
0
How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
The best, for the innocence.
TIMON
0
Wrought he not well that painted it?
APEMANTUS
0
He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's
PAINTER
0
Y'are a dog.
APEMANTUS
0
Thy mother's of my generation; what's she, if I be a dog?
TIMON
0
Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
No; I eat not lords.
TIMON
0
An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.
APEMANTUS
0
O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
TIMON
0
That's a lascivious apprehension.
APEMANTUS
0
So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour.
TIMON
0
How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man
TIMON
0
What dost thou think 'tis worth?
APEMANTUS
0
Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
POET
0
How now, philosopher!
APEMANTUS
0
Thou liest.
POET
0
Art not one?
APEMANTUS
0
Yes.
POET
0
Then I lie not.
APEMANTUS
0
Art not a poet?
POET
0
Yes.
APEMANTUS

Then thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast

0
What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
E'en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.
TIMON
0
What, thyself?
APEMANTUS
0
Ay.
TIMON
0
Wherefore?
APEMANTUS
0
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.- Art not thou a
MERCHANT
0
Ay, Apemantus.
APEMANTUS
0
Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
MERCHANT
0
If traffic do it, the gods do it.
APEMANTUS
0
Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!
TIMON
0
What trumpet's that?
MESSENGER
0
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
TIMON
0
Pray entertain them; give them guide to us.
APEMANTUS

So, so, there!

Sir, you have sav'd my longing, and I feed

Right welcome, sir!

What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
Time to be honest.
FIRST LORD

That time serves still.
APEMANTUS
0
The more accursed thou that still omit'st it.
SECOND LORD
0
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
APEMANTUS
0
Ay; to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
SECOND LORD
0
Fare thee well, fare thee well.
APEMANTUS
0
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
SECOND LORD
0
Why, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
0
Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give

Hang thyself.
APEMANTUS

No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests

Ha! Now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.

May these add to the number that may scald thee!

Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an

We know him for no less, though we are but

Fie, no: do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
SECOND STRANGER

But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago

How?
SECOND STRANGER

I tell you, denied, my lord.
LUCIUS

What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am

See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see
LUCIUS

Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well; commend
SERVILIUS

May it please your honour, my lord hath sent-
LUCIUS
0
Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord:
SERVILIUS
0
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,
LUCIUS
0
I know his lordship is but merry with me;
SERVILIUS
0
But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
LUCIUS
0
Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
SERVILIUS
0
Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.
LUCIUS
0
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such
SERVILIUS
0
Yes, sir, I shall.
LUCIUS
0
I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
FIRST STRANGER

Do you observe this, Hostilius?
SECOND STRANGER
0
Ay, too well.
FIRST STRANGER

Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same

For mine own part,

I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.

I am of your fear for that.
TITUS

I'll show you how t' observe a strange event.
HORTENSIUS

Most true, he does.

And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
HORTENSIUS
1

It is against my heart.
HORTENSIUS

I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness;

One of Lord Timon's men.

No, indeed, he is not.

We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.

Honour, health, and compassion, to the Senate!
FIRST SENATOR

Now, Captain?
ALCIBIADES

I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
FIRST SENATOR

You undergo too strict a paradox,

My lord-

You cannot make gross sins look clear:

My lords, then, under favour, pardon me
SECOND SENATOR

You breathe in vain.

In vain! His service done
FIRST SENATOR
0
What's that?
ALCIBIADES
0
Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service,
SECOND SENATOR
0
He has made too much plenty with 'em.
FIRST SENATOR
0
He dies.
ALCIBIADES
0
Hard fate! He might have died in war.
FIRST SENATOR
0
We are for law: he dies. Urge it no more
ALCIBIADES

Must it be so? It must not be. My lords,
SECOND SENATOR
0
How!
ALCIBIADES
0
Call me to your remembrances.
THIRD SENATOR

What!

I cannot think but your age has forgot me;

The good time of day to you, sir.
SECOND LORD
0
I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
FIRST LORD
0
Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red.
SECOND LORD
0
It should not be, by the persuasion of his new
FIRST LORD
0
I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting,
SECOND LORD
0
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
FIRST LORD
0
I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
SECOND LORD
0
Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
FIRST LORD
0
A thousand pieces.
SECOND LORD
0
A thousand pieces!
FIRST LORD

What of you?
SECOND LORD
0
He sent to me, sir- here he comes.

With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how fare you?

Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.

Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
SECOND LORD
0
My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame that,

Think not on't, sir.

If you had sent but two hours before-

Let it not cumber your better remembrance. [The banquet

How do you? What's the news?
THIRD LORD

Alcibiades is banish'd. Hear you of it?
FIRST AND SECOND LORDS

Alcibiades banish'd!

'Tis so, be sure of it.

How? how?
SECOND LORD
0
I pray you, upon what?
TIMON

My worthy friends, will you draw near?
THIRD LORD
0
I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
SECOND LORD
0
This is the old man still.
THIRD LORD
0
Will't hold? Will't hold?
SECOND LORD

It does; but time will- and so-

I do conceive.

Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip

What does his lordship mean?
SOME OTHER
0
I know not.
TIMON
0
May you a better feast never behold,
TIMON
0
May you a better feast never behold,
    You knot of mouth-friends! Smoke and lukewarm water
    Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
    Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
    Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
                             [Throwing the water in their faces]
    Your reeking villainy. Live loath'd and long,
    Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
    Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
    You fools of fortune, trencher friends, time's flies,
    Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-lacks!
    Of man and beast the infinite malady
    Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
    Soft, take thy physic first; thou too, and thou.
    Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.       [Throws the
                            dishes at them, and drives them out]
    What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast
    Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
    Burn house! Sink Athens! Henceforth hated be
    Of Timon man and all humanity!                          Exit

How now, my lords!
SECOND LORD

Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
THIRD LORD

Push! Did you see my cap?
FOURTH LORD
0
I have lost my gown.
FIRST LORD
0
He's but a mad lord, and nought but humours sways him.
THIRD LORD
0
Did you see my cap?
SECOND LORD
0
Here 'tis.
FOURTH LORD

Here lies my gown.
FIRST LORD
0
Let's make no stay.
SECOND LORD
0
Lord Timon's mad.

I feel't upon my bones.
FOURTH LORD

One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.

0
Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall
FIRST SERVANT
0
Hear you, Master Steward, where's our master?
FLAVIUS
0
Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
FIRST SERVANT
0
Such a house broke!
SECOND SERVANT
0
As we do turn our backs
FLAVIUS
0
All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
THIRD SERVANT
0
Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
FLAVIUS
0
Good fellows all,
TIMON
0
O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
ALCIBIADES
0
What art thou there? Speak.
TIMON
0
A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart
ALCIBIADES
0
What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee
TIMON
0
I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
ALCIBIADES
0
I know thee well;
TIMON
0
I know thee too; and more than that I know thee
PHRYNIA
0
Thy lips rot off!
TIMON
0
I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
ALCIBIADES
0
How came the noble Timon to this change?
TIMON
0
As the moon does, by wanting light to give.
ALCIBIADES
0
Noble Timon,
TIMON
0
None, but to
ALCIBIADES
0
What is it, Timon?
TIMON
0
Promise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not
ALCIBIADES
0
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
TIMON
0
Thou saw'st them when I had prosperity.
ALCIBIADES
0
I see them now; then was a blessed time.
TIMON
0
As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
TIMANDRA
0
Is this th' Athenian minion whom the world
TIMON
0
Art thou Timandra?
TIMANDRA
0
Yes.
TIMON
0
Be a whore still; they love thee not that use thee.
TIMANDRA
0
Hang thee, monster!
ALCIBIADES
0
Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits
TIMON
0
I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone.
ALCIBIADES
0
I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
TIMON
0
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
ALCIBIADES
0
Why, fare thee well;
TIMON
0
Keep it: I cannot eat it.
ALCIBIADES
0
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap-
TIMON
0
War'st thou 'gainst Athens?
ALCIBIADES
0
Ay, Timon, and have cause.
TIMON
0
The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
ALCIBIADES
0
Why me, Timon?
TIMON
0
That by killing of villains
ALCIBIADES
0
Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou givest me,
TIMON
0
Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA
0
Give us some gold, good Timon.
TIMON
0
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA
0
Well, more gold. What then?
TIMON
0
Consumptions sow
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA
0
More counsel with more money, bounteous
TIMON
0
More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
ALCIBIADES
0
Strike up the drum towards Athens. Farewell, Timon;
TIMON
0
If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
ALCIBIADES
0
I never did thee harm.
TIMON
0
Yes, thou spok'st well of me.
ALCIBIADES
0
Call'st thou that harm?
TIMON
0
Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
ALCIBIADES
0
We but offend him. Strike.
TIMON
0
That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
APEMANTUS
0
I was directed hither. Men report
TIMON
0
'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
APEMANTUS
0
This is in thee a nature but infected,
TIMON
0
Were I like thee, I'd throw away myself.
APEMANTUS
0
Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
TIMON
0
A fool of thee. Depart.
APEMANTUS
0
I love thee better now than e'er I did.
TIMON
0
I hate thee worse.
APEMANTUS
0
Why?
TIMON
0
Thou flatter'st misery.
APEMANTUS
0
I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.
TIMON
0
Why dost thou seek me out?
APEMANTUS
0
To vex thee.
TIMON
0
Always a villain's office or a fool's.
APEMANTUS
0
Ay.
TIMON
0
What, a knave too?
APEMANTUS
0
If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
TIMON
0
Not by his breath that is more miserable.
APEMANTUS
0
Art thou proud yet?
TIMON
0
Ay, that I am not thee.
APEMANTUS
0
I, that I was
TIMON
0
I, that I am one now.
APEMANTUS
0
Here! I will mend thy feast.
TIMON
0
First mend my company: take away thyself.
APEMANTUS
0
So I shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine.
TIMON
0
'Tis not well mended so; it is but botch'd.
APEMANTUS
0
What wouldst thou have to Athens?
TIMON
0
Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
APEMANTUS
0
Here is no use for gold.
TIMON
0
The best and truest;
APEMANTUS
0
Where liest a nights, Timon?
TIMON
0
Under that's above me.
APEMANTUS
0
Where my stomach. finds meat; or rather, where I eat it.
TIMON
0
Would poison were obedient, and knew my mind!
APEMANTUS
0
Where wouldst thou send it?
TIMON
0
To sauce thy dishes.
APEMANTUS
0
The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
TIMON
0
On what I hate I feed not.
APEMANTUS
0
Dost hate a medlar?
TIMON
0
Ay, though it look like thee.
APEMANTUS
0
An th' hadst hated medlars sooner, thou shouldst have
TIMON
0
Who, without those means thou talk'st of, didst thou ever
APEMANTUS
0
Myself.
TIMON
0
I understand thee: thou hadst some means to keep a dog.
APEMANTUS
0
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to
TIMON
0
Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves. What
APEMANTUS
0
Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
TIMON
0
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and
APEMANTUS
0
Ay, Timon.
TIMON
0
A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t' attain to!
APEMANTUS
0
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
TIMON
0
How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the
APEMANTUS
0
Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company
TIMON
0
When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
APEMANTUS
0
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
TIMON
0
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
APEMANTUS
0
A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
TIMON
0
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
APEMANTUS
0
There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
TIMON
0
If I name thee.
APEMANTUS
0
I would my tongue could rot them off!
TIMON
0
Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!

Would thou wouldst burst!

Ay.

Have you forgot me, sir?

Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;

Then I know thee not.

The gods are witness,

What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee

No, my most worthy master, in whose breast

As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he

to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that he's
PAINTER
0
Certain. Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had
POET
0
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends?
PAINTER
0
Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again,
POET
0
What have you now to present unto him?
PAINTER
0
Nothing at this time but my visitation; only I will
POET
0
I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that's coming

0
Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' th' time;

Nay, let's seek him;

Hail, worthy Timon!
PAINTER

Our late noble master!
TIMON

Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?

Sir,

Let it go naked: men may see't the better.
PAINTER

He and myself
TIMON
0
Ay, you are honest men.
PAINTER
0
We are hither come to offer you our service.
TIMON
0
Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
BOTH
0
What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
TIMON
0
Y'are honest men. Y'have heard that I have gold;

So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
TIMON
0
Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit

So, so, my lord.

0
Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
FIRST SENATOR
0
The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
TIMON
0
I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
FIRST SENATOR
0
O, forget
SECOND SENATOR
0
They confess
TIMON
0
You witch me in it;
FIRST SENATOR
0
Therefore so please thee to return with us,
SECOND SENATOR
0
And shakes his threat'ning sword
FIRST SENATOR
0
Therefore, Timon-
TIMON
0
Well, sir, I will. Therefore I will, sir, thus:
FLAVIUS
0
Stay not, all's in vain.
TIMON
0
Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
FIRST SENATOR
0
We speak in vain.
TIMON
0
But yet I love my country, and am not
FIRST SENATOR
0
That's well spoke.
TIMON
0
Commend me to my loving countrymen-
FIRST SENATOR
0
These words become your lips as they pass through
SECOND SENATOR
0
And enter in our ears like great triumphers
TIMON
0
Commend me to them,
FIRST SENATOR
0
I like this well; he will return again.
TIMON
0
I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
FLAVIUS
0
Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
TIMON
0
Come not to me again; but say to Athens
FIRST SENATOR
0
His discontents are unremovably
SECOND SENATOR
0
Our hope in him is dead. Let us return
FIRST SENATOR
0
It requires swift foot.                  Exeunt
FIRST SENATOR
0
Thou hast painfully discover'd; are his files
MESSENGER
0
I have spoke the least.
SECOND SENATOR
0
We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.
MESSENGER
0
I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
FIRST SENATOR
0
Here come our brothers.
THIRD SENATOR
0
No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
SOLDIER
0
By all description this should be the place.
ALCIBIADES
0
Sound to this coward and lascivious town
FIRST SENATOR
0
Noble and young,
SECOND SENATOR
0
So did we woo
FIRST SENATOR
0
These walls of ours
SECOND SENATOR
0
Nor are they living
FIRST SENATOR
0
All have not offended;
SECOND SENATOR
0
What thou wilt,
FIRST SENATOR
0
Set but thy foot
SECOND SENATOR
0
Throw thy glove,
ALCIBIADES
0
Then there's my glove;
BOTH
0
'Tis most nobly spoken.
ALCIBIADES
0
Descend, and keep your words.

My noble General, Timon is dead;
