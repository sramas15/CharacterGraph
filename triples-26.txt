Two households, both alike in dignity,

Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
Greg
0
No, for then we should be colliers.
Samp
0
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
Greg
0
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
Samp
0
I strike quickly, being moved.
Greg
0
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
Samp
0
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
Greg
0
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
Samp
0
A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the

That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the

'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are

The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Samp

'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought

The heads of the maids?
Samp
0
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
Greg
0
They must take it in sense that feel it.
Samp

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I

My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
Greg
0
How? turn thy back and run?
Samp
0
Fear me not.
Greg
0
No, marry. I fear thee!
Samp
0
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Greg
0
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
Samp
0
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
Abr
0
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Samp
0
I do bite my thumb, sir.
Abr
0
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Samp
0
[aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
Greg
0
[aside to Sampson] No.
Samp

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
Greg
0
Do you quarrel, sir?
Abr
0
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
Samp
0
But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
Abr
0
No better.
Samp
0
Well, sir.
Greg
0
[aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
Samp
0
Yes, better, sir.
Abr
0
You lie.
Samp
0
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
Ben
0
Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
Tyb
0
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Ben
0
I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
Tyb
0
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
Officer
0
Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
Citizens
0
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
Cap
0
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
Wife
0
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
Cap
0
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
Mon
0
Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
Prince
0
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Mon
0
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Ben
0
Here were the servants of your adversary
Ben
0
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Mon
0
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Ben
0
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Mon
0
I neither know it nor can learn of him
Ben
0
Have you importun'd him by any means?
Mon
0
Both by myself and many other friend;
Ben
0
See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
Mon
0
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
Ben
0
Good morrow, cousin.
Rom
0
Is the day so young?
Ben
0
But new struck nine.
Rom
0
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Ben
0
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Rom
0
Not having that which having makes them short.
Ben
0
In love?
Rom
0
Out-
Ben
0
Of love?
Rom
0
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Ben
0
Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
Rom
0
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Ben
0
No, coz, I rather weep.
Rom
0
Good heart, at what?
Ben
0
At thy good heart's oppression.
Rom
0
Why, such is love's transgression.
Ben
0
Soft! I will go along.
Rom
0
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
Ben
0
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
Rom
0
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Ben
0
Groan? Why, no;
Rom
0
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
Ben
0
I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
Rom
0
A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
Ben
0
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Rom
0
Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
Ben
0
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Rom
0
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
Ben
0
Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
Rom
0
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
Ben
0
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Rom
0
'Tis the way
Ben
0
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
Cap
0
But Montague is bound as well as I,
Par
0
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
Cap
0
But saying o'er what I have said before:
Par
0
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Cap
0
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
Serv
0
Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
Ben
0
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
Rom
0
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
Ben
0
For what, I pray thee?
Rom
0
For your broken shin.
Ben
0
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Rom
0
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Serv
0
God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
Rom
0
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Serv
0
Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you
Rom
0
Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
Serv
0
Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
Rom
0
Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
Serv
0
Up.
Rom
0
Whither?
Serv
0
To supper, to our house.
Rom
0
Whose house?
Serv
0
My master's.
Rom
0
Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
Serv
0
Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich
Ben
0
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Rom
0
When the devout religion of mine eye
Ben
0
Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
Rom
0
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
Wife
0
Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
Nurse
0
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
Jul
0
How now? Who calls?
Nurse
0
Your mother.
Jul
0
Madam, I am here.
Wife
0
This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
Nurse
0
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
Wife
0
She's not fourteen.
Nurse
0
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
Wife
0
A fortnight and odd days.
Nurse
0
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Wife
0
Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
Nurse
0
Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
Jul
0
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Nurse
0
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Wife
0
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
Jul
0
It is an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse
0
An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
Wife
0
Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
Nurse
0
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
Wife
0
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nurse
0
Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
Wife
0
What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
Nurse
0
No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
Wife
0
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Jul
0
I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
Serv
0
Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my
Wife
0
We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
Nurse
0
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Rom
0
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Ben
0
The date is out of such prolixity.
Rom
0
Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
Mer
0
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Rom
0
Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
Mer
0
You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
Rom
0
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
Mer
0
And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
Rom
0
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Mer
0
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
Ben
0
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
Rom
0
A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
Mer
0
Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
Rom
0
Nay, that's not so.
Mer
0
I mean, sir, in delay
Rom
0
And we mean well, in going to this masque;
Mer
0
Why, may one ask?
Rom
0
I dreamt a dream to-night.
Mer
0
And so did I.
Rom
0
Well, what was yours?
Mer
0
That dreamers often lie.
Rom
0
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Mer
0
O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Rom
0
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Mer
0
True, I talk of dreams;
Ben
0
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
Rom
0
I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
Ben
0
Strike, drum.
Cap
0
Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
Cap
0
What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
Cap
0
Will you tell me that?
Rom
0
[to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand
Serv
0
I know not, sir.
Rom
0
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
Tyb
0
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Cap
0
Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
Tyb
0
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
Cap
0
Young Romeo is it?
Tyb
0
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
Cap
0
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
Tyb
0
It fits when such a villain is a guest.
Cap
0
He shall be endur'd.
Tyb
0
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
Cap
0
Go to, go to!
Tyb
0
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Rom
0
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
Jul
0
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Rom
0
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Jul
0
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
Rom
0
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
Jul
0
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Rom
0
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
Jul
0
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Rom
0
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
Jul
0
You kiss by th' book.
Nurse
0
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Rom
0
What is her mother?
Nurse
0
Marry, bachelor,
Rom
0
Is she a Capulet?
Ben
0
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
Rom
0
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Cap
0
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
Jul
0
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Nurse
0
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
Jul
0
What's he that now is going out of door?
Nurse
0
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
Jul
0
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
Nurse
0
I know not.
Jul
0
Go ask his name.- If he be married,
Nurse
0
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
Jul
0
My only love, sprung from my only hate!
Nurse
0
What's this? what's this?
Jul
0
A rhyme I learnt even now
Nurse
0
Anon, anon!
Chor
0
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
Rom
0
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Ben
0
Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
Mer
0
He is wise,
Ben
0
He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
Mer
0
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Ben
0
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
Mer
0
This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
Ben
0
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
Mer
0
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Ben
0
Go then, for 'tis in vain
Rom
0
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
Jul
0
Ay me!
Rom
0
She speaks.
Jul
0
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Rom
0
[aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Jul
0
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Rom
0
I take thee at thy word.
Jul
0
What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
Rom
0
By a name
Jul
0
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Rom
0
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
Jul
0
How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
Rom
0
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
Jul
0
If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
Rom
0
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Jul
0
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
Rom
0
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
Jul
0
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
Rom
0
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
Jul
0
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
Rom
0
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
Jul
0
O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
Rom
0
What shall I swear by?
Jul
0
Do not swear at all;
Rom
0
If my heart's dear love-
Jul
0
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
Rom
0
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Jul
0
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Rom
0
Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Jul
0
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
Rom
0
Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
Jul
0
But to be frank and give it thee again.
Rom
0
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
Jul
0
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Nurse
0
(within) Madam!
Jul
0
I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
Nurse
0
(within) Madam!
Jul
0
By-and-by I come.-
Rom
0
So thrive my soul-
Jul
0
A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
Rom
0
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
Jul
0
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
Rom
0
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
Jul
0
Romeo!
Rom
0
My dear?
Jul
0
At what o'clock to-morrow
Rom
0
By the hour of nine.
Jul
0
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
Rom
0
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Jul
0
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Rom
0
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Jul
0
'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
Rom
0
I would I were thy bird.
Jul
0
Sweet, so would I.
Rom
0
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Friar
0
The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
Rom
0
Good morrow, father.
Friar
0
Benedicite!
Rom
0
That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
Friar
0
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
Rom
0
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
Friar
0
That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
Rom
0
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
Friar
0
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
Rom
0
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
Friar
0
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
Rom
0
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Friar
0
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
Rom
0
And bad'st me bury love.
Friar
0
Not in a grave
Rom
0
I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
Friar
0
O, she knew well
Rom
0
O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
Friar
0
Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
Mer
0
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Ben
0
Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
Mer
0
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Ben
0
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
Mer
0
A challenge, on my life.
Ben
0
Romeo will answer it.
Mer
0
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Ben
0
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being
Mer
0
Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
Ben
0
Why, what is Tybalt?
Mer
0
More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
Ben
0
The what?
Mer
0
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these
Ben
0
Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
Mer
0
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art
Rom
0
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Mer
0
The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
Rom
0
Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
Mer
0
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
Rom
0
Meaning, to cursy.
Mer
0
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Rom
0
A most courteous exposition.
Mer
0
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Rom
0
Pink for flower.
Mer
0
Right.
Rom
0
Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
Mer
0
Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy
Rom
0
O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
Mer
0
Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
Rom
0
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
Mer
0
Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for thou
Rom
0
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there
Mer
0
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
Rom
0
Nay, good goose, bite not!
Mer
0
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
Rom
0
And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
Mer
0
O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
Rom
0
I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to the
Mer
0
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art
Ben
0
Stop there, stop there!
Mer
0
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Ben
0
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Mer
0
O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I was
Rom
0
Here's goodly gear!
Mer
0
A sail, a sail!
Ben
0
Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
Nurse
0
Peter!
Peter
0
Anon.
Nurse
0
My fan, Peter.
Mer
0
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
Nurse
0
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
Mer
0
God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
Nurse
0
Is it good-den?
Mer
0
'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now
Nurse
0
Out upon you! What a man are you!
Rom
0
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
Nurse
0
By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,' quoth
Rom
0
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have
Nurse
0
You say well.
Mer
0
Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
Nurse
0
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
Ben
0
She will endite him to some supper.
Mer
0
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
Rom
0
What hast thou found?
Mer
0
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
Rom
0
I will follow you.
Mer
0
Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
Nurse
0
Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant was
Rom
0
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and will
Nurse
0
An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an 'a
Peter
0
I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my weapon
Nurse
0
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
Rom
0
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
Nurse
0
Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
Rom
0
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
Nurse
0
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take
Rom
0
Bid her devise
Nurse
0
No, truly, sir; not a penny.
Rom
0
Go to! I say you shall.
Nurse
0
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
Rom
0
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Nurse
0
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
Rom
0
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
Nurse
0
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Rom
0
I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
Nurse
0
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
Rom
0
Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
Nurse
0
Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I know
Rom
0
Commend me to thy lady.
Nurse
0
Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
Peter
0
Anon.
Nurse
0
Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
Jul
0
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
Nurse
0
Peter, stay at the gate.
Jul
0
Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Nurse
0
I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
Jul
0
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
Nurse
0
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
Jul
0
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
Nurse
0
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
Jul
0
No, no. But all this did I know before.
Nurse
0
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
Jul
0
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Nurse
0
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
Jul
0
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Nurse
0
O God's Lady dear!

Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Nurse
0
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
Jul
0
I have.
Nurse
0
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
Jul
0
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
Friar
0
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
Rom
0
Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
Friar
0
These violent delights have violent ends
Jul
0
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Friar
0
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
Jul
0
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
Rom
0
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Jul
0
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Friar
0
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
Ben
0
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
Mer
0
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the
Ben
0
Am I like such a fellow?
Mer
0
Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
Ben
0
And what to?
Mer
0
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for
Ben
0
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy
Mer
0
The fee simple? O simple!
Ben
0
By my head, here come the Capulets.
Mer
0
By my heel, I care not.
Tyb
0
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Mer
0
And but one word with one of us?
Tyb
0
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
Mer
0
Could you not take some occasion without giving
Tyb
0
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
Mer
0
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
Ben
0
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Mer
0
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
Tyb
0
Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
Mer
0
But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
Tyb
0
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
Rom
0
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Tyb
0
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
Rom
0
I do protest I never injur'd thee,
Mer
0
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Tyb
0
What wouldst thou have with me?
Mer
0
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. That I
Tyb
0
I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
Rom
0
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
Mer
0
Come, sir, your passado!
Rom
0
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Mer
0
I am hurt.
Ben
0
What, art thou hurt?
Mer
0
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
Rom
0
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
Mer
0
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
Rom
0
I thought all for the best.
Mer
0
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Rom
0
This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
Ben
0
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
Rom
0
This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
Ben
0
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Rom
0
Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Tyb
0
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Rom
0
This shall determine that.
Ben
0
Romeo, away, be gone!
Rom
0
O, I am fortune's fool!
Ben
0
Why dost thou stay?
Citizen
0
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Ben
0
There lies that Tybalt.
Citizen
0
Up, sir, go with me.
Prince
0
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Ben
0
O noble Prince. I can discover all
Cap
0
Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
Prince
0
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Ben
0
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
Cap
0
Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Prince
0
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
Mon
0
Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
Prince
0
And for that offence
Jul
0
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Nurse
0
Ay, ay, the cords.
Jul
0
Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
Nurse
0
Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
Jul
0
Can heaven be so envious?
Nurse
0
Romeo can,
Jul
0
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
Nurse
0
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
Jul
0
O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
Nurse
0
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Jul
0
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Nurse
0
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Jul
0
O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Nurse
0
It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
Jul
0
O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
Nurse
0
There's no trust,
Jul
0
Blister'd be thy tongue
Nurse
0
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
Jul
0
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Nurse
0
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
Jul
0
Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
Nurse
0
Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
Jul
0
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
Friar
0
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Rom
0
Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
Friar
0
Too familiar
Rom
0
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
Friar
0
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
Rom
0
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
Friar
0
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Rom
0
There is no world without Verona walls,
Friar
0
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Rom
0
'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
Friar
0
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
Rom
0
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
Friar
0
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
Rom
0
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Friar
0
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
Rom
0
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Friar
0
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Rom
0
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Friar
0
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
Rom
0
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Friar
0
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Nurse
0
[within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
Friar
0
Welcome then.
Nurse
0
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
Friar
0
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Nurse
0
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Friar
0
O woeful sympathy!
Nurse
0
Even so lies she,
Rom
0
(rises) Nurse-
Nurse
0
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
Rom
0
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Nurse
0
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
Rom
0
As if that name,
Friar
0
Hold thy desperate hand.
Nurse
0
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
Rom
0
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Nurse
0
Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Rom
0
How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
Friar
0
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Rom
0
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
Cap
0
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
Par
0
These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
Lady
0
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
Cap
0
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Par
0
Monday, my lord.
Cap
0
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
Par
0
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
Cap
0
Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
Jul
0
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Rom
0
It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
Jul
0
Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
Rom
0
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
Jul
0
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
Rom
0
More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
Nurse
0
Madam!
Jul
0
Nurse?
Nurse
0
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
Jul
0
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
Rom
0
Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
Jul
0
Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
Rom
0
Farewell!
Jul
0
O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Rom
0
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
Jul
0
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Rom
0
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Jul
0
O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
Lady
0
[within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
Jul
0
Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
Lady
0
Why, how now, Juliet?
Jul
0
Madam, I am not well.
Lady
0
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
Jul
0
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Lady
0
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Jul
0
Feeling so the loss,
Lady
0
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
Jul
0
What villain, madam?
Lady
0
That same villain Romeo.
Jul
0
[aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
Lady
0
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
Jul
0
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Lady
0
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Jul
0
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
Lady
0
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
Jul
0
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
Lady
0
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
Jul
0
Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
Lady
0
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
Jul
0
Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
Lady
0
Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
Cap
0
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
Lady
0
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
Cap
0
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
Jul
0
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Cap
0
How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
Lady
0
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
Jul
0
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Cap
0
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
Nurse
0
God in heaven bless her!
Cap
0
And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
Nurse
0
I speak no treason.
Cap
0
O, God-i-god-en!
Nurse
0
May not one speak?
Cap
0
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Lady
0
You are too hot.
Cap
0
God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
Jul
0
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
Lady
0
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
Jul
0
O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
Nurse
0
Faith, here it is.
Jul
0
Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
Nurse
0
And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
Jul
0
Amen!
Nurse
0
What?
Jul
0
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Nurse
0
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
Jul
0
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Friar
0
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
Par
0
My father Capulet will have it so,
Friar
0
You say you do not know the lady's mind.
Par
0
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
Friar
0
[aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
Par
0
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
Jul
0
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
Par
0
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
Jul
0
What must be shall be.
Friar
0
That's a certain text.
Par
0
Come you to make confession to this father?
Jul
0
To answer that, I should confess to you.
Par
0
Do not deny to him that you love me.
Jul
0
I will confess to you that I love him.
Par
0
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
Jul
0
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Par
0
Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
Jul
0
The tears have got small victory by that,
Par
0
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
Jul
0
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
Par
0
Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
Jul
0
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Friar
0
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
Par
0
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Jul
0
O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Friar
0
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
Jul
0
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Friar
0
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Jul
0
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Friar
0
Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
Jul
0
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
Friar
0
Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Jul
0
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Cap
0
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Serv
0
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick
Cap
0
How canst thou try them so?
Serv
0
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
Cap
0
Go, begone.
Nurse
0
Ay, forsooth.
Cap
0
Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
Nurse
0
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Cap
0
How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
Jul
0
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Cap
0
Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
Jul
0
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
Cap
0
Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
Jul
0
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
Mother
0
No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
Cap
0
Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
Mother
0
We shall be short in our provision.
Cap
0
Tush, I will stir about,
Jul
0
Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
Mother
0
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
Jul
0
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
Mother
0
Good night.
Jul
0
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
Lady
0
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
Nurse
0
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Cap
0
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
Nurse
0
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Cap
0
No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
Lady
0
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
Cap
0
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Fellow
0
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Cap
0
Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
Fellow
0
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
Cap
0
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Nurse
0
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
Mother
0
What noise is here?
Nurse
0
O lamentable day!
Mother
0
What is the matter?
Nurse
0
Look, look! O heavy day!
Mother
0
O me, O me! My child, my only life!
Father
0
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
Nurse
0
She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
Mother
0
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Cap
0
Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
Nurse
0
O lamentable day!
Mother
0
O woful time!
Cap
0
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Friar
0
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Cap
0
Ready to go, but never to return.
Par
0
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
Mother
0
Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Nurse
0
O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
Par
0
Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Cap
0
Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Friar
0
Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
Cap
0
All things that we ordained festival
Friar
0
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
Nurse
0
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!

Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
Pet

O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full

I will then give it you soundly.

No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the

Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
Man

Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Rom
0
Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
Man
0
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
Rom
0
Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
Man
0
No, my good lord.
Rom
0
No matter. Get thee gone
Apoth
0
Who calls so loud?
Rom
0
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
Apoth
0
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Rom
0
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
Apoth
0
My poverty but not my will consents.
Rom
0
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
Apoth
0
Put this in any liquid thing you will
Rom
0
There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
John
0
Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
Laur
0
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
John
0
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
Laur
0
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
John
0
I could not send it- here it is again-
Laur
0
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
John
0
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
Laur
0
Now, must I to the monument alone.
Par
0
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
Page
0
[aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
Par
0
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
Rom
0
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Bal
0
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Rom
0
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
Bal
0
[aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
Rom
0
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Par
0
This is that banish'd haughty Montague
Rom
0
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Par
0
I do defy thy, conjuration
Rom
0
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
Page
0
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
Par
0
O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
Rom
0
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Friar
0
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Bal
0
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Friar
0
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
Bal
0
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
Friar
0
Who is it?
Bal
0
Romeo.
Friar
0
How long hath he been there?
Bal
0
Full half an hour.
Friar
0
Go with me to the vault.
Bal
0
I dare not, sir.
Friar
0
Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
Bal
0
As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
Friar
0
Romeo!
Jul
0
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
Friar
0
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Jul
0
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Chief Watch
0
[within] Lead, boy. Which way?
Boy
0
This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
Chief Watch
0
'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
Chief Watch
0
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
Chief Watch
0
A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
Prince
0
What misadventure is so early up,
Cap
0
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
Wife
0
The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
Prince
0
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Chief Watch
0
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
Prince
0
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
Chief Watch
0
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
Cap
0
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
Wife
0
O me! this sight of death is as a bell
Prince
0
Come, Montague; for thou art early up
Mon
0
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
Prince
0
Look, and thou shalt see.
Mon
0
O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
Prince
0
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Friar
0
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Prince
0
Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
Friar
0
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Prince
0
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Bal
0
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
Prince
0
Give me the letter. I will look on it.
Boy
0
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
Prince
0
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Cap
0
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
Mon
0
But I can give thee more;
Cap
0
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
Prince
0
A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
