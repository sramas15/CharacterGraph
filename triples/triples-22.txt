I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this
night to Messina.

MESSENGER

BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I
left him.

LEONATO

BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
But few of any sort, and none of name.

LEONATO

BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on
a young Florentine called Claudio.

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
Much deserv'd on his part, and equally rememb'red by Don
PEDRO. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing
in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed
better bett'red expectation than you must expect of me to tell
you how.

LEONATO

BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.

MESSENGER

BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much
joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness.

LEONATO

BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
Did he break out into tears?

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
In great measure.

LEONATO
3
BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than
those that are so wash'd. How much better is it to weep at joy
than to joy at weeping!

I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no?

MESSENGER

BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the
army of any sort.

LEONATO
3
BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
What is he that you ask for, niece?

HERO

BEATRICE
MESSENGER
LEONATO
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng'd Cupid at
the flight, and my uncle's fool, reading the challenge,
subscrib'd for Cupid and challeng'd him at the burbolt. I pray
you, how many hath he kill'd and eaten in these wars? But how
many hath he kill'd? For indeed I promised to eat all of his
killing.

LEONATO
3
BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll
be meet with you, I doubt it not.

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a
very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach.

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
And a good soldier too, lady.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff'd with all honourable
virtues.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuff'd man; but for
the stuffing--well, we are all mortal.

LEONATO
3
BEATRICE
MESSENGER
HERO
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry
war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never meet but there's
a skirmish of wit between them.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
Alas, he gets nothing by that! In our last conflict four of
his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern'd
with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let
him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for
it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new
sworn brother.

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
Is't possible?

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion
of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is
his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil?

MESSENGER
3
BEATRICE
LEONATO
HERO
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

BEATRICE
3
MESSENGER
LEONATO
HERO
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner
caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God
help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will
cost him a thousand pound ere 'a be cured.

MESSENGER

BEATRICE

I will hold friends with you, lady.

BEATRICE

I wonder that thou (being, as thou say'st thou art, born
under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when
I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have
stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am drowsy,
and tend on no man's business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no
man in his humour.

CONRADE

JOHN
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against
your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where
it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest.

JOHN
1
CONRADE
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace,
and it better fits my blood to be disdain'd of all than to
fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot
be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but
I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and
enfranchis'd with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in
my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I
would do my liking. In the meantime let me be that I am, and seek
not to alter me.

Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty
room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad
conference. I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed
upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
obtain'd her, give her to Count Claudio.

JOHN

Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my

overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.

The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed

Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a
measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty like
a Scotch jig--and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly
modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace

Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.

I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such
impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark,
with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every
word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to the North
Star. I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that
Adam had left him before he transgress'd. She would have made
Hercules have turn'd spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her. You shall find her the
infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would

it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will

And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know.
Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved
valour, and confirm'd honesty. I will teach you how to humour
your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I,
[to Leonato and Claudio] with your two helps, will so practise on
Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are
the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

JOHN

BORACHIO
It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of
Leonato.

BORACHIO

JOHN
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me.
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his
affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this
marriage?

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me.

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
Show me briefly how.

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in
the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
I remember.

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her
to look out at her lady's chamber window.

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the
Prince your brother; spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio (whose estimation do
you mightily hold up) to a contaminated stale, such a one as
HERO.

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
What proof shall I make of that?

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo
Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
Only to despite them I will endeavour anything.

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
Claudio alone; tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend
a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as--in love of
your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
reputation, who is thus like to be cozen'd with the semblance of
a maid--that you have discover'd thus. They will scarcely believe
this without trial. Offer them instances; which shall bear no
less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me
call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them
to see this the very night before the intended wedding (for in
the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent) and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's
disloyalty that jealousy shall be call'd assurance and all the
preparation overthrown.

JOHN
1
BORACHIO
Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in
practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a
thousand ducats.

BORACHIO
1
JOHN
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not
shame me.

she, 'that have so oft encount'red him with scorn, write to him
that I love him?'"

LEONATO

This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for
she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her
smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us
all.

CLAUDIO
4
PEDRO

Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest
your daughter told us of.

LEONATO
4
PEDRO

O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found
'Benedick' and 'Beatrice' between the sheet?

CLAUDIO
4
PEDRO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
That.

LEONATO
4
PEDRO
CLAUDIO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, rail'd at
herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
knew would flout her. 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own
spirit; for I should flout him if he writ to me. Yea, though I
love him, I should.'

CLAUDIO
4
PEDRO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her
heart, tears her hair, prays, curses--'O sweet Benedick! God give
me patience!'

LEONATO
4
PEDRO
CLAUDIO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
She doth indeed; my daughter says so. And the ecstasy hath so
much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will
do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.

PEDRO

LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she
will not discover it.

CLAUDIO

To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the
poor lady worse.

PEDRO

CLAUDIO
LEONATO

An he should, it were an alms to hang him! She's an
excellent sweet lady, and (out of all suspicion) she is virtuous.

CLAUDIO

And she is exceeding wise.

PEDRO

for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.

PEDRO
4
CLAUDIO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR

I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have
daff'd all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you
tell Benedick of it and hear what 'a will say.

LEONATO
4
PEDRO
CLAUDIO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
Were it good, think you?

CLAUDIO
4
PEDRO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die
if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known,
and she will die, if he woo her, rather than she will bate one
breath of her accustomed crossness.

PEDRO
4
CLAUDIO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, 'tis
very possible he'll scorn it; for the man (as you know all) hath
a contemptible spirit.

CLAUDIO

BALTHASAR
BENEDICK

And I take him to be valiant.

PEDRO

CLAUDIO

As Hector, I assure you; and in the managing of quarrels you
may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great
discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear.

LEONATO
4
PEDRO
CLAUDIO
BALTHASAR

If he do fear God, 'a must necessarily keep peace. If he
break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
trembling.

PEDRO
4
CLAUDIO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it
seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am
sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of
her love?

CLAUDIO
4
PEDRO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
Never tell him, my lord. Let her wear it out with good
counsel.

LEONATO

Nay, that's impossible; she may wear her heart out first.

PEDRO
4
CLAUDIO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR

Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it
cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would
modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a
lady.

If he dote on her upon this, I will never trust my
expectation.

PEDRO
4
CLAUDIO
LEONATO
BALTHASAR
BENEDICK
Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your
daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be, when they
hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter.
That's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb
show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

BENEDICK
4
PEDRO
BALTHASAR
LEONATO
CLAUDIO
This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they
have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady.
It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it
must be requited. I hear how I am censur'd. They say I will bear
myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say too
that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that
hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the
lady is fair--'tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous
--'tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me--by
my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of
her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance
have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I
have railed so long against marriage. But doth not the appetite
alters? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure
in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No, the world
must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not
think I should live till I were married.

Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.'
There's a double meaning in that. 'I took no more pains for those
thanks than you took pains to thank me.' That's as much as to
say, 'Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.' If I
do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I
am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour.
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursley
Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
Is all of her. Say that thou overheard'st us;
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,
Forbid the sun to enter--like favourites,
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her
To listen our propose. This is thy office.
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part

O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But Nature never fram'd a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprizing what they look on; and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endeared.

Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur'd,
But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac'd,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit!
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,

Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your

it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth.
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring, and the little
hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a

There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy

Frenchman to-morrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as
a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this
foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you
would have it appear he is.

Yea, or to paint himself? for the which I hear what they say

Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is new-crept into a

You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your

for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no
need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch. Therefore
bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend
all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince's
name.

him?

DOGBERRY

Truly, by your office you may; but I think they that touch
pitch will be defil'd. The most peaceable way for you, if you do
take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal
out of your company.

Nay, by'r lady, that I think 'a cannot.

DOGBERRY

Five shillings to one on't with any man that knows the
statutes, he may stay him! Marry, not without the Prince be
willing; for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is
an offence to stay a man against his will.

to your heart. It is the only thing for a qualm.

Benedictus? why benedictus? You have some moral in this
'benedictus.'

MARGARET

BEATRICE
HERO
Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant
plain holy thistle. You may think perchance that I think you are
in love. Nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I
list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor indeed I cannot
think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in
love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love.
Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man. He
swore he would never marry; and yet now in despite of his heart
he eats his meat without grudging; and how you may be converted I
know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.

A good old man, sir; he will be talking. As they say, 'When

see! Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges. Well, God's a good
man. An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
soul, i' faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but
God is to be worshipp'd; all men are not alike, alas, good

O, what authority and show of truth
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue, Would you not swear,

Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
Why had I not with charitable hand
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
Who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy,
I might have said, 'No part of it is mine;
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd,
And mine that I was proud on--mine so much
That I myself was to myself not mine,
Valuing of her--why, she, O, she is fall'n

And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
Trust not my reading nor my observation,

Your daughter here the princes left for dead,

Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites

Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse. That is some good.
But not for that dream I on this strange course,
But on this travail look for greater birth.
She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
Upon the instant that she was accus'd,
Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus'd
Of every hearer; for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio.
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
Th' idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
More moving, delicate, and full of life,
Into the eye and prospect of his soul
Than when she liv'd indeed. Then shall he mourn
(If ever love had interest in his liver)
And wish he had not so accused her--
No, though be thought his accusation true.
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
The supposition of the lady's death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy.
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
As best befits her wounded reputation,
In some reclusive and religious life,
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.

If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
Against yourself.

LEONATO

ANTONIO
I pray thee cease thy counsel,
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so lov'd his child,
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
And bid him speak to me of patience.
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,
And let it answer every strain for strain,
As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan,
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
With candle-wasters--bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man; for, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion, which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air and agony with words.
No, no! 'Tis all men's office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel.
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

ANTONIO

LEONATO

For there was never yet philosopher

And made a push at chance and sufferance.

Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.
Make those that do offend you suffer too.

LEONATO

And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,
And all of them that thus dishonour her.

Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
And she lied buried with her ancestors-
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
Save this of hers, fram'd by thy villany!

But that's no matter; let him kill one first.
Win me and wear me! Let him answer me.
Come, follow me, boy,. Come, sir boy, come follow me.

LEONATO
CLAUDIO
PEDRO
Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.

PEDRO
3
LEONATO
CLAUDIO
BENEDICK
I'll tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day. I
said thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,' said she, 'a fine little
one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.' 'Right,' says she, 'a great
gross one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit.' 'Just,' said she, 'it
hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise.' 'Certain,'
said she, a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the
tongues.' 'That I believe' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me
on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning. There's a
double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus did she an hour
together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at last she
concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper'st man in Italy.

CLAUDIO
3
LEONATO
PEDRO
BENEDICK
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.

PEDRO
3
LEONATO
CLAUDIO
BENEDICK
Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not
hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's
daughter told us all.

CLAUDIO
3
LEONATO
PEDRO
BENEDICK
All, all! and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the
garden.

PEDRO
3
LEONATO
CLAUDIO
BENEDICK
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the
sensible Benedick's head?

CLAUDIO
3
LEONATO
PEDRO
BENEDICK
Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick, the married
man'?

BENEDICK
3
LEONATO
CLAUDIO
PEDRO
Fare you well, boy; you know my mind. I will leave you now to
your gossiplike humour. You break jests as braggards do their
blades, which God be thanked hurt not. My lord, for your many
courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your
brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you
kill'd a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he
and I shall meet; and till then peace be with him.

PEDRO
3
LEONATO
CLAUDIO
BENEDICK
He is in earnest.

CLAUDIO
3
LEONATO
PEDRO
BENEDICK
In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the
love of Beatrice.

very eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow
fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me
confessing to this man, how Don John your brother incensed me to
slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and
saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments; how you disgrac'd her
when you should marry her. My villany they have upon record,
which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false
accusation; and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a
villain.

over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in
rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby'

for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?

conscience) find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet
of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising
myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now
