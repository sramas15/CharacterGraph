ESCALUS
Escalus!

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
My lord.

DUKE
1
ESCALUS
Of government the properties to unfold
Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse,
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you; then no more remains
But that to your sufficiency- as your worth is able-
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, y'are as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us, Angelo.

ESCALUS
1
DUKE
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE

ANGELO
ESCALUS
Look where he comes.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
Always obedient to your Grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life
That to th' observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise.
Hold, therefore, Angelo-
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
No more evasion!
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.
To th' hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple: your scope is as mine own,
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes;
Though it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO
2
DUKE
ESCALUS
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS
2
ANGELO
DUKE
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE
2
ANGELO
ESCALUS
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

ESCALUS
-1
I'll wait upon your honour.

If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition
with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the
King.

FIRST GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!

SECOND GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Amen.

LUCIO

FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to
sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap'd one out of the table.

SECOND GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO

FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Ay, that he raz'd.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain
and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal.
There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before
meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO
2
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was
said.

SECOND GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
No? A dozen times at least.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
What, in metre?

LUCIO
2
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
In any proportion or in any language.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO
2
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,
for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all
grace.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO
2
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
Thou art the list.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of
an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French
velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?

LUCIO
2
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of
thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin
thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
2
LUCIO
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

SECOND GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
free.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have
purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-

SECOND GENTLEMAN

FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
To what, I pray?

FIRST GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Judge.

SECOND GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
To three thousand dolours a year.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Ay, and more.

LUCIO
3
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
A French crown more.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO
3
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things
that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast
of thee.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
How now! which of your hips has the most profound
sciatica?

MRS OVERDONE
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Who's that, I pray thee?

MRS OVERDONE
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.

MRS OVERDONE
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him
carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his
head to be chopp'd off.

LUCIO
3
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art
thou sure of this?

MRS OVERDONE
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.

LUCIO
3
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours
since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

SECOND GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.

FIRST GENTLEMAN
3
LUCIO
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO
3
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Away; let's go learn the truth of it.

MRS OVERDONE

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.

POMPEY

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Yonder man is carried to prison.

MRS OVERDONE

POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Well, what has he done?

POMPEY
4
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
A woman.

MRS OVERDONE
4
POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
But what's his offence?

POMPEY
4
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MRS OVERDONE

POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
What! is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not

MRS OVERDONE

POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
What proclamation, man?

POMPEY

LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.

MRS OVERDONE
4
POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY
4
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that
a wise burgher put in for them.

MRS OVERDONE
4
POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pull'd down?

POMPEY
4
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
To the ground, mistress.

MRS OVERDONE
4
POMPEY
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?

POMPEY
4
LUCIO
FIRST GENTLEMAN
MRS OVERDONE
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.
Though you change your place you need not change your trade; I'll
be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you;
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will
be considered.

MRS OVERDONE

FIRST GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.

POMPEY

Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;
and there's Madam Juliet.

CLAUDIO

LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

PROVOST
3
LUCIO
CLAUDIO
JULIET
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for
certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief
have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment.
What's thy offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
No.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
Lechery?

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
Call it so.

PROVOST
3
LUCIO
CLAUDIO
JULIET
Away, sir; you must go.

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd
after?

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed.
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order; this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dow'r
Remaining in the coffer of her friends.
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,
With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the Duke-
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his eminence that fills it up,
I stagger in. But this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy
shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off.
Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter,
And there receive her approbation;
Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like,
which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the
enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus
foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
JULIET
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO
3
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
JULIET
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO
-1
Come, officer, away.

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS
1
DUKE
May your Grace speak of it?

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever lov'd the life removed,
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this.

FRIAR THOMAS
1
DUKE
Gladly, my lord.

DUKE
1
FRIAR THOMAS
We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS
1
DUKE
It rested in your Grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE
-1
I do fear, too dreadful.
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo impos'd the office;
Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you.
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
FRANCISCA
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
FRANCISCA
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO
2
ISABELLA
FRANCISCA
[ Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!

ISABELLA
2
LUCIO
FRANCISCA
Who's that which calls?

FRANCISCA
2
LUCIO
ISABELLA
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him:
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn;
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress;
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you answer him.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Why her 'unhappy brother'? Let me ask
The rather, for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella, and his sister.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Woe me! For what?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
It is true.
I would not- though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
Tongue far from heart- play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embrac'd.
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
She it is.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
O, let him marry her!

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
This is the point.
The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth, one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He- to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo. And that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Has censur'd him
Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Assay the pow'r you have.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
My power, alas, I doubt!

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
Our doubts are traitors,
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
But speedily.

ISABELLA
1
LUCIO
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
Commend me to my brother; soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO
1
ISABELLA
I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA

Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little

Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of our blood
Could have attain'd th' effect of your own purpose
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes. What knows the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ANGELO

FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
malefactors?

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
If it please your honour, I know not well what they are; but
precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all
profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS

ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO
5
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why
dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO
5
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
What are you, sir?

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad
woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, pluck'd down in the
suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a
very ill house too.

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
How know you that?

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
How! thy wife!

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that
this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life,
for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accus'd in fornication,
adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
By the woman's means?

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in
his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,
prove it.

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your
honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the
house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a
fruit dish, a dish of some three pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very good dishes.

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the
right; but to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as
I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I
said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I
said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you
know, Master Froth, I could not give you three pence again-

FROTH
5
ANGELO
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
No, indeed.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking
the stones of the foresaid prunes-

FROTH
5
ANGELO
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you
wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-

FROTH
5
ANGELO
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
All this is true.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Why, very well then-

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me
to what was done to her.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS
5
ANGELO
FROTH

POMPEY
ELBOW
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of
fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas- was't not
at Hallowmas, Master Froth?

FROTH

ANGELO

ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes,
where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?

FROTH
5
ANGELO
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
ELBOW
I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.

POMPEY
5
ANGELO
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO
5
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS

This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave,
And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.

Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW

FROTH

I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY

FROTH

I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS

FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY

Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY

FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS

I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose. Doth
your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS

FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY

FROTH
JUSTICE

Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.

FROTH

Well, I do so.

FROTH

Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Why, no.

POMPEY
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
about him. Good then; if his face be the worst thing about him,
how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would
know that of your honour.

ESCALUS
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?

ELBOW
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected
woman.

POMPEY
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
any of us all.

ELBOW
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or
child.

POMPEY

FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS

FROTH

ELBOW
Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
true?

ELBOW
4
FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
POMPEY
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
respected with her before I was married to her! If ever I was
respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me
the poor Duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.

ESCALUS

FROTH

If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW

FROTH

Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS

FROTH

Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his
courses till thou know'st what they are.

Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked

FROTH

So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPEY

FROTH
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS

FROTH

Your mistress' name?

Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS

POMPEY

Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
would not have you acquainted with tapsters: they will draw you,
Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me
hear no more of you.

FROTH

What else?

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey,
you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a
tapster. Are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better
for you.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
the city?

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
No, Pompey.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you
need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more
heads; if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest
house in it, after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come
to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS
3
JUSTICE
POMPEY
ELBOW
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon
any complaint whatsoever- no, not for dwelling where you do; if I
do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt.
So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY
3
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
ELBOW
I thank your worship for your good counsel; [Aside] but I
shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;
The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.

Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
ELBOW
I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say seven years together?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS
2
JUSTICE
ELBOW
Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward
sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW
2
JUSTICE
ESCALUS
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some
piece of money, and go through with all.

Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
most sufficient of your parish.

But there's no remedy.

JUSTICE

Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.

Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?

Lest I might be too rash;
Under your good correction, I have seen
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO

Go to; let that be mine.
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spar'd.

She's very near her hour.

Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,

O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO

ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
You are too cold: if you should need a pin,
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
To him, I say.

If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] You are too cold.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
May call it back again. Well, believe this:
No ceremony that to great ones longs,
Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you, and you as he,
You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Pray you be gone.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge
And what a prisoner.

LUCIO

ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

ANGELO

LUCIO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Alas! Alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Be you content, fair maid.
It is the law, not I condemn your brother.
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him. He must die to-morrow.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[Aside] Ay, well said.

ANGELO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
Those many had not dar'd to do that evil
If the first that did th' edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake,
Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-
Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born-
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But here they live to end.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO
3
LUCIO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] That's well said.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder,
Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,
Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,
Dress'd in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO
3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
He's coming; I perceive 't.

PROVOST
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
ISABELLA
[Aside] Pray heaven she win him.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them;
But in the less foul profanation.

3
ANGELO
PROVOST
ISABELLA
[To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.

ISABELLA
3
ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
That in the captain's but a choleric word
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault. If it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.

Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO

[To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.

ISABELLA

ANGELO
LUCIO
PROVOST
Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
Or stones, whose rate are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO

ISABELLA
Well; come to me to-morrow.

From thee; even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flow'r,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
When men were fond, I smil'd and wond'red how.

Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.

PROVOST

DUKE
I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE

PROVOST
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them, and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

PROVOST

DUKE
I would do more than that, if more were needful.

DUKE

PROVOST
JULIET
When must he die?

PROVOST

As I do think, to-morrow.
[To JULIET] I have provided for you; stay awhile
And you shall be conducted.

DUKE

PROVOST
JULIET
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET
2
DUKE
PROVOST
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE

PROVOST
JULIET
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET
2
DUKE
PROVOST
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE

PROVOST
JULIET
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET
2
DUKE
PROVOST
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE
2
PROVOST
JULIET
So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed.

JULIET
2
DUKE
PROVOST
Mutually.

DUKE

PROVOST
JULIET
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET
2
DUKE
PROVOST
I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE
2
PROVOST
JULIET
'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear-

JULIET
2
DUKE
PROVOST
I do repent me as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE

PROVOST
JULIET
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you! Benedicite!

JULIET

PROVOST
Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

PROVOST

'Tis pity of him.

When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name,
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
Is, like a good thing being often read,
Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
'Tis not the devil's crest.

SERVANT

ANGELO
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO

SERVANT
Teach her the way. [

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
That you might know it would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Even so! Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
As long as you or I; yet he must die.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Under your sentence?

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Yea.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather- that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Sir, believe this:
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
How say you?

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life;
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Nay, but hear me;
Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant
Or seem so, craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me:
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross-
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
So.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
True.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Admit no other way to save his life,
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desir'd of such a person
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-binding law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-
What would you do?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
As much for my poor brother as myself;
That is, were I under the terms of death,
Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield
My body up to shame.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
We are all frail.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Else let my brother die,
If not a fedary but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women, help heaven! Men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
I think it well;
And from this testimony of your own sex,
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now
By putting on the destin'd livery.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
Let me intreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for't.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
I know your virtue hath a license in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA
1
ANGELO
Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't.
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

ANGELO
1
ISABELLA
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, th' austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state,
Will so your accusation overweigh
That you shall stifle in your own report,
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can: my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA
0
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
Either of condemnation or approof,
Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation where thou keep'st
Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exists on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
And Death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,

Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
Therefore, your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.

But is there any?

ISABELLA

Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA

To a determin'd scope.

CLAUDIO

But in what nature?

ISABELLA

Let me know the point.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO

Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flow'ry tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA

DUKE
PROVOST
CLAUDIO
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

O heavens! it cannot be.

CLAUDIO

That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose
When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;
Or of the deadly seven it is the least.

Which is the least?

And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO
3
DUKE
PROVOST
ISABELLA
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.

Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO

What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;
Die; perish. Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

DUKE

PROVOST

Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath
made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true;
therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your
resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die;
go to your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO

The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness;
but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body
of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty
hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How
will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA

I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how
much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo! If ever he return, and
I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his
government.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only.
Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in
doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to
your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
business.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great
soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
name.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the
contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:
there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward
her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate
husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries
of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which
she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is
washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man
live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in
doing it.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
Show me how, good father.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
first affection; his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should
have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current,
made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to
the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that
your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all
shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course- and now follows all: we shall
advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your
place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and
the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for
his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the
doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What
think you of it?

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE
1
ISABELLA
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke's; there,
at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be
quickly.

ISABELLA
1
DUKE
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

ELBOW

Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs
buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the

POMPEY

ELBOW
DUKE
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest
was put down, and the worser allow'd by order of law a furr'd
gown to keep him warm; and furr'd with fox on lamb-skins too, to
signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the
facing.

ELBOW

DUKE
POMPEY
Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE
2
ELBOW
POMPEY
And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
you, sir?

ELBOW
2
DUKE
POMPEY
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a
strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.

DUKE
2
ELBOW
POMPEY
Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice; say to thyself
'From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.'
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY
2
ELBOW
DUKE
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
I would prove-

DUKE
2
ELBOW
POMPEY
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer;
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW
2
DUKE
POMPEY
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.
The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster; if he be a whoremonger,
and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE

ELBOW
POMPEY

From our faults, as his faults from seeming, free.

How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,
newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the
pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st
thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th'
last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was,
man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

Still thus, and thus; still worse!

How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,

Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is

Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd

POMPEY

ELBOW
DUKE
LUCIO
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO

ELBOW
DUKE

Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
thither. For debt, Pompey- or how?

ELBOW
3
DUKE
POMPEY
LUCIO
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of
antiquity, too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to
the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.

I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will
pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not
patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu trusty Pompey.

DUKE
POMPEY
Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
What news, friar, of the Duke?

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
in Rome; but where is he, think you?

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo
dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
He does well in't.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till
eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not
made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it
true, think you?

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes
water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he
is a motion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that
is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the
getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service,
and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
not inclin'd that way.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
O, sir, you are deceiv'd.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in
him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file
of the subject held the Duke to be wise.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
Wise? Why, no question but he was.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a
warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but
testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to
the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you
speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much
dark'ned in your malice.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE

ELBOW
POMPEY

Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
love.

LUCIO

ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me
desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
have spoke, you have courage to maintain it; I am bound to call
upon you; and I pray you your name?

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
I fear you not.

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me
too unhurtful an opposite. But, indeed, I can do you little harm:
you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
DUKE
POMPEY
I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no
more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
LUCIO
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO
3
ELBOW
POMPEY
DUKE
Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke
we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent will
unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in
his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would
have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to
light. Would he were return'd! Marry, this Claudio is condemned
for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee pray for me. The
Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not
past it yet; and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar
though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.
Farewell.

My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke's time;

What news abroad i' th' world?

DUKE
2
PROVOST

None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and,
as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough
to make fellowships accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the
wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every
day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

ESCALUS

DUKE

One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to
know himself.

DUKE

Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all
temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they
may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find
Claudio prepar'd. I am made to understand that you have lent him
visitation.

DUKE

PROVOST
ESCALUS
He professes to have received no sinister measure from his
judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good
leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.

ESCALUS

You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner

he is indeed Justice.

He hath a garden circummur'd with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
That makes his opening with this bigger key;
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

DUKE

But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA

I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't;
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me

Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA

No, none, but only a repair i' th' dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me; whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.

Ay, sir; a mystery.

POMPEY

Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your

prove my occupation a mystery; but what mystery there should be
in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I cannot imagine.

The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night
Envelop you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Not Isabel?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
No.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
They will then, ere't be long.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
There's some in hope.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just. [Knocking within] Now are they
This is a gentle provost; seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. [Knocking within]
How now, what noise! That spirit's possess'd with haste
That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in; he is call'd up.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
But he must die to-morrow?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
None, sir, none.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we.
Besides, upon the very siege of justice,
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.

DUKE
4
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
MESSENGER
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

MESSENGER
4
POMPEY
DUKE
PROVOST
ABHORSON
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further
charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it,
neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for
as I take it, it is almost day.

PROVOST
4
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
MESSENGER
I shall obey him.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
[Aside] This is his pardon, purchas'd by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in;
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is borne in high authority.
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended
That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine
office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks
strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Pray you, let's hear.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
[Reads] 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and, in the afternoon,
Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's
head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought
that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not
to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
What say you to this, sir?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th'
afternoon?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
A Bohemian born; but here nurs'd up and bred.
One that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him
to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his
manner to do so.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,
his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to
an undoubted proof.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
It is now apparent?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to
be touch'd?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past,
present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately
mortal.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
He wants advice.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many
times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft
awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a
seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost,
honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill
beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself
in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no
greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To
make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four
days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
a dangerous courtesy.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
In the delaying death.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an
express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view
of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the
smallest.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions
may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,
and his head borne to Angelo.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave
the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the
penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is
common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against
it with my life.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
To him and to his substitutes.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch
the justice of your dealing?

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you
fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can
with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck
all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of
the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is
not strange to you.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
I know them both.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall
anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within
these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows
not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,
perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some
monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th'
unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into
amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but
easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with
Barnardine's head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise
him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall
absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

POMPEY

I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of
profession; one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own
house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the
Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY
1
ABHORSON
Master Barnardine! You must rise and be hang'd, Master
Barnardine!

ABHORSON
1
POMPEY
What ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
there? What are you?

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir,
to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
[ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and
sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY
1
ABHORSON
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Very ready, sir.

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you?

ABHORSON
2
POMPEY
BARNARDINE
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers;
for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for't.

POMPEY
2
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
O, the better, sir! For he that drinks all night and is
hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next
day.

ABHORSON
3
POMPEY
DUKE
BARNARDINE
Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father.
Do we jest now, think you?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are
to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with
you.

BARNARDINE
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Friar, not I; I have been drinking hard all night, and
I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my
brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that's
certain.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
O, Sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
ABHORSON
BARNARDINE
But hear you-

BARNARDINE
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to
my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
A creature unprepar'd, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclin'd,
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo. See this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon;
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Let this be done:
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio.
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
I am your free dependant.

DUKE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo-
The Provost, he shall bear them- whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly. Him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount,
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanc'd form.
We shall proceed with Angelo.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
PROVOST
ABHORSON
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

PROVOST
3
POMPEY
DUKE
ABHORSON
I'll make all speed.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
[ Within ] Peace, ho, be here!

DUKE
2
POMPEY
ABHORSON
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither;
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Ho, by your leave!

DUKE
3
ISABELLA
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE
3
ISABELLA
POMPEY
ABHORSON
He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world.
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE
3
ISABELLA
POMPEY
ABHORSON
It is no other.
Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience,

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE
3
ISABELLA
POMPEY
ABHORSON
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!

DUKE
3
ISABELLA
POMPEY
ABHORSON
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity.
The Duke comes home to-morrow. Nay, dry your eyes.
One of our covent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
I am directed by you.

DUKE
3
POMPEY
ISABELLA
ABHORSON
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow,
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCIO

DUKE
ISABELLA
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Good even. Friar, where's the Provost?

DUKE
4
ISABELLA
LUCIO
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Not within, sir.

LUCIO
4
POMPEY
DUKE
ISABELLA
ABHORSON
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had
lived.

DUKE
3
LUCIO
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;
but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a
better woodman than thou tak'st him for.

DUKE
3
LUCIO
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty
tales of the Duke.

DUKE
3
LUCIO
POMPEY
ABHORSON
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be
true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE
3
LUCIO
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO
3
DUKE
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would
else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE
3
LUCIO
POMPEY
ABHORSON
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO
-1
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy
talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a
kind of burr; I shall stick.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
like to madness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted! And why
meet him at the gates, and redeliver our authorities there?

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I guess not.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
ent'ring that, if any crave redress of injustice, they should
exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
shall then have no power to stand against us.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaim'd;
Betimes i' th' morn I'll call you at your house;
Give notice to such men of sort and suit
As are to meet him.

ESCALUS
1
ANGELO
I shall, sir; fare you well.

ANGELO
1
ESCALUS
Good night.

ANGELO
0
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflow'red maid!
And by an eminent body that enforc'd
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears a so credent bulk
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have liv'd,
Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had liv'd!
Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.

DUKE
1
PETER
These letters at fit time deliver me.   [Giving letters]
The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
As cause doth minister. Go, call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.
PETER. It shall be speeded well.

DUKE
-1
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste.
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius!

ISABELLA
1
MARIANA
To speak so indirectly I am loath;
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part. Yet I am advis'd to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA
1
ISABELLA
Be rul'd by him.

ISABELLA
1
MARIANA
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA
1
ISABELLA
I would Friar Peter-

ISABELLA
2
PETER
MARIANA
O, peace! the friar is come.

PETER
-1
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The Duke is ent'ring; therefore, hence, away.

DUKE

Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

We have made inquiry of you, and we hear
Such goodness of your justice that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO

ESCALUS
You make my bonds still greater.

O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand,
And good supporters are you.

Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd- I would fain have said a maid!
O worthy Prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint,
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.

DUKE

O worthy Duke,

Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here!

ANGELO

My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother,
Cut off by course of justice-

By course of justice!

And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA

ANGELO

ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
Is it not strange and strange?

Nay, it is ten times strange.

Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To th' end of reck'ning.

O Prince! I conjure thee, as thou believ'st
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness. Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

DUKE

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
By mine honesty,
If she be mad, as I believe no other,
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA

ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
O gracious Duke,
Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE

ANGELO
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA

ANGELO
DUKE
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger-

LUCIO

ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
That's I, an't like your Grace.
I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA

LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST

That's he, indeed.

You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO

No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE

ANGELO
ISABELLA

I wish you now, then;
Pray you take note of it; and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO

I warrant your honour.

The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA

This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.

LUCIO

PROVOST
PETER
Right.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO

It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA

ANGELO

LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA

PETER
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE

Mended again. The matter- proceed.

ISABELLA

ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
In brief- to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,
For this was of much length- the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
This is most likely!

ISABELLA

O that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou cam'st here to complain.

ISABELLA
6
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience; and, with ripened time,
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA
6
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA

ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO
6
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar.
I do not like the man; had he been lay, my lord,
For certain words he spake against your Grace
In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Words against me? This's a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO
6
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

PETER
6
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
Blessed be your royal Grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

PETER
6
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.

LUCIO
6
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
My lord, most villainously; believe it.

PETER
6
ANGELO
DUKE
ISABELLA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request-
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he, with his oath
And all probation, will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman-
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accus'd-
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE
6
ANGELO

Good friar, let's hear it.

Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife.

LUCIO

My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither
maid, widow, nor wife.

Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.

Well, my lord.

MARIANA

And I confess, besides, I am no maid.
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.

This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA
6
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Now I come to't, my lord:
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,
With all th' effect of love.

ANGELO

DUKE
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST

Charges she moe than me?

MARIANA

Not that I know.

No? You say your husband.

MARIANA
6
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO

Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO
6
DUKE
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA
6
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagin'd person.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST

Know you this woman?

Enough, my lord.

ANGELO
6
DUKE
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition; but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity. Since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA
6
ANGELO
DUKE
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Noble Prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house,
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO
6
DUKE
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
I did but smile till now.
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,
To find this practice out.

DUKE
6
ANGELO
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Ay, with my heart;
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit,
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

PETER
6
ANGELO
DUKE
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
Would lie were here, my lord! For he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint.
Your provost knows the place where he abides,
And he may fetch him.

We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable
fellow.

Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox,
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain; and then to glance from him
To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What, 'unjust'!

DUKE

ISABELLA
MARIANA
LUCIO
ESCALUS
PROVOST
PETER
Be not so hot; the Duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own; his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

PROVOST
PETER
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well-defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother-
Being criminal in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach,
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life,
And choke your good to come. For his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal
To buy you a better husband.

O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;

Against all sense you do importune her.
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say best men moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad; so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

[Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
Till he did look on me; since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died;
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.

Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Pardon me, noble lord;
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserv'd alive.

I am sorry one so learned and so wise

Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd;
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffl'd fellow's that?

[To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman!
Wherein have I so deserv'd of you
That you extol me thus?

Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.
Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,
If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow-
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.
