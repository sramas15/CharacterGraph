AEGEON

GAOLER
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
And by the doom of death end woes and all.

DUKE
2
GAOLER
AEGEON
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
I am not partial to infringe our laws.
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus
Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again, if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,
His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.

AEGEON
2
DUKE
GAOLER
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

DUKE
2
GAOLER
AEGEON
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou departed'st from thy native home,
And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.

AEGEON
2
DUKE
GAOLER
A heavier task could not have been impos'd
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
In Syracuse was I born, and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
And the great care of goods at random left,
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old,
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me,
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
As could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
A mean woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return;
Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
Before the always-wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope,
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
And, by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us-
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

DUKE
2
GAOLER
AEGEON
Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

AEGEON
2
DUKE
GAOLER
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encount'red by a mighty rock,
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length another ship had seiz'd on us;
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

DUKE
2
GAOLER
AEGEON
And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favour to dilate at full
What have befall'n of them and thee till now.

AEGEON
2
DUKE
GAOLER
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother, and importun'd me
That his attendant-so his case was like,
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-
Might bear him company in the quest of him;
Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbours men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death,
Could all my travels warrant me they live.

DUKE
2
GAOLER
AEGEON
Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
But though thou art adjudged to the death,
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
But to our honour's great disparagement,
Yet will I favour thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
To seek thy help by beneficial hap.
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

GAOLER
2
DUKE
AEGEON
I will, my lord.

AEGEON
2
DUKE
GAOLER
Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

FIRST MERCHANT

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And, not being able to buy out his life,
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
2
FIRST MERCHANT
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time;
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn;
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
2
FIRST MERCHANT
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
FIRST MERCHANT
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

FIRST MERCHANT
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
And afterward consort you till bed time.
My present business calls me from you now.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
FIRST MERCHANT
Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
And wander up and down to view the city.

FIRST MERCHANT
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sir, I commend you to your own content.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
0
He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late.
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell-
My mistress made it one upon my cheek;
She is so hot because the meat is cold,
The meat is cold because you come not home,
You come not home because you have no stomach,
You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
Are penitent for your default to-day.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I am not in a sportive humour now;
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
My mistress and her sister stays for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands!
Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'erraught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage;
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin;
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.
A man is master of his liberty;
Time is their master, and when they see time,
They'll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
Why should their liberty than ours be more?

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Because their business still lies out o' door.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
O, know he is the bridle of your will.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
There's none but asses will be bridled so.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.
Man, more divine, the master of all these,
Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas,
Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords;
Then let your will attend on their accords.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
How if your husband start some other where?

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Till he come home again, I would forbear.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,
As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
But if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.

ADRIANA

LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two
ears can witness.

ADRIANA
2
LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA
2
ADRIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
Nay, he struck so plainly I could to
well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could
scarce understand them.

ADRIANA
2
LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA
2
LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
"Tis dinner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'

LUCIANA
2
ADRIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Quoth who?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
Quoth my master.
'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA
2
LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA
2
LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
ADRIANA
LUCIANA
And he will bless that cross with other beating;
Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA
2
LUCIANA
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
2
LUCIANA
ADRIANA
Am I so round with you, as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.
Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault; he's master of my state.
What ruins are in me that can be found
By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;
Would that alone a love he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
That others touch and, often touching, will
Where gold; and no man that hath a name
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
By computation and mine host's report
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest.
Upon what bargain do you give it me?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sconce, call you it? So you would
leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use
these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and
insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say
every why hath a wherefore.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Thank me, sir! for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave
me for nothing.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I'll make you amends next, to
give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
In good time, sir, what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
another dry basting.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
there's a time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I durst have denied that, before you
were so choleric.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the
plain bald pate of Father Time himself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
There's no time for a man to recover
his hair that grows bald by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and
recover the lost hair of another man.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why is Time such a niggard of
hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Because it is a blessing that he bestows
on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
given them in wit.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, but there's many a man
hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Not a man of those but he hath the
wit to lose his hair.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, thou didst conclude hairy
men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;
yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
For two; and sound ones too.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Nay, not sound I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sure ones, then.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Certain ones, then.

The one, to save the money that he spends in
tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his

You would all this time have prov'd there

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
hair lost by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
But your reason was not substantial, why
there is no time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.

I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
soft, who wafts us yonder?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art then estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled thence that drop again
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself, and not me too.
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
And hurl the name of husband in my face,
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
For if we two be one, and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.

ADRIANA
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
As strange unto your town as to your talk,
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Wants wit in all one word to understand.

Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate.
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

LUCIANA
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
ADRIANA
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Herein you war against your reputation,
And draw within the compass of suspect
Th' unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
And, about evening, come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever hous'd where it gets possession.

Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife-but, I protest, without desert-
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;
To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
For there's the house. That chain will I bestow-
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-
Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;
Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board;
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? Would you create me new?
Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;
Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die.
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.

LUCIANA
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
That's my sister.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
LUCIANA
No;
It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.

LUCIANA
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
All this my sister is, or else should be.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
LUCIANA
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.

LUCIANA
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
O, soft, sir, hold you still;
I'll fetch my sister to get her good will.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
so fast?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?
Am I your man? Am I myself?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Thou art Dromio, thou art my
man, thou art thyself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and besides
myself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
What woman's man, and how besides thyself?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due
to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one
that will have me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
What claim lays she to thee?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, such claim as you would
lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not
that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
What is she?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
A very reverent body; ay, such a one
as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'
I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench,
and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but
to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn
week longer than the whole world.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
What complexion is she of?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Swart, like my shoe; but her face
nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may
go over shoes in the grime of it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
That's a fault that water will mend.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood
could not do it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
What's her name?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Nell, sir; but her name and three
quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure
her from hip to hip.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then she bears some breadth?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No longer from head to foot than
from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find
out countries in her.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
In what part of her body stands Ireland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by
the bogs.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Where Scotland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I found it by the barrenness, hard in
the palm of the hand.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Where France?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
making war against her heir.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Where England?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her
chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Where Spain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
her breath.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Where America, the Indies?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the
hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
ballast at her nose.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
O, Sir, I did not look so low. To
conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call'd me
Dromio; swore I was assur'd to her; told me what privy
marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the
mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,
amaz'd, ran from her as a witch.
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Go hie thee presently post to the road;
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
I will not harbour in this town to-night.
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If every one knows us, and we know none,
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
As from a bear a man would run for life,
So fly I from her that would be my wife.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
0
There's none but witches do inhabit here,
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
Hath almost made me traitor to myself;
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

ANGELO

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

ANGELO
Ay, that's my name.

ANGELO
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
1
ANGELO
What is your will that I shall do with this?

ANGELO
1
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

ANGELO

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
And then receive my money for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

ANGELO
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

What I should think of this cannot tell:
But this I think, there's no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
If any ship put out, then straight away.

You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
And since I have not much importun'd you;

To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
Therefore make present satisfaction,
Or I'll attach you by this officer.

I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.

Saving your merry humour, here's the note
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more

I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.

Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

On, officer, to prison till it come.

To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.

For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

ADRIANA

LUCIANA
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation mad'st thou in this case
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

LUCIANA
1
ADRIANA
First he denied you had in him no right.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
He meant he did me none-the more my spite.

LUCIANA

Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

ADRIANA

And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

Then pleaded I for you.

That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

Didst speak him fair?

LUCIANA

ADRIANA
Have patience, I beseech.

ADRIANA
1
LUCIANA
I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
Ill-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

LUCIANA

Who would be jealous then of such a one?
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

ADRIANA

Ah, but I think him better than I say,
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;

Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.

As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me, some invite me,
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,

Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,

And therewithal took measure of my body.

And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest

them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.

Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.

Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
Else would he never so demean himself.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
Both one and other he denies me now.
The reason that I gather he is mad,
Besides this present instance of his rage,
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.

beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am
wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as
beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me,
I shall beg with it from door to door.

May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
Who I made lord of me and all I had
At your important letters-this ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
That desp'rately he hurried through the street,
With him his bondman all as mad as he,
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
That here and there his fury had committed.
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
He broke from those that had the guard of him,
And with his mad attendant and himself,
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again and, madly bent on us,
Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,

Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;
And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
My master preaches patience to him, and the while

And sure, unless you send some present help,
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

My liege, I am advised what I say;
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him. In the street I met him,
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats; he with none return'd.
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.

And so do I, yet did she call me so;
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother.  [To LUCIANA]  What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.

This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,

I see we still did meet each other's man,
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.

Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here,
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
And all that are assembled in this place
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
After so long grief, such nativity!

There is a fat friend at your master's house,
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner;
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother;
I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

Not I, sir; you are my elder.

We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then,

Nay, then, thus:
We came into the world like brother and brother,
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
