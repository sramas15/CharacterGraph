DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors- for so you are
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires-
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Berowne, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here.
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein.
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

LONGAVILLE

DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine.
Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

DUMAIN
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,
With all these living in philosophy.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances,
As: not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food,
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then to sleep but three hours in the night
And not be seen to wink of all the day-
When I was wont to think no harm all night,
And make a dark night too of half the day-
Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your Grace,
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study, let me know.

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Why, that to know which else we should not know.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know,
As thus: to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,
Study to break it, and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus, and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
These be the stops that hinder study quite,
And train our intellects to vain delight.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,
As painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed,
By fixing it upon a fairer eye;
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;
Small have continual plodders ever won,
Save base authority from others' books.
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.

KING

DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
How well he's read, to reason against reading!

DUMAIN
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
How follows that?

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN
3
KING
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
In reason nothing.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Something then in rhyme.

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows;
But like of each thing that in season grows;
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore,
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name.

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
[Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of
my court'- Hath this been proclaimed?

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
Four days ago.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her
tongue.' Who devis'd this penalty?

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
Marry, that did I.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Sweet lord, and why?

LONGAVILLE
3
DUMAIN
KING
BEROWNE
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
A dangerous law against gentility.
[Reads] 'Item. If any man be seen to talk with a woman within
the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the
rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter, with yourself to speak-
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father;
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes th' admired princess hither.

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
So study evermore is over-shot.
While it doth study to have what it would,
It doth forget to do the thing it should;
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might mast'red, but by special grace.
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:
I am forsworn on mere necessity.
So to the laws at large I write my name;        [Subscribes]
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?

KING
3
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain,
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One who the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate,
In high-born words, the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But I protest I love to hear him lie,
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

BEROWNE
3
DUMAIN
KING
LONGAVILLE
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

LONGAVILLE
3
KING
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study three years is but short.

How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

LONGAVILLE

A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!

To hear, or forbear hearing?

LONGAVILLE
5

To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to
forbear both.

BEROWNE

Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
in the merriness.

COSTARD

KING
BEROWNE

LONGAVILLE
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BEROWNE
5
KING
DUMAIN
COSTARD
DULL
LONGAVILLE
In what manner?

COSTARD
5
KING
BEROWNE
DUMAIN
DULL
LONGAVILLE
In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was
seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form,
and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is in
manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner- it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form- in some form.

BEROWNE
5
KING
DUMAIN
COSTARD
DULL
LONGAVILLE
For the following, sir?

COSTARD
5
KING
BEROWNE
DUMAIN
DULL
LONGAVILLE
As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the
right!

DUMAIN

Will you hear this letter with attention?

BEROWNE

DULL

As we would hear an oracle.

which is called supper. So much for the time When. Now for the
ground Which? which, I mean, I upon; it is ycleped thy park. Then
for the place Where? where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene
and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow-white pen
the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest, beholdest,
surveyest, or seest. But to the place Where? It standeth
north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy

Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to

Sir, I confess the wench.

Did you hear the proclamation?

COSTARD

I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
marking of it.

KING

BEROWNE
DUMAIN

LONGAVILLE
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a
wench.

COSTARD

I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.

BEROWNE
DUMAIN
COSTARD
DULL
LONGAVILLE
Well, it was proclaimed damsel.

COSTARD
5
KING
BEROWNE
DUMAIN
DULL
LONGAVILLE
This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.

KING

BEROWNE
DUMAIN
COSTARD
DULL
LONGAVILLE
It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.

COSTARD
5
KING
BEROWNE
DUMAIN

If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.

These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.

I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken

welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile
again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
melancholy?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, no; O Lord, sir, no!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender
juvenal?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Why tough signior? Why tough signior?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old
time, which we may name tough.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Pretty and apt.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and
my saying pretty?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Thou pretty, because little.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
And therefore apt, because quick.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Speak you this in my praise, master?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
In thy condign praise.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I will praise an eel with the same praise.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
that an eel is ingenious?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
That an eel is quick.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I am answer'd, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I love not to be cross'd.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I have promised to study three years with the Duke.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You may do it in an hour, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Impossible.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
How many is one thrice told?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete
man.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
amounts to.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
It doth amount to one more than two.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Which the base vulgar do call three.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
True.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three
studied ere ye'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years'
to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the
dancing horse will tell you.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
A most fine figure!

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] To prove you a cipher.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing
my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy. I
think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort
me, boy; what great men have been in love?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Hercules, master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;
and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a
porter; and he was in love.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in
love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A woman, master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Of what complexion?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the
four.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Tell me precisely of what complexion.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Of the sea-water green, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Is that one of the four complexions?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He
surely affected her for her wit.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
My love is most immaculate white and red.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such
colours.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Define, define, well-educated infant.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!

MOTH
1
ARMADO
     If she be made of white and red,
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or if it were, it
would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love
that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind
Costard; she deserves well.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.

ARMADO

I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread.
I shall be forsworn- which is a great argument of falsehood- if I
love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted?
Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but
Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent
strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club, and therefore
too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second cause
will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello
he regards not; his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory
is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum;
for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me, some
extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.
Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits.
Consider who the King your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear,
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.

Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.
Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
Not utt'red by base sale of chapmen's tongues;
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court.
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his Grace.
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visag'd suitors, his high will.

I know him, madam; at a marriage feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms;
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will,
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.

The young Dumain, a well-accomplish'd youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved;
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.

Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Berowne they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal.
His eye begets occasion for his wit,
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales,
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.

Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the King your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal,
And have the money by our father lent,
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
And go well satisfied to France again.

Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.
His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed;
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair.
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd.
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

ARMADO

Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give
enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must
employ him in a letter to my love.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How meanest thou? Brawling in French?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your
eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the
throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime
through the nose, as if you snuff'd up love by smelling love,
with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes, with
your arms cross'd on your thin-belly doublet, like a rabbit on a
spit, or your hands in your pocket, like a man after the old
painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these betray nice
wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men
of note- do you note me?- that most are affected to these.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How hast thou purchased this experience?

MOTH

ARMADO

MOTH

ARMADO

Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

MOTH

ARMADO
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love
perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Almost I had.

MOTH

ARMADO
Negligent student! learn her by heart.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
By heart and in heart, boy.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
What wilt thou prove?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
instant. By heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by
her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with
her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I am all these three.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an
ass.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Ha, ha, what sayest thou?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
very slow-gaited. But I go.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The way is but short; away.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
As swift as lead, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I say lead is slow.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun?

ARMADO

MOTH
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he;
I shoot thee at the swain.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Thump, then, and I flee.

A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face;
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.

No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain; no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no
salve, sir, but a plantain!

ARMADO

MOTH
COSTARD
By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous
smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take
salve for l'envoy, and the word 'l'envoy' for a salve?

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

MOTH

COSTARD
ARMADO
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.

ARMADO

COSTARD
 The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,

MOTH

   Until the goose came out of door,
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my l'envoy.

ARMADO

MOTH
COSTARD
 Until the goose came out of door,

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose;
Let me see: a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?

MOTH
2
COSTARD
ARMADO
I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

ARMADO

MOTH
COSTARD
We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD

MOTH
ARMADO
Till there be more matter in the shin.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
goose, in this.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured, restrained,
captivated, bound.

COSTARD
2
MOTH
ARMADO
True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
loose.

ARMADO
2
MOTH
COSTARD
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: bear this
significant [giving a letter] to the country maid Jaquenetta;
there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honour is
rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

MOTH

COSTARD
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.

COSTARD

MOTH
My sweet ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the
Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.
'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give
you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of
this word.

Hark, slave, it is but this:
The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

COSTARD

Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration; a
'leven-pence farthing better; most sweet gardon! I will do it,
sir, in print. Gardon- remuneration!

BEROWNE

And I, forsooth, in love; I, that have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
Th' anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator, and great general
Of trotting paritors. O my little heart!
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What! I love, I sue, I seek a wife-
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjur'd, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed,
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan:
Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.

And, out of question, so it is sometimes:

[Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible;
true that thou art beauteous; truth itself that thou art lovely.
More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth
itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal. The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the
pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon; and he it was that
might rightly say, 'Veni, vidi, vici'; which to annothanize in
the vulgar,- O base and obscure vulgar!- videlicet, He came, saw,
and overcame. He came, one; saw, two; overcame, three. Who came?-
the king. Why did he come?- to see. Why did he see?-to overcome.
To whom came he?- to the beggar. What saw he?- the beggar. Who
overcame he?- the beggar. The conclusion is victory; on whose
side?- the king's. The captive is enrich'd; on whose side?- the
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial; on whose side?- the
king's. No, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so
stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy
lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy
love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou
exchange for rags?- robes, for tittles?- titles, for thyself?
-me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my
eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part.
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey;
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play.
But if thou strive, poor soul, what are thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.'

Armado a th' t'one side- O, a most dainty man!
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!

smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of
invention? Imitari is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the

desired employment, Berowne.' Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one
of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a letter
to a sequent of the stranger queen's which accidentally, or by

The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself.
They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not

[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his, your case is such.
You chide at him, offending twice as much:
You do not love Maria! Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile;
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom, to keep down his heart.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.
I heard your guilty rhymes, observ'd your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.
'Ay me!' says one. 'O Jove!' the other cries.
One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other's eyes.
[To LONGAVILLE] You would for paradise break faith and troth;
[To Dumain] And Jove for your love would infringe an oath.
What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
Faith infringed which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.

Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me.
Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjur'd; 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting.
But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the King your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of fool'ry have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!
O, me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? All about the breast.
A caudle, ho!

I that am honest, I that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;

With men like you, men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for Joan? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb-

Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues-
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not!
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs:
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye.
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy.
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine!

A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? Where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look.
No face is fair that is not full so black.

Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deckt,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days;
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red that would avoid dispraise
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men-at-arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto:
To fast, to study, and to see no woman-
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream, and pore, and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They are the ground, the books, the academes,
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,
And where we are our learning likewise is;
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
With ourselves.
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain,
But with the motion of all elements
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye:
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd.
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails:
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair.
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain, and nourish, all the world,
Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear;
Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love;
Or for Love's sake, a word that loves all men;
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men-
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn;
For charity itself fulfils the law,
And who can sever love from charity?

First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress. In the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks, and merry hours,
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have
been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty
without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without
opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam
day with a companion of the King's who is intituled, nominated,
or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

HOLOFERNES

Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his
gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and
thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd,
as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

NATHANIEL

A most singular and choice epithet.

HOLOFERNES

He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than
the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes,
such insociable and point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak 'dout' fine, when he should say 'doubt';
'det' when he should pronounce 'debt'- d, e, b, t, not d, e, t.
He clepeth a calf 'cauf,' half 'hauf'; neighbour vocatur
'nebour'; 'neigh' abbreviated 'ne.' This is abhominable- which he
would call 'abbominable.' It insinuateth me of insanie: ne
intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.

serious designs, and of great import indeed, too- but let that
pass; for I must tell thee it will please his Grace, by the
world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal
finger thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio; but,
sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable:
some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart
to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world;
but let that pass. The very all of all is- but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy- that the King would have me present the
Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show,

And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,
And shape his service wholly to my hests,

KATHARINE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo, to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The King and his companions; warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear-
That, by and by, disguis'd they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage.
Action and accent did they teach him there:
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out;
'For' quoth the King 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that all laugh'd, and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
One rubb'd his elbow, thus, and fleer'd, and swore
A better speech was never spoke before.
Another with his finger and his thumb
Cried 'Via! we will do't, come what will come.'
The third he caper'd, and cried 'All goes well.'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.

But what, but what, come they to visit us?

BOYET

KATHARINE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parley, court, and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress; which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
BOYET
ROSALINE
MARIA
And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the King will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.
And change you favours too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceiv'd by these removes.

ROSALINE

KATHARINE
BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
MARIA
Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.

KATHARINE

BOYET
ROSALINE

But, in this changing, what is your intent?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
BOYET
ROSALINE
MARIA
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
They do it but in mocking merriment,
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet
With visages display'd to talk and greet.

ROSALINE

KATHARINE
BOYET

But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
BOYET
ROSALINE

No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

BOYET

KATHARINE
ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
BOYET
ROSALINE
MARIA
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out.
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own;
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they well mock'd depart away with shame.

And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.
'A can carve too, and lisp; why this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms; nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.
This is the flow'r that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whales-bone;
And consciences that will not die in debt
Pay him the due of 'honey-tongued Boyet.'

Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song.
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical- these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!-
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas, and honest kersey noes.
And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.

I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd,
Told our intents before; which once disclos'd,
The ladies did change favours; and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn in will and error.
Much upon this it is; [To BOYET] and might not you
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out. Go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? There's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.

For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath- your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed;
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate.
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the King.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths; your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents;
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain;
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance;
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if in your heavenly eyes
Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both- fair ladies, you;
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time;
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.

A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjur'd much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this,
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught- this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood,
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial, and last love,
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come, challenge me, challenge me by these deserts;
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut
My woeful self up in a mournful house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither intitled in the other's heart.

Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick, and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it; then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal.
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.
