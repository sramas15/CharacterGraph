Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit,
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease;
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.

It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?'

And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,

Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.

To see my friends in Padua; but of all

Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?

And then I know after who comes by the worst.

for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I
see, two and thirty, a pip out?
Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
GRUMIO
Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

HORTENSIO
2
GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
GRUMIO
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO
2
HORTENSIO
PETRUCHIO
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.
Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though
she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing
comes amiss, so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO
2
GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is- that she is intolerable curst,
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
GRUMIO
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.
Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
For I will board her though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

Her name is Katherina Minola,

I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO
2
HORTENSIO
PETRUCHIO
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my
word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding
would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once, he'll
rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she stand
him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so
disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.

He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;
And her withholds from me, and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
Supposing it a thing impossible-
For those defects I have before rehears'd-
That ever Katherina will be woo'd.
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO

HORTENSIO
PETRUCHIO
Katherine the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO

GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may by this device at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
And unsuspected court her by herself.

O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her.
You understand me- over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me have them very well perfum'd;
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

LUCENTIO

HORTENSIO
GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO
GREMIO
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,

Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promis'd to enquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man; for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.

HORTENSIO

LUCENTIO
GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO

'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman

To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.

Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

LUCENTIO
HORTENSIO
GRUMIO
GREMIO
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a fariner's fire?
Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.

Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
Do me this right- hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown,
And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have, and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed.
The younger then is free, and not before.

If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access- whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO

GRUMIO

To whom we all rest generally beholding.

Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,

Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-

Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-
Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!
For, knowing thee to be but young and light-

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Should be! should- buzz!

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
My remedy is then to pluck it out.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
In his tail.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Whose tongue?

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
That I'll try.                    [She strikes him]

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
So may you lose your arms.
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
What is your crest- a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
There is, there is.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Then show it me.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Had I a glass I would.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
What, you mean my face?

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Well aim'd of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Yet you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
'Tis with cares.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
I care not.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
It is extempore, from my mother wit.

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
A witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Am I not wise?

KATHERINA
1
PETRUCHIO
Yes, keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO
1
KATHERINA
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.

Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?

KATHERINA

GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO

KATHERINA
GREMIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHERINA

I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!

PETRUCHIO

KATHERINA
GREMIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.
How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.

BAPTISTA

God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.

Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
We will have rings and things, and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.

No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for;
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.

But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.

But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA

KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO

Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?

GREMIO

KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO
4
KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
BAPTISTA
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son;
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good
Within rich Pisa's walls as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO

KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
[Aside]  My land amounts not to so much in all.-
That she shall have, besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles road.
What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?

TRANIO

KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
BAPTISTA
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.

GREMIO
4
KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have;
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

TRANIO
4
KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
BAPTISTA
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA
4
KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
I must confess your offer is the best;
And let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;
If you should die before him, where's her dower?

TRANIO

KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
BAPTISTA
That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.

GREMIO

And may not young men die as well as old?

BAPTISTA

KATHERINA
GREMIO
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katherine is to be married;
Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
If not, to Signior Gremio.
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO

KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO

Adieu, good neighbour.
Now, I fear thee not.
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

TRANIO

KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;
And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

HORTENSIO
TRANIO
KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!

After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause serve in your harmony.

To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I arn no breeching scholar in the schools,

Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!

'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am Lucentio-
'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus' disguised
thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that

 [To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said? What mockery will it be
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?

KATHERINA

BIANCA
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
GREMIO
LUCENTIO
No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'

TRANIO

Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.

Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old
jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots
that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an old
rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt,
and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with an
old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess'd
with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with

half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,
being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often
burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times piec'd,

He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been abroad, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck,
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo.
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before.
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.         [Music plays]

GRUMIO

Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse;
thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me
because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to
pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never pray'd
before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was
burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienc'd to
thy grave.

CURTIS

Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the
rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats brush'd

Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,

Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.
And for this night we'll fast for company.

In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
And sits as one new risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come, and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her-
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.

O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO

BIANCA
LUCENTIO
TRANIO
Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
Nor a musician as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise
For such a one as leaves a gentleman
And makes a god of such a cullion.
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

TRANIO

BIANCA
HORTENSIO
LUCENTIO
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO

BIANCA
LUCENTIO
TRANIO
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

TRANIO
3
BIANCA
HORTENSIO
LUCENTIO
And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!

HORTENSIO

BIANCA
LUCENTIO
TRANIO
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealtlly widow
Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO

BIANCA
LUCENTIO
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

BIANCA

LUCENTIO
TRANIO
Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?

TRANIO

Mistress, we have.

Then we are rid of Licio.

The taming-school! What, is there such a place?

TRANIO

Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

TRANIO

PEDANT

'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

PEDANT

Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you-
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

PEDANT

TRANIO
BIANCA
LUCENTIO
BIONDELLO
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

LUCENTIO
BIONDELLO
Among them know you one Vincentio?

PEDANT

I know him not, but I have heard of him,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO
4
PEDANT
BIANCA
LUCENTIO
BIONDELLO
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO

TRANIO
PEDANT
BIANCA
LUCENTIO
 [Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all
one.

TRANIO
4
PEDANT
BIANCA
LUCENTIO
BIONDELLO
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
Look that you take upon you as you should.
You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city.
If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.

PEDANT

TRANIO
BIANCA
LUCENTIO
BIONDELLO
O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO

PEDANT
BIANCA
LUCENTIO
BIONDELLO
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand:
My father is here look'd for every day
To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

GRUMIO

KATHERINA
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

KATHERINA
1
GRUMIO
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars that come unto my father's door
Upon entreaty have a present alms;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
And that which spites me more than all these wants-
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

GRUMIO

KATHERINA
What say you to a neat's foot?

KATHERINA

GRUMIO
'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.

I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHERINA
1
GRUMIO
I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO
1
KATHERINA
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHERINA
1
GRUMIO
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO
1
KATHERINA
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

KATHERINA
1
GRUMIO
Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO
1
KATHERINA
Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHERINA
1
GRUMIO
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.

GRUMIO
1
KATHERINA
Why then the mustard without the beef.

KATHERINA
1
GRUMIO
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.

Will we return unto thy father's house
And revel it as bravely as the best,
With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.
With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.

Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments;
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What, is the jay more precious than the lark
Because his feathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.
If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.

Signior Baptista may remember me
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO

'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as longeth to a father.

Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.

Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO

LUCENTIO
TRANIO
BAPTISTA
BIONDELLO
Soft, son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself;
And- for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him- to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

BAPTISTA
4
PEDANT
LUCENTIO
TRANIO
BIONDELLO
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done-
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANIO
4
PEDANT
LUCENTIO
BAPTISTA
BIONDELLO
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied, and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?

BAPTISTA

PEDANT
LUCENTIO
TRANIO
BIONDELLO
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO

PEDANT
LUCENTIO
BAPTISTA
BIONDELLO
Then at my lodging, an it like you.
There doth my father lie; and there this night
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA

PEDANT
LUCENTIO
TRANIO
BIONDELLO
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

LUCENTIO

BIONDELLO
Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound
the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
I pray thee moralize them.

BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
father of a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
And what of him?

BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
And then?

BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command
at all hours.

LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
And what of all this?

BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio
ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk, and
some sufficient honest witnesses.
If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.

LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
Hear'st thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon
as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so
may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to
go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you
come with your appendix.

LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
I may and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.

And so it shall be so for Katherine.

Happily met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO

For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will ad
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is chang'd, as she had never been.

Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.

Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am asham'd that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toll and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot;
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
