OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,

3
ORLANDO
DUKE SENIOR
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are

ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,

ROSALIND

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
    assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes

  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
SALIND. Do you think so?
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
LIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
  ROSALIND.

LVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
  PHEBE.

SILVIUS
EBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. I would have you.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Why, that were covetousness.
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
  PHEBE.

SILVIUS
EBE. I'll write it straight;

ROSALIND
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
    swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO

  CELIA.

ROSALIND
LIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
  CELIA.

    comes here.
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LIA. Alas, poor shepherd!

2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
  OLIVER.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. By and by.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I would I were at home.
  CELIA.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. We'll lead you thither.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND

OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

DUKE SENIOR

QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
  JAQUES. 
3
ORLANDO
DUKE SENIOR
JAQUES
QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
  ORLANDO.

ORLANDO
DUKE SENIOR
JAQUES

ORLANDO
DUKE SENIOR

  JAQUES. 
3
ORLANDO
DUKE SENIOR
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
  JAQUES. 
3
ORLANDO
DUKE SENIOR
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
    Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
    That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.

    And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
    That every eye which in this forest looks
    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,
    The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit

CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in

2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. No, truly.
  TOUCHSTONE.

CORIN

  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. Nay, I hope.

2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO

  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you

2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our

2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
  CORIN. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
  CELIA. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
  CELIA. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. Is it possible?

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
  CELIA. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Yes, just.
  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Just as high as my heart.
  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
  JAQUES.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

  JAQUES. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Very well; what would you?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Who stays it still withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
  ORLANDO.

TOUCHSTONE
DREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and

1
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
  AUDREY. 
1
TOUCHSTONE
DREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
1
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
    assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes
    Sir Oliver.

ROSALIND
SALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
SALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
SALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Do you think so?
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Not true in love?
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.

ROSALIND
LIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave

    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
    spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble

LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
    Say that you love me not; but say not so
    In bitterness. The common executioner,
    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,

ROSALIND
SILVIUS

1
SILVIUS
SALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,

    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
    Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,

  JAQUES.

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear

    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to

2
ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO

2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO

  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I hope so.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,

ROSALIND

LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never

ROSALIND

2
ROSALIND

    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,

OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

CORIN
ROSALIND
LVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
    If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
    That ever love did make thee run into,
    Thou hast not lov'd;
    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
    Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
    Thou hast not lov'd;
    Or if thou hast not broke from company
    Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
    Thou hast not lov'd.
    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius

2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?

2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
  JAQUES. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,

    That every eye which in this forest looks

CORIN

CORIN

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.

ROSALIND

ORLANDO
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

ROSALIND
OLIVER

OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,

2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
    But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
  PHEBE. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
EBE. I would not be thy executioner;
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. O dear Phebe,
  PHEBE. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
EBE. But till that time
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
  PHEBE. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
EBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
  PHEBE. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
EBE. For no ill will I bear you.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
  ROSALIND. 
1
SILVIUS
SALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
    For I am falser than vows made in wine;
    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
    Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
    And be not proud; though all the world could see,
    None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
    Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. I would have you.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Why, that were covetousness.
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
  SILVIUS. 
1
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
  PHEBE. 
1
SILVIUS
EBE. I'll write it straight;
  PHEBE.

ROSALIND
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
    swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO

  CELIA.

ROSALIND

  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
  CELIA.

    comes here.
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

  CELIA.

ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LIA. Alas, poor shepherd!

2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. By and by.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I would I were at home.
  CELIA.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. We'll lead you thither.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND

OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

ORLANDO
JAQUES
KE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
  ORLANDO.

ORLANDO
JAQUES
LANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point

ORLANDO

QUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
  DUKE

ORLANDO
JAQUES

  ORLANDO. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
LANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
  DUKE 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
KE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
LANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
  DUKE 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
KE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
LANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
  DUKE 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES

  ORLANDO. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES

  DUKE

ORLANDO
JAQUES

  JAQUES. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
  JAQUES. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
  DUKE

ORLANDO

JAQUES
KE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
    Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
    That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
    Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
    And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt

    And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
    That every eye which in this forest looks
    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,

CORIN

  TOUCHSTONE.

CORIN
ORLANDO

CORIN

CORIN
ORLANDO

CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. No, truly.

CORIN
ORLANDO

CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on

2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO

CORIN
ORLANDO

2
CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A

CORIN
ORLANDO
RIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our

CORIN
ORLANDO
UCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good

CORIN

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
  CELIA. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too

ROSALIND
ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
QUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence

ROSALIND

CELIA
QUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
  JAQUES.

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Very well; what would you?

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Who stays it still withal?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
  ROSALIND.

TOUCHSTONE
DREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
  TOUCHSTONE. 
1
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
  AUDREY. 
1
TOUCHSTONE
DREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?

UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
    assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes

OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

2
CHARLES

2
CHARLES

2
CHARLES

ROSALIND
LIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I

1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
  CELIA. 
1
ROSALIND
LIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes

ROSALIND
SALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
    Nature.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. Were you made the messenger?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were

ROSALIND

  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
ROSALIND

  TOUCHSTONE.

ROSALIND

  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no

2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
    makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. With his mouth full of news.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
  CELIA.

ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,

ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE

ROSALIND

  LE 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
 BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. As wit and fortune will.
  TOUCHSTONE.

ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
UCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-

2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
  LE 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
 BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good

2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
SALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
  LE

ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
 BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
LIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
  LE 
2
ROSALIND
TOUCHSTONE
 BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

ROSALIND
FREDERICK
TOUCHSTONE
LANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
  FREDERICK.

ROSALIND

    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,

2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?

ORLANDO
JAQUES

  JAQUES. 
2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

CORIN
ORLANDO

CORIN

    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

OLIVER
ORLANDO
LANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

JAQUES
QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not on my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,

2
ORLANDO
JAQUES
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

ROSALIND

ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another

CELIA
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.

ROSALIND

ORLANDO

ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

ROSALIND

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his

3
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
CELIA
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND

    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare

SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
1
ROSALIND
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
    swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
ORLANDO
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO

  CELIA.

ROSALIND
LIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
  ROSALIND. 
1
ROSALIND
SALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of

  SILVIUS.

ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS.

ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
2
ROSALIND
SILVIUS
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND

ROSALIND
SILVIUS

ROSALIND
SILVIUS
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

  CELIA.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND.

  CELIA.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND.

ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
2
ROSALIND
OLIVER
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA.

ROSALIND
OLIVER

  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Were it not better,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;

  AMIENS.

IENS. Happy is your Grace,
  DUKE

KE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. Indeed, my lord,
  DUKE

KE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?
  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?
  SECOND

COND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting

  FIRST

  ADAM.

AM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Why, what's the matter?
  ADAM. 
0
AM. O unhappy youth!
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
  ADAM. 
0
AM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
  ADAM. 
0
AM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears
  ADAM. 
0
AM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.

UCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Who calls?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Else are they very wretched.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
  CORIN.

RIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

RIN. Fair sir, I pity her,

SALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
  CORIN.

RIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,

SALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,

  AMIENS.

IENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will
  AMIENS.

IENS. More at your request than to please myself.
  JAQUES.

QUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
  JAQUES.

QUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
  AMIENS.

IENS. And I'll sing it.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Thus it goes:
  AMIENS.

LANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
  DUKE

KE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;
  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
  DUKE

KE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. What fool is this?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. It is my only suit,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, I have eat none yet.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
  DUKE

KE SENIOR. Go find him out.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
  DUKE

QUES. All the world's a stage,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I thank you most for him.
  ADAM. 
0
AM. So had you need;
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
  DUKE

EDERICK. Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. No, truly.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Nay, I hope.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God

RIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I

UCHSTONE.   For a taste:
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

LIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Trow you who hath done this?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is it a man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I prithee, who?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, but who is it?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Is it possible?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let

SALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Orlando?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Orlando.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the

SALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Give me audience, good madam.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Proceed.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
  CELIA.

LIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
  CELIA.

LIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out

SALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
  CELIA.

LIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?

SALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Yes, just.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Just as high as my heart.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Very well; what would you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who stays it still withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
  JAQUES.

QUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Would you not have me honest?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] A material fool!
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger

0
RTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Will you be married, motley?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Something browner than Judas's.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you think so?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not true in love?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Well, and what of him?
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, come, let us remove!
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. I would not be thy executioner;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. O dear Phebe,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. But till that time
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. For no ill will I bear you.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. I would have you.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, that were covetousness.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. I'll write it straight;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
  LORD. 
0
RD. Sir, it was I.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
  LORD. 
0
RD. Yes, sir.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this railing?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this chiding?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. By and by.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would I were at home.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. We'll lead you thither.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy

LLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. William, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The
  WILLIAM.

LLIAM. I do, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
  WILLIAM.

  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a

LLIAM. Which he, sir?
  TOUCHSTONE.

LLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit

LANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should

IVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty

0
LANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
  ROSALIND.

  OLIVER.

IVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. It is my arm.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I

0
EBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
  PHEBE.

EBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
  PHEBE.

EBE. And I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. And I for no woman.

  ROSALIND.

SALIND. And I for no woman.

LVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And so am I for no woman.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
  PHEBE.

EBE. Nor I.

  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. So is the bargain.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
  SILVIUS.

UCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
  JAQUES.

QUES. And how was that ta'en up?
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more

0
 BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your

  LE

LANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,

  ROSALIND.

  CELIA.

LIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
  CELIA.

LIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

SALIND. Me, uncle?
  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. You, cousin.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
  ROSALIND.

  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
  CELIA.

LIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
  CELIA.

LIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have more cause.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. That he hath not.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
  CELIA.

LIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
  CELIA.

  ROSALIND.

UCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;

IENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will
  AMIENS.

IENS. More at your request than to please myself.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. And I'll sing it.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Thus it goes:
  AMIENS. 
0
IENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll

  ORLANDO.

LANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
  DUKE

KE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;
  FIRST

RST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
  DUKE

  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. What fool is this?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. It is my only suit,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, who cries out on pride
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, I have eat none yet.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Go find him out.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. All the world's a stage,
  JAQUES. 
1
ORLANDO
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
  DUKE

ORLANDO
KE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.

LANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
  CORIN.

RIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. No, truly.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Nay, I hope.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the

UCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
  CORIN.

RIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you

0
UCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
  CORIN.

RIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
  CORIN.

RIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.

UCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Trow you who hath done this?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is it a man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I prithee, who?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, but who is it?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Is it possible?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.

LIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

SALIND. Orlando?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Orlando.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too

QUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Yes, just.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Just as high as my heart.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur

SALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Very well; what would you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who stays it still withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you

UCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,

UCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most

UCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Would you not have me honest?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] A material fool!
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were

0
DREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;

QUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, the gods give us joy!

UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger

RTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Will you be married, motley?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all

0
SALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears

0
SALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Something browner than Judas's.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you think so?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not true in love?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no

SALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.

RIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
  CELIA.

EBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. I would have you.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, that were covetousness.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. I'll write it straight;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
  LORD. 
0
RD. Sir, it was I.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
  LORD. 
0
RD. Yes, sir.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this railing?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this chiding?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. By and by.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would I were at home.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. We'll lead you thither.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,

LLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. William, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The

LLIAM. I do, sir.

UCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?

LLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit

0
LANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. God save you, brother.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. It is my arm.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I

0
EBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. And I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And I for no woman.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. And I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And I for no woman.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And so am I for no woman.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Nor I.
  ORLANDO.

KE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. So is the bargain.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
  DUKE

  ORLANDO.

  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
  JAQUES.

QUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And how was that ta'en up?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. I like him very well.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
  JAQUES.

QUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
  DUKE

 BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your

  LE

SALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be

LANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,

  LE

 BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.
  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
  ORLANDO.

EDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
  CELIA.

LIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,

  ORLANDO.

LANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:

  CELIA.

LIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.

SALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my

0
LIA. Hem them away.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
  CELIA.

LIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
  CELIA.

SALIND. Me, uncle?
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You, cousin.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
  CELIA.

LIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have more cause.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. That he hath not.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Were it not better,
  CELIA.

LIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,

  DUKE

KE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Go find him out.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. All the world's a stage,
  JAQUES. 
1
ORLANDO
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
  DUKE

ORLANDO

  ORLANDO.

ORLANDO
LANDO. I thank you most for him.

ORLANDO
KE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
  DUKE

ORLANDO

ORLANDO
EDERICK. Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
  OLIVER.

IVER. O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
  FREDERICK.

ORLANDO
EDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. No, truly.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Nay, I hope.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God

RIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I

0
UCHSTONE.   For a taste:
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
  ROSALIND.

UCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest

  CELIA. 
0
LIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Trow you who hath done this?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is it a man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I prithee, who?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, but who is it?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Is it possible?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let

SALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Orlando?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Orlando.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the

LIA. Give me audience, good madam.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Proceed.
  CELIA.

QUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Yes, just.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Just as high as my heart.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Very well; what would you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who stays it still withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Would you not have me honest?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] A material fool!
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Will you be married, motley?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Something browner than Judas's.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you think so?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not true in love?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Well, and what of him?
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, come, let us remove!
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. I would not be thy executioner;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. O dear Phebe,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. But till that time
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. For no ill will I bear you.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. I would have you.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, that were covetousness.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. I'll write it straight;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
0

SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must

SALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst

0
LIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of

  LORD. 
0

QUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise

LIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this railing?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this chiding?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. By and by.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would I were at home.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. We'll lead you thither.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my

UCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
  AUDREY.

  AUDREY.

UCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and

0
SALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. It is my arm.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never

LANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke

SALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know

  ORLANDO.

LANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. And so am I for no woman.
  PHEBE.

EBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish

  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
  ROSALIND.

EBE. So is the bargain.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
  SILVIUS.

  TOUCHSTONE.

  TOUCHSTONE.

QUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on

UCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more

SALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
  CELIA.

LIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Were you made the messenger?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that

0
SALIND. With his mouth full of news.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Sport! of what colour?
  LE 
0
 BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. As wit and fortune will.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
  LE 
0
 BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
  LE 
0
 BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
  LE 
0
 BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by

 BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas!
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Or I, I promise thee.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
  LE 
0
 BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is yonder the man?
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Even he, madam.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And mine to eke out hers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Your heart's desires be with you!
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You shall try but one fall.
  CHARLES. 
0
ARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me

  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?
  LE 
0
 BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
  CELIA.

LIA. Gentle cousin,
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
  CELIA.

LIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
  CELIA.

LIA. Will you go, coz?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
    I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
  LE 
0
 BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should

0
LIA. But is all this for your father?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Hem them away.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I

  FREDERICK.

EDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Me, uncle?
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You, cousin.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
  FREDERICK. 
0
EDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have more cause.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. That he hath not.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Were it not better,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
  CELIA.

LIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;

  TOUCHSTONE.

SALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
  CELIA.

  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
  CORIN.

RIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.
  SILVIUS.

  CORIN. 
0
RIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
  CORIN.

RIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my

SALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break

  DUKE

  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. All the world's a stage,
  JAQUES. 
1
ORLANDO
QUES. All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

RIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our

UCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
  CORIN.

RIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.

UCHSTONE.   For a taste:
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

SALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a

UCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest

LIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with

UCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;

0
LIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Trow you who hath done this?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is it a man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I prithee, who?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, but who is it?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Is it possible?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.

SALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let

LIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Orlando?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Orlando.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too

SALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's

LIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the

QUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
  JAQUES.

QUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Yes, just.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I do not like her name.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. What stature is she of?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Just as high as my heart.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against

QUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am

QUES. There I shall see mine own figure.

SALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Very well; what would you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who stays it still withal?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Are you native of this place?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What were his marks?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you

UCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,

UCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most

0
DREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Would you not have me honest?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Aside] A material fool!
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;

QUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
  AUDREY. 
0
DREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger

RTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Will you be married, motley?
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
  MARTEXT. 
0
RTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears

0
SALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Something browner than Judas's.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Do you think so?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not true in love?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
  CELIA.

LIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave

RIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
  CELIA.

LIA. Well, and what of him?
  CORIN. 
0
RIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. O, come, let us remove!
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
  PHEBE.

EBE. I would not be thy executioner;
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. O dear Phebe,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. But till that time
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
  PHEBE.

EBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. For no ill will I bear you.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
  PHEBE.

EBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. I would have you.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Why, that were covetousness.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. I'll write it straight;
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Of a snail!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What's that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What, of my suit?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And wilt thou have me?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. What sayest thou?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Are you not good?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I hope so.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I cannot say the words.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I will.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, but when?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. For ever and a day.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. O, but she is wise.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never

0
LANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my

  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this railing?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. Call you this chiding?
  CELIA.

LIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. I pray you, tell it.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. And well he might so do,
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Are you his brother?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. By and by.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Look, he recovers.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I would I were at home.
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. We'll lead you thither.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
  OLIVER. 
0
IVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
  CELIA. 
0
LIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
  OLIVER.

UCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
  WILLIAM.

LLIAM. William, sir.
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
  WILLIAM. 
0
LLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and

LANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.

IVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. It is my arm.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
  ORLANDO.

LANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know

EBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
  PHEBE.

EBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;

EBE. And I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. And I for no woman.

  ROSALIND.

LVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And so am I for no woman.
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  SILVIUS. 
0
LVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish

LVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.

  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
  ORLANDO. 
0
LANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
  PHEBE. 
0
EBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
  ROSALIND.

SALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,
  PHEBE.

EBE. So is the bargain.
  ROSALIND. 
0
SALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
  SILVIUS.

LVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
  ROSALIND.

UCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
  JAQUES.

UCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
  JAQUES.

QUES. And how was that ta'en up?
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the

  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. I like him very well.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
  DUKE 
0
KE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
  JAQUES. 
0
QUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
  TOUCHSTONE. 
0
UCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
  JAQUES.

QUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
  TOUCHSTONE.

UCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor

UCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
