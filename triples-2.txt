Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ORLANDO

Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
OLIVER

Now, sir! what make you here?
ORLANDO
0
Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
OLIVER

What mar you then, sir?
ORLANDO
0
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a

Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
ORLANDO

Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What

Know you where you are, sir?
ORLANDO
0
O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
OLIVER

Know you before whom, sir?
ORLANDO
0
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
OLIVER

What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
ORLANDO

Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
OLIVER

Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
ORLANDO

I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de

I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father

And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
ORLANDO

I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
OLIVER

Get you with him, you old dog.
ADAM

Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in

So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access

Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and

Good morrow to your worship.
OLIVER

Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
CHARLES

There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
OLIVER

Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
CHARLES

O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,

Where will the old Duke live?
CHARLES

They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many

Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a

Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I
CELIA
0
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
ROSALIND
0
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
CELIA
0
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
ROSALIND
0
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
CELIA
0
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
ROSALIND
0
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
CELIA
0
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
ROSALIND
0
What shall be our sport, then?
CELIA
0
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
ROSALIND
0
I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
CELIA
0
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
ROSALIND
0
Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
CELIA
0
No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
ROSALIND
0
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
CELIA
0
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
TOUCHSTONE
0
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
CELIA
0
Were you made the messenger?
TOUCHSTONE
0
No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
ROSALIND
0
Where learned you that oath, fool?
TOUCHSTONE
0
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
CELIA
0
How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
ROSALIND
0
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
CELIA
0
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
TOUCHSTONE
0
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
CELIA
0
Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
TOUCHSTONE
0
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
CELIA
0
My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
TOUCHSTONE
0
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
CELIA
0
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
ROSALIND
0
With his mouth full of news.
CELIA
0
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
ROSALIND
0
Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
CELIA
0
All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
LE BEAU
0
Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
CELIA
0
Sport! of what colour?
LE BEAU
0
What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
ROSALIND
0
As wit and fortune will.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Or as the Destinies decrees.
CELIA
0
Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Nay, if I keep not my rank-
ROSALIND
0
Thou losest thy old smell.
LE BEAU
0
You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
ROSALIND
0
Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
LE BEAU
0
I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
CELIA
0
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
LE BEAU
0
There comes an old man and his three sons-
CELIA
0
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
LE BEAU
0
Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
ROSALIND
0
With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
LE BEAU
0
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
ROSALIND
0
Alas!
TOUCHSTONE
0
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
LE BEAU
0
Why, this that I speak of.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
CELIA
0
Or I, I promise thee.
ROSALIND
0
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
LE BEAU
0
You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
CELIA
0
Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
FREDERICK
0
Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
ROSALIND
0
Is yonder the man?
LE BEAU
0
Even he, madam.
CELIA
0
Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
FREDERICK
0
How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
ROSALIND
0
Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
FREDERICK
0
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
CELIA
0
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
FREDERICK
0
Do so; I'll not be by.
LE BEAU
0
Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
ORLANDO
0
I attend them with all respect and duty.
ROSALIND
0
Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
ORLANDO
0
No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
CELIA
0
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
ROSALIND
0
Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
ORLANDO
0
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
ROSALIND
0
The little strength that I have, I would it were with
CELIA
0
And mine to eke out hers.
ROSALIND
0
Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
CELIA
0
Your heart's desires be with you!
CHARLES
0
Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
ORLANDO
0
Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
FREDERICK
0
You shall try but one fall.
CHARLES
0
No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
ORLANDO
0
You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
ROSALIND
0
Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
CELIA
0
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
ROSALIND
0
O excellent young man!
CELIA
0
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should
FREDERICK
0
No more, no more.
ORLANDO
0
Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
FREDERICK
0
How dost thou, Charles?
LE BEAU
0
He cannot speak, my lord.
FREDERICK
0
Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
ORLANDO
0
Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
FREDERICK
0
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
CELIA
0
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
ORLANDO
0
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
ROSALIND
0
My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
CELIA
0
Gentle cousin,
ROSALIND
0
Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
CELIA
0
Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
ORLANDO
0
Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
ROSALIND
0
He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
CELIA
0
Will you go, coz?
ROSALIND
0
Have with you. Fare you well.
ORLANDO
0
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
ORLANDO
0
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
    I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
LE BEAU
0
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
ORLANDO
0
I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
LE BEAU
0
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
ORLANDO
0
I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
CELIA
0
Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
ROSALIND
0
Not one to throw at a dog.
CELIA
0
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
ROSALIND
0
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
CELIA
0
But is all this for your father?
ROSALIND
0
No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
CELIA
0
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
ROSALIND
0
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
CELIA
0
Hem them away.
ROSALIND
0
I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
CELIA
0
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
ROSALIND
0
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
CELIA
0
O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
ROSALIND
0
The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
CELIA
0
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
ROSALIND
0
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
CELIA
0
Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
ROSALIND
0
Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
CELIA
0
With his eyes full of anger.
FREDERICK
0
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
ROSALIND
0
Me, uncle?
FREDERICK
0
You, cousin.
ROSALIND
0
I do beseech your Grace,
FREDERICK
0
Thus do all traitors;
ROSALIND
0
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
FREDERICK
0
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
ROSALIND
0
SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
CELIA
0
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
FREDERICK
0
Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
CELIA
0
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
FREDERICK
0
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
CELIA
0
Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
FREDERICK
0
You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
CELIA
0
O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
ROSALIND
0
I have more cause.
CELIA
0
Thou hast not, cousin.
ROSALIND
0
That he hath not.
CELIA
0
No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
ROSALIND
0
Why, whither shall we go?
CELIA
0
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
ROSALIND
0
Alas, what danger will it be to us,
CELIA
0
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
ROSALIND
0
Were it not better,
CELIA
0
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
ROSALIND
0
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
CELIA
0
Something that hath a reference to my state:
ROSALIND
0
But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
CELIA
0
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
DUKE SENIOR
0
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
AMIENS
0
Happy is your Grace,
DUKE SENIOR
0
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
FIRST LORD
0
Indeed, my lord,
DUKE SENIOR
0
But what said Jaques?
FIRST LORD
0
O, yes, into a thousand similes.
DUKE SENIOR
0
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
SECOND LORD
0
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
DUKE SENIOR
0
Show me the place;
FIRST LORD
0
I'll bring you to him straight.             Exeunt
FREDERICK
0
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
FIRST LORD
0
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
SECOND LORD
0
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
FREDERICK
0
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
ORLANDO
0
Who's there?
ADAM
0
What, my young master? O my gentle master!
ORLANDO
0
Why, what's the matter?
ADAM
0
O unhappy youth!
ORLANDO
0
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
ADAM
0
No matter whither, so you come not here.
ORLANDO
0
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
ADAM
0
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
ORLANDO
0
O good old man, how well in thee appears
ADAM
0
Master, go on; and I will follow the
ROSALIND
0
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
TOUCHSTONE
0
I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
ROSALIND
0
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
CELIA
0
I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
TOUCHSTONE
0
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
ROSALIND
0
Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
ROSALIND
0
Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
CORIN
0
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
SILVIUS
0
O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
CORIN
0
I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
SILVIUS
0
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
CORIN
0
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
SILVIUS
0
O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
ROSALIND
0
Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
TOUCHSTONE
0
And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
ROSALIND
0
Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
ROSALIND
0
Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
TOUCHSTONE
0
And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
CELIA
0
I pray you, one of you question yond man
TOUCHSTONE
0
Holla, you clown!
ROSALIND
0
Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
CORIN
0
Who calls?
TOUCHSTONE
0
Your betters, sir.
CORIN
0
Else are they very wretched.
ROSALIND
0
Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
CORIN
0
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
ROSALIND
0
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
CORIN
0
Fair sir, I pity her,
ROSALIND
0
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
CORIN
0
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
ROSALIND
0
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
CELIA
0
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
CORIN
0
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
AMIENS
0
   Under the greenwood tree
JAQUES
0
More, more, I prithee, more.
AMIENS
0
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES
0
I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
AMIENS
0
My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
JAQUES
0
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
AMIENS
0
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
JAQUES
0
Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will
AMIENS
0
More at your request than to please myself.
JAQUES
0
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
AMIENS
0
Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
JAQUES
0
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
JAQUES
0
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
AMIENS
0
And I'll sing it.
JAQUES
0
Thus it goes:
AMIENS
0
What's that 'ducdame'?
JAQUES
0
'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll
AMIENS
0
And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
ADAM
0
Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
ORLANDO
0
Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
DUKE SENIOR
0
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
FIRST LORD
0
My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
DUKE SENIOR
0
If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
FIRST LORD
0
He saves my labour by his own approach.
DUKE SENIOR
0
Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
JAQUES
0
A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
DUKE SENIOR
0
What fool is this?
JAQUES
0
O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
DUKE SENIOR
0
Thou shalt have one.
JAQUES
0
It is my only suit,
DUKE SENIOR
0
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
JAQUES
0
What, for a counter, would I do but good?
DUKE SENIOR
0
Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
JAQUES
0
Why, who cries out on pride
ORLANDO
0
Forbear, and eat no more.
JAQUES
0
Why, I have eat none yet.
ORLANDO
0
Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
JAQUES
0
Of what kind should this cock come of?
DUKE SENIOR
0
Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
ORLANDO
0
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
JAQUES
0
An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
DUKE SENIOR
0
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
ORLANDO
0
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
DUKE SENIOR
0
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
ORLANDO
0
Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
DUKE SENIOR
0
True is it that we have seen better days,
ORLANDO
0
Then but forbear your food a little while,
DUKE SENIOR
0
Go find him out.
ORLANDO
0
I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
DUKE SENIOR
0
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
JAQUES
0
All the world's a stage,
JAQUES
1
ORLANDO
All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
DUKE SENIOR
1
ORLANDO
Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
ORLANDO
1
ORLANDO
I thank you most for him.
ADAM
1
ORLANDO
So had you need;
DUKE SENIOR
1
ORLANDO
Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
DUKE SENIOR
1
ORLANDO
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
FREDERICK
1
ORLANDO
Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
OLIVER
1
ORLANDO
O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
FREDERICK
1
ORLANDO
More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
ORLANDO
0
Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
CORIN
0
And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
TOUCHSTONE
0
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
CORIN
0
No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
TOUCHSTONE
0
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
CORIN
0
No, truly.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Then thou art damn'd.
CORIN
0
Nay, I hope.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
CORIN
0
For not being at court? Your reason.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
CORIN
0
Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
TOUCHSTONE
0
Instance, briefly; come, instance.
CORIN
0
Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
TOUCHSTONE
0
Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
CORIN
0
Besides, our hands are hard.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
CORIN
0
And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
TOUCHSTONE
0
Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
CORIN
0
You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God
CORIN
0
Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I

That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes

Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

  'From the east to western Inde,

I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and

Out, fool!

  For a taste:
ROSALIND
0
Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
ROSALIND
0
I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a
TOUCHSTONE

You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest

Peace!

  'Why should this a desert be?
ROSALIND

O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have
CELIA
0
How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
TOUCHSTONE
0
Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
CELIA
0
Didst thou hear these verses?
ROSALIND
0
O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
CELIA
0
That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
ROSALIND
0
Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
CELIA

But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
ROSALIND
0
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
CELIA
0
Trow you who hath done this?
ROSALIND
0
Is it a man?
CELIA
0
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
ROSALIND
0
I prithee, who?
CELIA
0
O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
ROSALIND
0
Nay, but who is it?
CELIA
0
Is it possible?
ROSALIND
0
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
CELIA
0
O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
ROSALIND
0
Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
CELIA
0
So you may put a man in your belly.
ROSALIND
0
Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
CELIA
0
Nay, he hath but a little beard.
ROSALIND
0
Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let
CELIA
0
It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
ROSALIND
0
Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
CELIA
0
I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
ROSALIND
0
Orlando?
CELIA
0
Orlando.
ROSALIND
0
Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
CELIA
0
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
ROSALIND
0
But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
CELIA
0
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
ROSALIND
0
It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
CELIA
0
Give me audience, good madam.
ROSALIND
0
Proceed.
CELIA
0
There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
ROSALIND
0
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
CELIA
0
Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
ROSALIND
0
O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
CELIA
0
I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
ROSALIND
0
Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
CELIA
0
You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
ROSALIND
0
'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
JAQUES
0
I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
ORLANDO
0
And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
JAQUES
0
God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
ORLANDO
0
I do desire we may be better strangers.
JAQUES
0
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
ORLANDO
0
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
JAQUES
0
Rosalind is your love's name?
ORLANDO
0
Yes, just.
JAQUES
0
I do not like her name.
ORLANDO
0
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
JAQUES
0
What stature is she of?
ORLANDO
0
Just as high as my heart.
JAQUES
0
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
ORLANDO
0
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
JAQUES
0
You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
ORLANDO
0
I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
JAQUES
0
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
ORLANDO
0
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
JAQUES
0
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
ORLANDO
0
He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
JAQUES
0
There I shall see mine own figure.
ORLANDO
0
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
JAQUES
0
I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
ORLANDO
0
I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
ROSALIND
0
[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
ORLANDO
0
Very well; what would you?
ROSALIND
0
I pray you, what is't o'clock?
ORLANDO
0
You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
ROSALIND
0
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
ORLANDO
0
And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
ROSALIND
0
By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
ORLANDO
0
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
ROSALIND
0
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
ORLANDO
0
Who ambles Time withal?
ROSALIND
0
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
ORLANDO
0
Who doth he gallop withal?
ROSALIND
0
With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
ORLANDO
0
Who stays it still withal?
ROSALIND
0
With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
ORLANDO
0
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
ROSALIND
0
With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
ORLANDO
0
Are you native of this place?
ROSALIND
0
As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
ORLANDO
0
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
ROSALIND
0
I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
ORLANDO
0
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
ROSALIND
0
There were none principal; they were all like one another
ORLANDO
0
I prithee recount some of them.
ROSALIND
0
No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
ORLANDO
0
I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
ROSALIND
0
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
ORLANDO
0
What were his marks?
ROSALIND
0
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
ORLANDO
0
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
ROSALIND
0
Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
ORLANDO
0
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
ROSALIND
0
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
ORLANDO
0
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
ROSALIND
0
Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
ORLANDO
0
Did you ever cure any so?
ROSALIND
0
Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
ORLANDO
0
I would not be cured, youth.
ROSALIND
0
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
ORLANDO
0
Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
ROSALIND
0
Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
ORLANDO
0
With all my heart, good youth.
ROSALIND
0
Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
TOUCHSTONE
0
Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
AUDREY
0
Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
TOUCHSTONE
0
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
JAQUES
0
[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
TOUCHSTONE
0
When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
AUDREY
0
I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
TOUCHSTONE
0
No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
AUDREY
0
Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
TOUCHSTONE
0
I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
AUDREY
0
Would you not have me honest?
TOUCHSTONE
0
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
JAQUES
0
[Aside] A material fool!
AUDREY
0
Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
TOUCHSTONE
0
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
AUDREY
0
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
JAQUES
0
[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
AUDREY
0
Well, the gods give us joy!
TOUCHSTONE
0
Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
MARTEXT
0
Is there none here to give the woman?
TOUCHSTONE
0
I will not take her on gift of any man.
MARTEXT
0
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
JAQUES
0
[Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
JAQUES
0
Will you be married, motley?
TOUCHSTONE
0
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
JAQUES
0
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
TOUCHSTONE
0
[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
JAQUES
0
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Come, sweet Audrey;
MARTEXT
0
'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
ROSALIND
0
Never talk to me; I will weep.
CELIA
0
Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
ROSALIND
0
But have I not cause to weep?
CELIA
0
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
ROSALIND
0
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
CELIA
0
Something browner than Judas's.
ROSALIND
0
I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
CELIA
0
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
ROSALIND
0
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
CELIA
0
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
ROSALIND
0
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
CELIA
0
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
ROSALIND
0
Do you think so?
CELIA
0
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
ROSALIND
0
Not true in love?
CELIA
0
Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
ROSALIND
0
You have heard him swear downright he was.
CELIA
0
'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
ROSALIND
0
I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
CELIA
0
O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
CORIN
0
Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
CELIA
0
Well, and what of him?
CORIN
0
If you will see a pageant truly play'd
ROSALIND
0
O, come, let us remove!
SILVIUS
0
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
PHEBE
0
I would not be thy executioner;
SILVIUS
0
O dear Phebe,
PHEBE
0
But till that time
ROSALIND
0
[Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
PHEBE
0
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
ROSALIND
0
He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
PHEBE
0
For no ill will I bear you.
ROSALIND
0
I pray you do not fall in love with me,
PHEBE
0
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
SILVIUS
0
Sweet Phebe.
PHEBE
0
Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
SILVIUS
0
Sweet Phebe, pity me.
PHEBE
0
Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
SILVIUS
0
Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
PHEBE
0
Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
SILVIUS
0
I would have you.
PHEBE
0
Why, that were covetousness.
SILVIUS
0
So holy and so perfect is my love,
PHEBE
0
Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
SILVIUS
0
Not very well; but I have met him oft;
PHEBE
0
Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
SILVIUS
0
Phebe, with all my heart.
PHEBE
0
I'll write it straight;
JAQUES
0
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
ROSALIND
0
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
JAQUES
0
I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
ROSALIND
0
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
JAQUES
0
Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
ROSALIND
0
Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
JAQUES
0
I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
ROSALIND
0
A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
JAQUES
0
Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
ROSALIND
0
And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
ORLANDO
0
Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
JAQUES
0
Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
ROSALIND
0
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
ORLANDO
0
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
ROSALIND
0
Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
ORLANDO
0
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
ROSALIND
0
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
ORLANDO
0
Of a snail!
ROSALIND
0
Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
ORLANDO
0
What's that?
ROSALIND
0
Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
ORLANDO
0
Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
ROSALIND
0
And I am your Rosalind.
CELIA
0
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
ROSALIND
0
Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
ORLANDO
0
I would kiss before I spoke.
ROSALIND
0
Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
ORLANDO
0
How if the kiss be denied?
ROSALIND
0
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
ORLANDO
0
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
ROSALIND
0
Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
ORLANDO
0
What, of my suit?
ROSALIND
0
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
ORLANDO
0
I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
ROSALIND
0
Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
ORLANDO
0
Then, in mine own person, I die.
ROSALIND
0
No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
ORLANDO
0
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
ROSALIND
0
By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
ORLANDO
0
Then love me, Rosalind.
ROSALIND
0
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
ORLANDO
0
And wilt thou have me?
ROSALIND
0
Ay, and twenty such.
ORLANDO
0
What sayest thou?
ROSALIND
0
Are you not good?
ORLANDO
0
I hope so.
ROSALIND
0
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
ORLANDO
0
Pray thee, marry us.
CELIA
0
I cannot say the words.
ROSALIND
0
You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
CELIA
0
Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
ORLANDO
0
I will.
ROSALIND
0
Ay, but when?
ORLANDO
0
Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
ROSALIND
0
Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
ORLANDO
0
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
ROSALIND
0
I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
ORLANDO
0
So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
ROSALIND
0
Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
ORLANDO
0
For ever and a day.
ROSALIND
0
Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
ORLANDO
0
But will my Rosalind do so?
ROSALIND
0
By my life, she will do as I do.
ORLANDO
0
O, but she is wise.
ROSALIND
0
Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
ORLANDO
0
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
ORLANDO
0
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
ROSALIND
0
Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
ORLANDO
0
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
ROSALIND
0
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
ORLANDO
0
I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
ROSALIND
0
Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
ORLANDO
0
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
ROSALIND
0
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
ORLANDO
0
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
ROSALIND
0
Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
CELIA
0
You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
ROSALIND
0
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
CELIA
0
Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
ROSALIND
0
No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
CELIA
0
And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt
JAQUES
0
Which is he that killed the deer?
LORD
0
Sir, it was I.
JAQUES
0
Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
LORD
0
Yes, sir.
JAQUES
0
Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
ROSALIND
0
How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
CELIA
0
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
SILVIUS
0
My errand is to you, fair youth;
ROSALIND
0
Patience herself would startle at this letter,
SILVIUS
0
No, I protest, I know not the contents;
ROSALIND
0
Come, come, you are a fool,
SILVIUS
0
Sure, it is hers.
ROSALIND
0
Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
SILVIUS
0
So please you, for I never heard it yet;
ROSALIND
0
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
SILVIUS
0
Call you this railing?
ROSALIND
0
'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
SILVIUS
0
Call you this chiding?
CELIA
0
Alas, poor shepherd!
ROSALIND
0
Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
OLIVER
0
Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
CELIA
0
West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
OLIVER
0
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
CELIA
0
It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
OLIVER
0
Orlando doth commend him to you both;
ROSALIND
0
I am. What must we understand by this?
OLIVER
0
Some of my shame; if you will know of me
CELIA
0
I pray you, tell it.
OLIVER
0
When last the young Orlando parted from you,
CELIA
0
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
OLIVER
0
And well he might so do,
ROSALIND
0
But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
OLIVER
0
Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
CELIA
0
Are you his brother?
ROSALIND
0
Was't you he rescu'd?
CELIA
0
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
OLIVER
0
'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
ROSALIND
0
But for the bloody napkin?
OLIVER
0
By and by.
CELIA
0
Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
OLIVER
0
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
CELIA
0
There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
OLIVER
0
Look, he recovers.
ROSALIND
0
I would I were at home.
CELIA
0
We'll lead you thither.
OLIVER
0
Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
ROSALIND
0
I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
OLIVER
0
This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
ROSALIND
0
Counterfeit, I assure you.
OLIVER
0
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
ROSALIND
0
So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
CELIA
0
Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
OLIVER
0
That will I, for I must bear answer back
ROSALIND
0
I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
TOUCHSTONE
0
We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
AUDREY
0
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
TOUCHSTONE

A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
AUDREY

Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the

And good ev'n to you, sir.
TOUCHSTONE

Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
WILLIAM
0
Five and twenty, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
0
A ripe age. Is thy name William?
WILLIAM
0
William, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
0
A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
WILLIAM
0
Ay, sir, I thank God.
TOUCHSTONE
0
'Thank God.' A good answer.
WILLIAM
0
Faith, sir, so so.
TOUCHSTONE
0
'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
WILLIAM
0
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The
WILLIAM
0
I do, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
WILLIAM
0
No, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
0
Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
WILLIAM
0
Which he, sir?
TOUCHSTONE
0
He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
AUDREY
0
Do, good William.
WILLIAM

God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit
CORIN

Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.

Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
ORLANDO
0
Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
OLIVER
0
Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
ORLANDO
0
You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
ROSALIND
0
God save you, brother.
OLIVER

And you, fair sister.                             Exit
ROSALIND

O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
ORLANDO
0
It is my arm.
ROSALIND
0
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
ORLANDO
0
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
ROSALIND
0
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
ORLANDO
0
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
ROSALIND
0
O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
ORLANDO
0
They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
ROSALIND
0
Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
ORLANDO
0
I can live no longer by thinking.
ROSALIND
0
I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
ORLANDO
0
Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
ROSALIND
0
By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
PHEBE
0
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
ROSALIND
0
I care not if I have. It is my study
PHEBE
0
Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
SILVIUS
0
It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
PHEBE
0
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO
0
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND
0
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS
0
It is to be all made of faith and service;
PHEBE
0
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO
0
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND
0
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS
0
It is to be all made of fantasy,
PHEBE
0
