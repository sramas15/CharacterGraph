What's here? One dead, or drunk?

O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!

Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
SECOND HUNTSMAN

It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.

Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.

Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
GREMIO
0
Why will you mew her up,
BAPTISTA
0
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
KATHERINA
0
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
GREMIO

You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
HORTENSIO
0
SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though
GREMIO
0
What's that, I pray?
HORTENSIO
0
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
GREMIO
0
A husband? a devil.
HORTENSIO
0
I say a husband.
GREMIO
0
I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father

Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to

Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
TRANIO
0
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
LUCENTIO
0
O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
TRANIO

Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
LUCENTIO

Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
TRANIO

Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.

Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
TRANIO

Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
LUCENTIO

I have it, Tranio.
TRANIO

Master, for my hand,

Tell me thine first.

You will be schoolmaster,

It is. May it be done?

Not possible; for who shall bear your part

Basta, content thee, for I have it full.

So had you need.                [They exchange habits]

GRUMIO
0
Help, masters, help! My master is mad.
PETRUCHIO
0
Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
HORTENSIO

How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my

HORTENSIO

Alla nostra casa ben venuto,

Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
HORTENSIO

Such wind as scatters young men through the world

O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
HORTENSIO

'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
GREMIO
0
Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
GRUMIO
0
And that his bags shall prove.
HORTENSIO
0
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
GREMIO
0
So said, so done, is well.
PETRUCHIO
0
I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
GREMIO
0
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
PETRUCHIO
0
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
GREMIO
0
O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
PETRUCHIO
0
Will I live?
GRUMIO
0
Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
PETRUCHIO
0
Why came I hither but to that intent?
GRUMIO
0
For he fears none.
GREMIO
0
Hortensio, hark:
HORTENSIO
0
I promis'd we would be contributors
GREMIO
0
And so we will- provided that he win her.
GRUMIO

I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
BIONDELLO

He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean?
TRANIO

Even he, Biondello.
GREMIO

Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
TRANIO
0
Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
PETRUCHIO
0
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
TRANIO
0
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
LUCENTIO

 [Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.
HORTENSIO
0
Sir, a word ere you go.
TRANIO
0
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
GREMIO
0
No; if without more words you will get you hence.
TRANIO
0
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
GREMIO
0
But so is not she.
TRANIO
0
For what reason, I beseech you?
GREMIO
0
For this reason, if you'll know,
HORTENSIO
0
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
TRANIO
0
Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
GREMIO
0
What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
LUCENTIO
0
Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
PETRUCHIO
0
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
HORTENSIO
0
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
TRANIO
0
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
PETRUCHIO
0
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
GREMIO
0
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
PETRUCHIO
0
Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:

0
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
HORTENSIO

Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.

And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
BAPTISTA
0
I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.
GREMIO
0
You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
PETRUCHIO
0
You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave.
BAPTISTA
0
Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
PETRUCHIO
0
I see you do not mean to part with her;
BAPTISTA
0
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
PETRUCHIO
0
Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
BAPTISTA
0
I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
GREMIO
0
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
PETRUCHIO

O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
GREMIO

I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
BAPTISTA
0
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.
TRANIO

Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
BAPTISTA

Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
TRANIO
0
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
BAPTISTA

A mighty man of Pisa. By report
PETRUCHIO

Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
BAPTISTA

After my death, the one half of my lands
PETRUCHIO

And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
BAPTISTA
0
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
PETRUCHIO
0
Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
BAPTISTA

Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
PETRUCHIO

Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
PETRUCHIO

HORTENSIO
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
    That shake not though they blow perpetually.
BAPTISTA

HORTENSIO
How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
HORTENSIO

HORTENSIO
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
BAPTISTA

What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
BAPTISTA

Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
HORTENSIO

HORTENSIO
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
PETRUCHIO

HORTENSIO
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
BAPTISTA
1
HORTENSIO
Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
I pray you do.             Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Why, what's a moveable?
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
A join'd-stool.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Should be! should- buzz!
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
My remedy is then to pluck it out.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
In his tongue.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Whose tongue?
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
That I'll try.                    [She strikes him]
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
So may you lose your arms.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
What is your crest- a coxcomb?
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
There is, there is.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Then show it me.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Had I a glass I would.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
What, you mean my face?
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Well aim'd of such a young one.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Yet you are wither'd.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
'Tis with cares.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
I care not.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Did ever Dian so become a grove
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
It is extempore, from my mother wit.
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
A witty mother! witless else her son.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Am I not wise?
KATHERINA
1
HORTENSIO
Yes, keep you warm.
PETRUCHIO
1
HORTENSIO
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
    And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
    Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
    That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
    And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
    Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
    For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
    Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
    Thou must be married to no man but me;
    For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
    And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
    Conformable as other household Kates.

PETRUCHIO

How but well, sir? how but well?

Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?

Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
KATHERINA

HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
BAPTISTA
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
PETRUCHIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
    I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
    We will have rings and things, and fine array;
    And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
                        Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
BAPTISTA
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
BAPTISTA
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
And I am one that love Bianca more
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
But thine doth fry.
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
BAPTISTA
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
First, as you know, my house within the city
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
BAPTISTA
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
I must confess your offer is the best;
TRANIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
GREMIO
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
And may not young men die as well as old?
BAPTISTA
2
HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
Well, gentlemen,
GREMIO
1
HORTENSIO
Adieu, good neighbour.                   Exit BAPTISTA
TRANIO
1
HORTENSIO
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
But, wrangling pedant, this is
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
That will be never- tune your instrument.
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Where left we last?
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Here, madam:
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Construe them.
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am Lucentio-
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois' I
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
Madam, 'tis now in tune.
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
All but the bass.
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
 [To LUCENTIO]  You may go walk and give me leave
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
Madam, before you touch the instrument
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
BIANCA

HORTENSIO

SERVANT
1
HORTENSIO
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
BIANCA
1
HORTENSIO
Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
                                       Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT
LUCENTIO
1
HORTENSIO
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
HORTENSIO
1
HORTENSIO
But I have cause to pry into this pedant;
BAPTISTA
0
 [To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
KATHERINA
0
No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
TRANIO
0
Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
KATHERINA
0
Would Katherine had never seen him though!
BAPTISTA
0
Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
BAPTISTA
0
Is it new and old too? How may that be?
BIONDELLO
0
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?
BAPTISTA
0
Is he come?
BIONDELLO
0
Why, no, sir.
BAPTISTA
0
What then?
BIONDELLO
0
He is coming.
BAPTISTA
0
When will he be here?
BIONDELLO
0
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
TRANIO
0
But, say, what to thine old news?
BIONDELLO
0
Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old
BAPTISTA
0
Who comes with him?
BIONDELLO
0
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like
TRANIO
0
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
BAPTISTA
0
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
BIONDELLO
0
Why, sir, he comes not.
BAPTISTA
0
Didst thou not say he comes?
BIONDELLO
0
Who? that Petruchio came?
BAPTISTA
0
Ay, that Petruchio came.
BIONDELLO
0
No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
BAPTISTA
0
Why, that's all one.
BIONDELLO
0
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
PETRUCHIO
0
Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
BAPTISTA
0
You are welcome, sir.
PETRUCHIO
0
And yet I come not well.
BAPTISTA
0
And yet you halt not.
TRANIO
0
Not so well apparell'd
PETRUCHIO
0
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
BAPTISTA
0
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.
TRANIO
0
And tell us what occasion of import
PETRUCHIO
0
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
TRANIO
0
See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
PETRUCHIO
0
Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
BAPTISTA
0
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
PETRUCHIO
0
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words;
TRANIO
0
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
BAPTISTA
0
I'll after him and see the event of this.
TRANIO
0
But to her love concerneth us to ad
LUCENTIO
0
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
TRANIO
0
That by degrees we mean to look into
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
That by degrees we mean to look into
    And watch our vantage in this business;
    We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
    The narrow-prying father, Minola,
    The quaint musician, amorous Licio-
    All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
What said the wench, when he rose again?
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
BAPTISTA
1
GREMIO
Is't possible you will away to-night?
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
I must away to-day before night come.
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
It may not be.
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
It cannot be.
KATHERINA
1
GREMIO
Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
I am content.
KATHERINA
1
GREMIO
Are you content to stay?
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
KATHERINA
1
GREMIO
Now, if you love me, stay.
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
Grumio, my horse.
GRUMIO
1
GREMIO
Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
KATHERINA
1
GREMIO
Nay, then,
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
KATHERINA
1
GREMIO
I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
KATHERINA
1
GREMIO
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
PETRUCHIO
1
GREMIO
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
    Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
    Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
    Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;
    Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
    But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
    Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
    I will be master of what is mine own-
    She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
    My household stuff, my field, my barn,
    My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
    And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
    I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
    That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
    Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
    Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
    Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
    I'll buckler thee against a million.
                         Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, and GRUMIO
BAPTISTA
1
GREMIO
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
Of all mad matches, never was the like.
LUCENTIO
1
GREMIO
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
BIANCA
1
GREMIO
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
GREMIO
1
GREMIO
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
BAPTISTA
1
GREMIO
Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
TRANIO
1
GREMIO
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
BAPTISTA
1
GREMIO
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
GRUMIO
0
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all
CURTIS
0
Who is that calls so coldly?
GRUMIO
0
A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
CURTIS
0
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
GRUMIO
0
O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
CURTIS
0
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
GRUMIO
0
She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou know'st
CURTIS
0
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
GRUMIO
0
Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long
CURTIS
0
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
GRUMIO
0
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
CURTIS
0
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
GRUMIO
0
Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
CURTIS
0
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
GRUMIO
0
Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
CURTIS
0
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
GRUMIO
0
First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fall'n
CURTIS
0
How?
GRUMIO
0
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a
CURTIS
0
Let's ha't, good Grumio.
GRUMIO
0
Lend thine ear.
CURTIS
0
Here.
GRUMIO
0
There.                                  [Striking him]
CURTIS
0
This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
GRUMIO
0
And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this cuff
CURTIS
0
Both of one horse?
GRUMIO
0
What's that to thee?
CURTIS
0
Why, a horse.
GRUMIO
0
Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
CURTIS
0
By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
GRUMIO
0
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find
CURTIS
0
They are.
GRUMIO
0
Call them forth.
CURTIS
0
Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to countenance my
GRUMIO
0
Why, she hath a face of her own.
CURTIS
0
Who knows not that?
GRUMIO
0
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
CURTIS
0
I call them forth to credit her.
GRUMIO
0
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
NATHANIEL
0
Welcome home, Grumio!
PHILIP
0
How now, Grumio!
JOSEPH
0
What, Grumio!
NICHOLAS
0
Fellow Grumio!
NATHANIEL
0
How now, old lad!
GRUMIO
0
Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!- and
NATHANIEL
0
All things is ready. How near is our master?
GRUMIO
0
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
PETRUCHIO
0
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
ALL SERVANTS
0
Here, here, sir; here, sir.
PETRUCHIO
0
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
GRUMIO
0
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
PETRUCHIO
0
YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
GRUMIO
0
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
PETRUCHIO
0
Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
PETRUCHIO
0
Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
                                   Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN
    [Sings]  Where is the life that late I led?
             Where are those-
    Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!
KATHERINA
0
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
PETRUCHIO
0
A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
FIRST SERVANT
0
Ay.
PETRUCHIO
0
Who brought it?
PETER
0
I.
PETRUCHIO
0
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
KATHERINA
0
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
PETRUCHIO
0
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
PETRUCHIO
0
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
    And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
    For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
    And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
    Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
    Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
    Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.
    And for this night we'll fast for company.
    Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.        Exeunt
NATHANIEL

Peter, didst ever see the like?
PETER
1
CURTIS
He kills her in her own humour.
GRUMIO
1
CURTIS
Where is he?
CURTIS
1
CURTIS
In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
CURTIS

PETRUCHIO
CURTIS
In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
    And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
    Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
    And sits as one new risen from a dream.
    Away, away! for he is coming hither.                  Exeunt

PETRUCHIO
CURTIS
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
TRANIO
0
Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
HORTENSIO
0
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
LUCENTIO
0
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
BIANCA
0
What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
LUCENTIO
0
I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
BIANCA
0
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
LUCENTIO
0
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
HORTENSIO
0
Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
TRANIO
0
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
HORTENSIO
0
Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
TRANIO
0
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
HORTENSIO
0
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
TRANIO
0
And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
HORTENSIO
0
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
TRANIO
0
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
BIANCA
0
Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
TRANIO
0
Mistress, we have.
LUCENTIO
0
Then we are rid of Licio.
TRANIO
0
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
BIANCA
0
God give him joy!
TRANIO
0
Ay, and he'll tame her.
BIANCA
0
He says so, Tranio.
TRANIO
0
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
BIANCA
0
The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
TRANIO
0
Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
BIONDELLO
0
O master, master, have watch'd so long
TRANIO
0
What is he, Biondello?
BIONDELLO
0
Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
LUCENTIO
0
And what of him, Tranio?
TRANIO
0
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
PEDANT
0
God save you, sir!
TRANIO
0
And you, sir; you are welcome.
PEDANT
0
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
TRANIO
0
What countryman, I pray?
PEDANT
0
Of Mantua.
TRANIO
0
Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
PEDANT
0
My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
TRANIO
0
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
PEDANT
0
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
TRANIO
0
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
PEDANT
0
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
TRANIO
0
Among them know you one Vincentio?
PEDANT
0
I know him not, but I have heard of him,
TRANIO
0
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
BIONDELLO
0
 [Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all
TRANIO
0
To save your life in this extremity,
PEDANT
0
O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
TRANIO
0
Then go with me to make the matter good.
GRUMIO
0
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
KATHERINA
0
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
GRUMIO
0
What say you to a neat's foot?
KATHERINA
0
'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
GRUMIO
0
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
KATHERINA
0
I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
GRUMIO
0
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
KATHERINA
0
A dish that I do love to feed upon.
GRUMIO
0
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
KATHERINA
0
Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
GRUMIO
0
Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
KATHERINA
0
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
GRUMIO
0
Why then the mustard without the beef.
KATHERINA
0
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
PETRUCHIO
0
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
HORTENSIO
0
Mistress, what cheer?
KATHERINA
0
Faith, as cold as can be.
PETRUCHIO
0
Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
KATHERINA
0
I pray you, let it stand.
PETRUCHIO
0
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
KATHERINA
0
I thank you, sir.
HORTENSIO
0
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
PETRUCHIO
0
 [Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.-
HABERDASHER
0
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
PETRUCHIO
0
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
KATHERINA
0
I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
PETRUCHIO
0
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
HORTENSIO
0
 [Aside]  That will not be in haste.
KATHERINA
0
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
PETRUCHIO
0
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
KATHERINA
0
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
PETRUCHIO
0
Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.
HORTENSIO
0
 [Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
TAILOR
0
You bid me make it orderly and well,
PETRUCHIO
0
Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,
KATHERINA
0
I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
PETRUCHIO
0
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
TAILOR
0
She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
PETRUCHIO
0
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou
TAILOR

Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
GRUMIO
0
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
TAILOR
0
But how did you desire it should be made?
GRUMIO
0
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
TAILOR
0
But did you not request to have it cut?
GRUMIO
0
Thou hast fac'd many things.
TAILOR
0
I have.
GRUMIO
0
Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I
TAILOR
0
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
PETRUCHIO
0
Read it.
GRUMIO
0
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
TAILOR
0
 [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
GRUMIO
0
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
PETRUCHIO

Proceed.
TAILOR
0
 [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
GRUMIO
0
I confess the cape.
TAILOR
0
 [Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
GRUMIO
0
I confess two sleeves.
TAILOR
0
 [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
PETRUCHIO
0
Ay, there's the villainy.
GRUMIO
0
Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded the
TAILOR
0
This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou
GRUMIO
0
I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
HORTENSIO
0
God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
PETRUCHIO
0
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
GRUMIO
0
You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.
PETRUCHIO
0
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
GRUMIO
0
Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown for
PETRUCHIO
0
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
GRUMIO
0
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
PETRUCHIO
0
 [Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.-
HORTENSIO
0
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;
PETRUCHIO
0
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
KATHERINA
0
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
PETRUCHIO
0
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
HORTENSIO
0
Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
TRANIO
0
Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
PEDANT
0
Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
TRANIO
0
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
PEDANT
0
I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
TRANIO
0
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
BIONDELLO
0
Tut, fear not me.
TRANIO
0
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
BIONDELLO
0
I told him that your father was at Venice,
TRANIO
0
Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
PEDANT
0
Soft, son!
BAPTISTA
0
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
TRANIO
0
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
BAPTISTA
0
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
TRANIO
0
Then at my lodging, an it like you.
BAPTISTA
0
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
BIONDELLO
0
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
TRANIO
0
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
BAPTISTA
1
LUCENTIO
I follow you.                                 Exeunt
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
Cambio.
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
What say'st thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
Biondello, what of that?
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
I pray thee moralize them.
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
And what of him?
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
And then?
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
And what of all this?
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
Hear'st thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO
1
LUCENTIO
I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon
LUCENTIO
1
LUCENTIO
I may and will, if she be so contented.
PETRUCHIO
0
Come on, a God's name; once more toward our father's.
KATHERINA
0
The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
PETRUCHIO
0
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KATHERINA
0
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRUCHIO
0
Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,
HORTENSIO
0
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
KATHERINA
0
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
PETRUCHIO
0
I say it is the moon.
KATHERINA
0
I know it is the moon.
PETRUCHIO
0
Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
KATHERINA
0
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;
HORTENSIO
0
Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
PETRUCHIO
0
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
HORTENSIO
0
'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
KATHERINA
0
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
PETRUCHIO
0
Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
KATHERINA
0
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
PETRUCHIO
0
Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
VINCENTIO
0
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
PETRUCHIO
0
What is his name?
VINCENTIO
0
Lucentio, gentle sir.
PETRUCHIO
0
Happily met; the happier for thy son.
VINCENTIO
0
But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
HORTENSIO
0
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
PETRUCHIO
0
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
HORTENSIO
0
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
BIONDELLO
0
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
LUCENTIO
0
I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need the at
BIONDELLO
0
Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and then
GREMIO
0
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
PETRUCHIO
0
Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
VINCENTIO
0
You shall not choose but drink before you go;
GREMIO
0
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
PEDANT
0
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
VINCENTIO
0
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
PEDANT
0
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
VINCENTIO
0
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make
PEDANT
0
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need none so
PETRUCHIO
0
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do
PEDANT
0
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking
VINCENTIO
0
Art thou his father?
PEDANT
0
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
PETRUCHIO
0
 [To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman!
PEDANT
0
Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
PEDANT
1
BIONDELLO
Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
    somebody in this city under my countenance.
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em
VINCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
 [Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
I hope I may choose, sir.
VINCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never
VINCENTIO

BIONDELLO
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see
VINCENTIO

BIONDELLO
Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
PEDANT
1
BIONDELLO
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above
PETRUCHIO

BIONDELLO
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of this

PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of this
    controversy.                              [They stand aside]
TRANIO

PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
VINCENTIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods!
TRANIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
How now! what's the matter?
BAPTISTA
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
What, is the man lunatic?
TRANIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but
VINCENTIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
BAPTISTA
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you
VINCENTIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him
PEDANT
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine
VINCENTIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold on
TRANIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Call forth an officer.
VINCENTIO

PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Carry me to the gaol!
GREMIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.
BAPTISTA
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.
GREMIO

PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd in
PEDANT

PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Swear if thou dar'st.
GREMIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Nay, I dare not swear it.
TRANIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
GREMIO
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
BAPTISTA
2
PEDANT
BIONDELLO
Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!

Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous

PEDANT
O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him, forswear
    him, or else we are all undone.
         Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and PEDANT, as fast as may be
LUCENTIO

PEDANT
 [Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
VINCENTIO

PEDANT
Lives my sweet son?
BIANCA
1
PEDANT
Pardon, dear father.
BAPTISTA
1
PEDANT
How hast thou offended?
LUCENTIO
1
PEDANT
Here's Lucentio,
GREMIO
1
PEDANT
Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
VINCENTIO
1
PEDANT
Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
BAPTISTA
1
PEDANT
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
BIANCA
1
PEDANT
Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
LUCENTIO
1
PEDANT
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
VINCENTIO
1
PEDANT
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to
BAPTISTA
1
PEDANT
 [To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you married my
VINCENTIO

PEDANT
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I

And I to sound the depth of this knavery.       Exit

Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

PEDANT
My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;
KATHERINA
1
PEDANT
Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
PETRUCHIO
1
PEDANT
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
KATHERINA
1
PEDANT
What, in the midst of the street?
PETRUCHIO
1
PEDANT
What, art thou asham'd of me?
KATHERINA
1
PEDANT
No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
PETRUCHIO
1
PEDANT
Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
KATHERINA
1
PEDANT
Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.
PETRUCHIO
1
PEDANT
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
LUCENTIO
0
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;
PETRUCHIO
0
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
BAPTISTA
0
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
PETRUCHIO
0
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
HORTENSIO
0
For both our sakes I would that word were true.
PETRUCHIO
0
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
WIDOW
0
Then never trust me if I be afeard.
PETRUCHIO
0
YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
WIDOW
0
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
PETRUCHIO
0
Roundly replied.
KATHERINA
0
Mistress, how mean you that?
WIDOW
0
Thus I conceive by him.
PETRUCHIO
0
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
HORTENSIO
0
My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
PETRUCHIO
0
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
KATHERINA
0
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'
WIDOW
0
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
KATHERINA
0
A very mean meaning.
WIDOW
0
Right, I mean you.
KATHERINA
0
And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.
PETRUCHIO
0
To her, Kate!
HORTENSIO
0
To her, widow!
PETRUCHIO
0
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
HORTENSIO
0
That's my office.
PETRUCHIO
0
Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.
BAPTISTA
0
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
GREMIO
0
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BIANCA
0
Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
VINCENTIO
0
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
BIANCA
0
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
PETRUCHIO
0
Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
BIANCA
0
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
PETRUCHIO
0
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
TRANIO
0
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
PETRUCHIO
0
A good swift simile, but something currish.
TRANIO
0
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
BAPTISTA
0
O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
LUCENTIO
0
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
HORTENSIO
0
Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
PETRUCHIO
0
'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;
BAPTISTA
0
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
PETRUCHIO
0
Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,
HORTENSIO
0
Content. What's the wager?
LUCENTIO
0
Twenty crowns.
PETRUCHIO
0
Twenty crowns?
LUCENTIO
0
A hundred then.
HORTENSIO
0
Content.
PETRUCHIO
0
A match! 'tis done.
HORTENSIO
0
Who shall begin?
LUCENTIO
0
That will I.
BIONDELLO
0
I go.                                          Exit
BAPTISTA
0
Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
Sir, my mistress sends you word
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
How! She's busy, and she cannot come!
GREMIO
1
BIONDELLO
Ay, and a kind one too.
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
I hope better.
HORTENSIO
1
BIONDELLO
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
PETRUCHIO
0
O, ho! entreat her!
HORTENSIO
0
I am afraid, sir,
HORTENSIO
1
BIONDELLO
I am afraid, sir,
    Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
BIONDELLO
1
BIONDELLO
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
    Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
    Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
    Say I command her come to me.                    Exit GRUMIO
HORTENSIO
1
BIONDELLO
I know her answer.
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
What?
HORTENSIO
1
BIONDELLO
She will not.
PETRUCHIO

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
BAPTISTA

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!
KATHERINA

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
What is your sir, that you send for me?
PETRUCHIO

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
KATHERINA
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
PETRUCHIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
    Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
    Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
                                                  Exit KATHERINA
LUCENTIO
1
BIONDELLO
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
HORTENSIO
1
BIONDELLO
And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
BAPTISTA

BIONDELLO
Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
PETRUCHIO
1
BIONDELLO
Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
PETRUCHIO

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
    And show more sign of her obedience,
    Her new-built virtue and obedience.
WIDOW

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
BIANCA
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
LUCENTIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
I would your duty were as foolish too;
BIANCA
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
The more fool you for laying on my duty.
PETRUCHIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
WIDOW
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
PETRUCHIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
WIDOW
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
She shall not.
PETRUCHIO

KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
I say she shall. And first begin with her.

Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
PETRUCHIO

BIONDELLO
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
LUCENTIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
VINCENTIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
LUCENTIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
PETRUCHIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
PETRUCHIO
2
KATHERINA
BIONDELLO
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
    We three are married, but you two are sped.
    [To LUCENTIO]  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
    And being a winner, God give you good night!

Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.

'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
