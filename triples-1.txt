PHILO
-1
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.
     Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,
                    with eunuchs fanning her
    Look where they come!
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd
    Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.

CLEOPATRA
-1
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

ANTONY
-1
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.

ANTONY
-1
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
                       Enter a MESSENGER

MESSENGER
-1
News, my good lord, from Rome.

ANTONY
-1
Grates me the sum.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Nay, hear them, Antony.
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
    His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
    Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
    Perform't, or else we damn thee.'

ANTONY
-1
How, my love?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Perchance? Nay, and most like,
    You must not stay here longer; your dismission
    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,
    Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
    Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

ANTONY
-1
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
    Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
    Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
    Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
    On pain of punishment, the world to weet
    We stand up peerless.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Excellent falsehood!
    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
    I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
    Will be himself.

ANTONY
-1
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
    Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;
    There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
    Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Hear the ambassadors.

ANTONY
-1
Fie, wrangling queen!
    Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,
    To weep; whose every passion fully strives
    To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.
    No messenger but thine, and all alone
    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
    Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.

DEMETRIUS
-1
Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?

PHILO
-1
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
    He comes too short of that great property
    Which still should go with Antony.

DEMETRIUS
-1
I am full sorry
    That he approves the common liar, who
    Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt

CHARMIAN
-1
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
    most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
    to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
    charge his horns with garlands!

ALEXAS
-1
Soothsayer!

SOOTHSAYER
-1
Your will?

CHARMIAN
-1
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?

SOOTHSAYER
-1
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
    A little I can read.

ALEXAS
-1
Show him your hand.
                       Enter ENOBARBUS

ENOBARBUS
-1
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
    Cleopatra's health to drink.

CHARMIAN
-1
Good, sir, give me good fortune.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
I make not, but foresee.

CHARMIAN
-1
Pray, then, foresee me one.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

CHARMIAN
-1
He means in flesh.

IRAS
-1
No, you shall paint when you are old.

CHARMIAN
-1
Wrinkles forbid!

ALEXAS
-1
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

CHARMIAN
-1
Hush!

SOOTHSAYER
-1
You shall be more beloving than beloved.

CHARMIAN
-1
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS
-1
Nay, hear him.

CHARMIAN
-1
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
    three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

CHARMIAN
-1
O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
    Than that which is to approach.

CHARMIAN
-1
Then belike my children shall have no names.
    Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

SOOTHSAYER
-1
If every of your wishes had a womb,
    And fertile every wish, a million.

CHARMIAN
-1
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

ALEXAS
-1
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

CHARMIAN
-1
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

ALEXAS
-1
We'll know all our fortunes.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-
    drunk to bed.

IRAS
-1
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

CHARMIAN
-1
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

IRAS
-1
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

CHARMIAN
-1
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
    cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
Your fortunes are alike.

IRAS
-1
But how, but how? Give me particulars.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
I have said.

IRAS
-1
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

CHARMIAN
-1
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
    where would you choose it?

IRAS
-1
Not in my husband's nose.

CHARMIAN
-1
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
    fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
    sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
    worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
    him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
    me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
    Isis, I beseech thee!

IRAS
-1
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
    it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
    a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

CHARMIAN
-1
Amen.

ALEXAS
-1
Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
    would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!
                          Enter CLEOPATRA

ENOBARBUS
-1
Hush! Here comes Antony.

CHARMIAN
-1
Not he; the Queen.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Saw you my lord?

ENOBARBUS
-1
No, lady.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Was he not here?

CHARMIAN
-1
No, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
    A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Madam?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?

ALEXAS
-1
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and FIRST ATTENDANT, SECOND ATTENDANT

CLEOPATRA
-1
We will not look upon him. Go with us.

MESSENGER
-1
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

ANTONY
-1
Against my brother Lucius?

MESSENGER
-1
Ay.
    But soon that war had end, and the time's state
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
    Whose better issue in the war from Italy
    Upon the first encounter drave them.

ANTONY
-1
Well, what worst?

MESSENGER
-1
The nature of bad news infects the teller.

ANTONY
-1
When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
    Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
    I hear him as he flatter'd.

MESSENGER
-1
Labienus-
    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
    Extended Asia from Euphrates,
    His conquering banner shook from Syria
    To Lydia and to Ionia,
    Whilst-

ANTONY
-1
Antony, thou wouldst say.

MESSENGER
-1
O, my lord!

ANTONY
-1
Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
    Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
    Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
    With such full licence as both truth and malice
    Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
    When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us
    Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

MESSENGER
-1
At your noble pleasure.                        Exit

ANTONY
-1
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

FIRST ATTENDANT
-1
The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?

SECOND ATTENDANT
-1
He stays upon your will.

ANTONY
-1
Let him appear.
    These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
    Or lose myself in dotage.
                 Enter SECOND MESSENGER with a letter
    What are you?

SECOND MESSENGER
-1
Fulvia thy wife is dead.

ANTONY
-1
Where died she?

SECOND MESSENGER
-1
In Sicyon.
    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
    Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]

ANTONY
-1
In Sicyon.
    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
    Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]

ANTONY
-1
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
    What our contempts doth often hurl from us
    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
    By revolution low'ring, does become
    The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
    The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
    I must from this enchanting queen break off.
    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!
                    Enter ENOBARBUS

ENOBARBUS
-1
What's your pleasure, sir?

ANTONY
-1
I must with haste from hence.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
    unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the
    word.

ANTONY
-1
I must be gone.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
    to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
    cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but
    the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die
    twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle
    in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
    celerity in dying.

ANTONY
-1
She is cunning past man's thought.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
    finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters
    sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than
    almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
    makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.

ANTONY
-1
Would I had never seen her!

ENOBARBUS
-1
O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
    work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
    your travel.

ANTONY
-1
Fulvia is dead.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Sir?

ANTONY
-1
Fulvia is dead.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Fulvia?

ANTONY
-1
Dead.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
    pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it
    shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
    when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If
    there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
    and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with
    consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and
    indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.

ANTONY
-1
The business she hath broached in the state
    Cannot endure my absence.

ENOBARBUS
-1
And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
    without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends
    on your abode.

ANTONY
-1
No more light answers. Let our officers
    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
    And get her leave to part. For not alone
    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
    Of many our contriving friends in Rome
    Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
    Pompey the Great and all his dignities
    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
    For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
    The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding
    Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
    And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
    To such whose place is under us, requires
    Our quick remove from hence.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I shall do't.                                Exeunt

CLEOPATRA
-1
Where is he?

CHARMIAN
-1
I did not see him since.

CLEOPATRA
-1
See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
    I did not send you. If you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report

CHARMIAN
-1
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
    You do not hold the method to enforce
    The like from him.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What should I do I do not?

CHARMIAN
-1
In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.

CHARMIAN
-1
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
    In time we hate that which we often fear.
                            Enter ANTONY
    But here comes Antony.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I am sick and sullen.

ANTONY
-1
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-

CLEOPATRA
-1
Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
    It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
    Will not sustain it.

ANTONY
-1
Now, my dearest queen-

CLEOPATRA
-1
Pray you, stand farther from me.

ANTONY
-1
What's the matter?

CLEOPATRA
-1
I know by that same eye there's some good news.
    What says the married woman? You may go.
    Would she had never given you leave to come!
    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
    I have no power upon you; hers you are.

ANTONY
-1
The gods best know-

CLEOPATRA
-1
O, never was there queen
    So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
    I saw the treasons planted.

ANTONY
-1
Cleopatra-

CLEOPATRA
-1
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
    Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
    To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
    Which break themselves in swearing!

ANTONY
-1
Most sweet queen-

CLEOPATRA
-1
Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
    But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
    Then was the time for words. No going then!
    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
    Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor
    But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
    Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
    Art turn'd the greatest liar.

ANTONY
-1
How now, lady!

CLEOPATRA
-1
I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
    There were a heart in Egypt.

ANTONY
-1
Hear me, queen:
    The strong necessity of time commands
    Our services awhile; but my full heart
    Remains in use with you. Our Italy
    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
    Equality of two domestic powers
    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
    Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
    Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
    By any desperate change. My more particular,
    And that which most with you should safe my going,
    Is Fulvia's death.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
     It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?

ANTONY
-1
She's dead, my Queen.
    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
    The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
    See when and where she died.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O most false love!
    Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
    In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.

ANTONY
-1
Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
    The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
    As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
    That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
    Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
    As thou affects.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
    But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-
    So Antony loves.

ANTONY
-1
My precious queen, forbear,
    And give true evidence to his love, which stands
    An honourable trial.

CLEOPATRA
-1
So Fulvia told me.
    I prithee turn aside and weep for her;
    Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
    Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
    Like perfect honour.

ANTONY
-1
You'll heat my blood; no more.

CLEOPATRA
-1
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

ANTONY
-1
Now, by my sword-

CLEOPATRA
-1
And target. Still he mends;
    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
    How this Herculean Roman does become
    The carriage of his chafe.

ANTONY
-1
I'll leave you, lady.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Courteous lord, one word.
    Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
    Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.
    That you know well. Something it is I would-
    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
    And I am all forgotten!

ANTONY
-1
But that your royalty
    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
    For idleness itself.

CLEOPATRA
-1
'Tis sweating labour
    To bear such idleness so near the heart
    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
    Since my becomings kill me when they do not
    Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;
    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
    And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
    Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
    Be strew'd before your feet!

ANTONY
-1
Let us go. Come.
    Our separation so abides and flies
    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
    Away!                                                 Exeunt

CAESAR
-1
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
    Our great competitor. From Alexandria
    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
    The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
    Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
    Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there
    A man who is the abstract of all faults
    That all men follow.

LEPIDUS
-1
I must not think there are
    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
    His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
    More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
    Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
    Than what he chooses.

CAESAR
-1
You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.
                   Enter a MESSENGER

LEPIDUS
-1
Here's more news.

MESSENGER
-1
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
    And it appears he is belov'd of those
    That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
    The discontents repair, and men's reports
    Give him much wrong'd.

CAESAR
-1
I should have known no less.
    It hath been taught us from the primal state
    That he which is was wish'd until he were;
    And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
    Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
    To rot itself with motion.

MESSENGER
-1
Caesar, I bring thee word
    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
    With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
    They make in Italy; the borders maritime
    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
    No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
    Than could his war resisted.

CAESAR
-1
Antony,
    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
    Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
    Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
    Though daintily brought up, with patience more
    Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
    The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
    Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
    The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
    Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
    The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps
    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
    Which some did die to look on. And all this-
    It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-
    Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
    So much as lank'd not.

LEPIDUS
-1
'Tis pity of him.

CAESAR
-1
Let his shames quickly
    Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
    Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
    Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
    Thrives in our idleness.

LEPIDUS
-1
To-morrow, Caesar,
    I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
    Both what by sea and land I can be able
    To front this present time.

CAESAR
-1
Till which encounter
    It is my business too. Farewell.

LEPIDUS
-1
Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
    To let me be partaker.

CAESAR
-1
Doubt not, sir;
    I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt

CLEOPATRA
-1
Charmian!

CHARMIAN
-1
Madam?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Ha, ha!
    Give me to drink mandragora.

CHARMIAN
-1
Why, madam?

CLEOPATRA
-1
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
    My Antony is away.

CHARMIAN
-1
You think of him too much.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O, 'tis treason!

CHARMIAN
-1
Madam, I trust, not so.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Thou, eunuch Mardian!

MARDIAN
-1
What's your Highness' pleasure?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
    In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
    May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

MARDIAN
-1
Yes, gracious madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Indeed?

MARDIAN
-1
Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
    But what indeed is honest to be done.
    Yet have I fierce affections, and think
    What Venus did with Mars.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
                         Enter ALEXAS

ALEXAS
-1
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

CLEOPATRA
-1
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
    Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
    With his tinct gilded thee.
    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

ALEXAS
-1
Last thing he did, dear Queen,
    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Mine ear must pluck it thence.

ALEXAS
-1
'Good friend,' quoth he
    'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
    To mend the petty present, I will piece
    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
    Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
    Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
    Was beastly dumb'd by him.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What, was he sad or merry?

ALEXAS
-1
Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
    Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
    He was not sad, for he would shine on those
    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
    In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
    O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
    The violence of either thee becomes,
    So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?

ALEXAS
-1
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
    Why do you send so thick?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Who's born that day
    When I forget to send to Antony
    Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
    Ever love Caesar so?

CHARMIAN
-1
O that brave Caesar!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
    Say 'the brave Antony.'

CHARMIAN
-1
The valiant Caesar!

CLEOPATRA
-1
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
    If thou with Caesar paragon again
    My man of men.

CHARMIAN
-1
By your most gracious pardon,
    I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA
-1
My salad days,
    When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
    To say as I said then. But come, away!
    Get me ink and paper.
    He shall have every day a several greeting,
    Or I'll unpeople Egypt.                               Exeunt

POMPEY
-1
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
    The deeds of justest men.

MENECRATES
-1
Know, worthy Pompey,
    That what they do delay they not deny.

POMPEY
-1
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
    The thing we sue for.

MENECRATES
-1
We, ignorant of ourselves,
    Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs
    Deny us for our good; so find we profit
    By losing of our prayers.

POMPEY
-1
I shall do well.
    The people love me, and the sea is mine;
    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
    Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
    He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
    Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
    Nor either cares for him.

MENAS
-1
Caesar and Lepidus
    Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.

POMPEY
-1
Where have you this? 'Tis false.

MENAS
-1
From Silvius, sir.

POMPEY
-1
He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-
                       Enter VARRIUS
    How now, Varrius!

VARRIUS
-1
This is most certain that I shall deliver:
    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
    Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
    A space for farther travel.

POMPEY
-1
I could have given less matter
    A better ear. Menas, I did not think
    This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
    For such a petty war; his soldiership
    Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
    The higher our opinion, that our stirring
    Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
    The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

MENAS
-1
I cannot hope
    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
    Not mov'd by Antony.

POMPEY
-1
I know not, Menas,
    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
    Were't not that we stand up against them all,
    'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
    For they have entertained cause enough
    To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
    May cement their divisions, and bind up
    The petty difference we yet not know.
    Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
    Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt

LEPIDUS
-1
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
    To soft and gentle speech.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I shall entreat him
    To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
    Let Antony look over Caesar's head
    And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
    Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
    I would not shave't to-day.

LEPIDUS
-1
'Tis not a time
    For private stomaching.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Every time
    Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

LEPIDUS
-1
But small to greater matters must give way.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Not if the small come first.

LEPIDUS
-1
Your speech is passion;
    But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
    The noble Antony.
                Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS

ENOBARBUS
-1
And yonder, Caesar.
            Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA

ANTONY
-1
If we compose well here, to Parthia.
    Hark, Ventidius.

CAESAR
-1
I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.

LEPIDUS
-1
Noble friends,
    That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
    A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
    May it be gently heard. When we debate
    Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
    Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
    The rather for I earnestly beseech,
    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
    Nor curstness grow to th' matter.

ANTONY
-1
'Tis spoken well.
    Were we before our arinies, and to fight,
    I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]

CAESAR
-1
Welcome to Rome.

ANTONY
-1
Thank you.

CAESAR
-1
Sit.

ANTONY
-1
Sit, sir.

CAESAR
-1
Nay, then.                                  [They sit]

ANTONY
-1
I learn you take things ill which are not so,
    Or being, concern you not.

CAESAR
-1
I must be laugh'd at
    If, or for nothing or a little,
    Should say myself offended, and with you
    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
    Once name you derogately when to sound your name
    It not concern'd me.

ANTONY
-1
My being in Egypt, Caesar,
    What was't to you?

CAESAR
-1
No more than my residing here at Rome
    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there
    Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
    Might be my question.

ANTONY
-1
How intend you- practis'd?

CAESAR
-1
You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
    By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
    Made wars upon me, and their contestation
    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.

ANTONY
-1
You do mistake your business; my brother never
    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
    And have my learning from some true reports
    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
    Discredit my authority with yours,
    And make the wars alike against my stomach,
    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
    As matter whole you have not to make it with,
    It must not be with this.

CAESAR
-1
You praise yourself
    By laying defects of judgment to me; but
    You patch'd up your excuses.

ANTONY
-1
Not so, not so;
    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
    Very necessity of this thought, that I,
    Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
    I would you had her spirit in such another!
    The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
    wars with the women!

ANTONY
-1
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
    Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
    But say I could not help it.

CAESAR
-1
I wrote to you
    When rioting in Alexandria; you
    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
    Did gibe my missive out of audience.

ANTONY
-1
Sir,
    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
    Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day
    I told him of myself, which was as much
    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
    Out of our question wipe him.

CAESAR
-1
You have broken
    The article of your oath, which you shall never
    Have tongue to charge me with.

LEPIDUS
-1
Soft, Caesar!

ANTONY
-1
No;
    Lepidus, let him speak.
    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
    Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
    The article of my oath-

CAESAR
-1
To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
    The which you both denied.

ANTONY
-1
Neglected, rather;
    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
    To stoop in such a case.

LEPIDUS
-1
'Tis noble spoken.

MAECENAS
-1
If it might please you to enforce no further
    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
    Were to remember that the present need
    Speaks to atone you.

LEPIDUS
-1
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
    do.

ANTONY
-1
Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.

ENOBARBUS
-1
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

ANTONY
-1
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Go to, then- your considerate stone!

CAESAR
-1
I do not much dislike the matter, but
    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
    So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
    O' th' world, I would pursue it.

AGRIPPA
-1
Give me leave, Caesar.

CAESAR
-1
Speak, Agrippa.

AGRIPPA
-1
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
    Is now a widower.

CAESAR
-1
Say not so, Agrippa.
    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
    Were well deserv'd of rashness.

ANTONY
-1
I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
    Agrippa further speak.

AGRIPPA
-1
To hold you in perpetual amity,
    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
    No worse a husband than the best of men;
    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
    That which none else can utter. By this marriage
    All little jealousies, which now seem great,
    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
    Would each to other, and all loves to both,
    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
    By duty ruminated.

ANTONY
-1
Will Caesar speak?

CAESAR
-1
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
    With what is spoke already.

ANTONY
-1
What power is in Agrippa,
    If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
    To make this good?

CAESAR
-1
The power of Caesar, and
    His power unto Octavia.

ANTONY
-1
May I never
    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
    Further this act of grace; and from this hour
    The heart of brothers govern in our loves
    And sway our great designs!

CAESAR
-1
There is my hand.
    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
    Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
    Fly off our loves again!

LEPIDUS
-1
Happily, amen!

ANTONY
-1
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
    Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
    At heel of that, defy him.

LEPIDUS
-1
Time calls upon's.
    Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
    Or else he seeks out us.

ANTONY
-1
Where lies he?

CAESAR
-1
About the Mount Misenum.

ANTONY
-1
What is his strength by land?

CAESAR
-1
Great and increasing; but by sea
    He is an absolute master.

ANTONY
-1
So is the fame.
    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
    The business we have talk'd of.

CAESAR
-1
With most gladness;
    And do invite you to my sister's view,
    Whither straight I'll lead you.

ANTONY
-1
Let us, Lepidus,
    Not lack your company.

LEPIDUS
-1
Noble Antony,
    Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]

MAECENAS
-1
Welcome from Egypt, sir.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
    friend, Agrippa!

AGRIPPA
-1
Good Enobarbus!

MAECENAS
-1
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
    the night light with drinking.

MAECENAS
-1
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
    twelve persons there. Is this true?

ENOBARBUS
-1
This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

MAECENAS
-1
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.

ENOBARBUS
-1
When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
    upon the river of Cydnus.

AGRIPPA
-1
There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
    her.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I will tell you.
    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
    Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;
    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
    The water which they beat to follow faster,
    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
    It beggar'd all description. She did lie
    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,
    O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
    The fancy out-work nature. On each side her
    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
    And what they undid did.

AGRIPPA
-1
O, rare for Antony!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
    So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
    And made their bends adornings. At the helm
    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
    That yarely frame the office. From the barge
    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
    Her people out upon her; and Antony,
    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
    Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
    And made a gap in nature.

AGRIPPA
-1
Rare Egyptian!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
    Invited her to supper. She replied
    It should be better he became her guest;
    Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
    And for his ordinary pays his heart
    For what his eyes eat only.

AGRIPPA
-1
Royal wench!
    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I saw her once
    Hop forty paces through the public street;
    And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
    That she did make defect perfection,
    And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.

MAECENAS
-1
Now Antony must leave her utterly.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Never! He will not.
    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
    Bless her when she is riggish.

MAECENAS
-1
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
    The heart of Antony, Octavia is
    A blessed lottery to him.

AGRIPPA
-1
Let us go.
    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
    Whilst you abide here.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt

ANTONY
-1
The world and my great office will sometimes
    Divide me from your bosom.

OCTAVIA
-1
All which time
    Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
    To them for you.

ANTONY
-1
Good night, sir. My Octavia,
    Read not my blemishes in the world's report.
    I have not kept my square; but that to come
    Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady.

OCTAVIA
-1
Good night, sir.

CAESAR
-1
Good night, sir.

ANTONY
-1
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?

SOOTHSAYER
-1
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!

ANTONY
-1
If you can- your reason.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
    yet hie you to Egypt again.

ANTONY
-1
Say to me,
    Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

SOOTHSAYER
-1
Caesar's.
    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
    Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
    Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
    Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
    Make space enough between you.

ANTONY
-1
Speak this no more.

SOOTHSAYER
-1
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
    If thou dost play with him at any game,
    Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
    He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
    When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
    Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
    But, he away, 'tis noble.

ANTONY
-1
Get thee gone.
    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.

LEPIDUS
-1
Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
    Your generals after.

AGRIPPA
-1
Sir, Mark Antony
    Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

LEPIDUS
-1
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
    Which will become you both, farewell.

MAECENAS
-1
We shall,
    As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
    Before you, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS
-1
Your way is shorter;
    My purposes do draw me much about.
    You'll win two days upon me.

BOTH
-1
Sir, good success!

LEPIDUS
-1
Farewell.                                      Exeunt

CLEOPATRA
-1
Give me some music- music, moody food
    Of us that trade in love.

ALL
-1
The music, ho!
                    Enter MARDIAN the eunuch

CLEOPATRA
-1
Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.

CHARMIAN
-1
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

CLEOPATRA
-1
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
    As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

MARDIAN
-1
As well as I can, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
    The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.
    Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,
    My music playing far off, I will betray
    Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
    Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
    I'll think them every one an Antony,
    And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'

CHARMIAN
-1
'Twas merry when
    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
    Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
    With fervency drew up.

CLEOPATRA
-1
That time? O times
    I laughed him out of patience; and that night
    I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
    I wore his sword Philippan.
                    Enter a MESSENGER
    O! from Italy?
    Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
    That long time have been barren.

MESSENGER
-1
Madam, madam-

CLEOPATRA
-1
Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
    Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
    If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
    My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings
    Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

MESSENGER
-1
First, madam, he is well.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Why, there's more gold.
    But, sirrah, mark, we use
    To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
    Down thy ill-uttering throat.

MESSENGER
-1
Good madam, hear me.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Well, go to, I will.
    But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony
    Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour
    To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,
    Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
    Not like a formal man.

MESSENGER
-1
Will't please you hear me?

CLEOPATRA
-1
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
    Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
    Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
    I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
    Rich pearls upon thee.

MESSENGER
-1
Madam, he's well.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Well said.

MESSENGER
-1
And friends with Caesar.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Th'art an honest man.

MESSENGER
-1
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Make thee a fortune from me.

MESSENGER
-1
But yet, madam-

CLEOPATRA
-1
I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
    The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
    'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
    Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
    Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
    The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;
    In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.

MESSENGER
-1
Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
    He's bound unto Octavia.

CLEOPATRA
-1
For what good turn?

MESSENGER
-1
For the best turn i' th' bed.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I am pale, Charmian.

MESSENGER
-1
Madam, he's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA
-1
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
                                              [Strikes him down]

MESSENGER
-1
Good madam, patience.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
    Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
    Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;
                                     [She hales him up and down]
    Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
    Smarting in ling'ring pickle.

MESSENGER
-1
Gracious madam,
    I that do bring the news made not the match.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
    And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
    Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
    And I will boot thee with what gift beside
    Thy modesty can beg.

MESSENGER
-1
He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]

MESSENGER
-1
Nay, then I'll run.
    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit

CHARMIAN
-1
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
    The man is innocent.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
    Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
    Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.
    Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!

CHARMIAN
-1
He is afear'd to come.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I will not hurt him.
    These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
    A meaner than myself; since I myself
    Have given myself the cause.
                    Enter the MESSENGER again
    Come hither, sir.
    Though it be honest, it is never good
    To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message
    An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
    Themselves when they be felt.

MESSENGER
-1
I have done my duty.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Is he married?
    I cannot hate thee worser than I do
    If thou again say 'Yes.'

MESSENGER
-1
He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?

MESSENGER
-1
Should I lie, madam?

CLEOPATRA
-1
O, I would thou didst,
    So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
    A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
    Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

MESSENGER
-1
I crave your Highness' pardon.

CLEOPATRA
-1
He is married?

MESSENGER
-1
Take no offence that I would not offend you;
    To punish me for what you make me do
    Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
    That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.
    The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
    Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,

CHARMIAN
-1
Good your Highness, patience.

CLEOPATRA
-1
In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.

CHARMIAN
-1
Many times, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
    I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
    Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
    Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
    Her inclination; let him not leave out
    The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.

POMPEY
-1
Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
    And we shall talk before we fight.

CAESAR
-1
Most meet
    That first we come to words; and therefore have we
    Our written purposes before us sent;
    Which if thou hast considered, let us know
    If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
    And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
    That else must perish here.

POMPEY
-1
To you all three,
    The senators alone of this great world,
    Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
    Wherefore my father should revengers want,
    Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
    Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
    There saw you labouring for him. What was't
    That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
    Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,
    With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
    To drench the Capitol, but that they would
    Have one man but a man? And that is it
    Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
    The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
    To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome
    Cast on my noble father.

CAESAR
-1
Take your time.

ANTONY
-1
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
    We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st
    How much we do o'er-count thee.

POMPEY
-1
At land, indeed,
    Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.
    But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
    Remain in't as thou mayst.

LEPIDUS
-1
Be pleas'd to tell us-
    For this is from the present- how you take
    The offers we have sent you.

CAESAR
-1
There's the point.

ANTONY
-1
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
    What it is worth embrac'd.

CAESAR
-1
And what may follow,
    To try a larger fortune.

POMPEY
-1
You have made me offer
    Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
    Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
    Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
    To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
    Our targes undinted.

ALL
-1
That's our offer.

POMPEY
-1
Know, then,
    I came before you here a man prepar'd
    To take this offer; but Mark Antony
    Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
    The praise of it by telling, you must know,
    When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
    Your mother came to Sicily and did find
    Her welcome friendly.

ANTONY
-1
I have heard it, Pompey,
    And am well studied for a liberal thanks
    Which I do owe you.

POMPEY
-1
Let me have your hand.
    I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

ANTONY
-1
The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
    That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
    For I have gained by't.

CAESAR
-1
Since I saw you last
    There is a change upon you.

POMPEY
-1
Well, I know not
    What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
    But in my bosom shall she never come
    To make my heart her vassal.

LEPIDUS
-1
Well met here.

POMPEY
-1
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
    I crave our composition may be written,
    And seal'd between us.

CAESAR
-1
That's the next to do.

POMPEY
-1
We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
    Draw lots who shall begin.

ANTONY
-1
That will I, Pompey.

POMPEY
-1
No, Antony, take the lot;
    But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
    Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
    Grew fat with feasting there.

ANTONY
-1
You have heard much.

POMPEY
-1
I have fair meanings, sir.

ANTONY
-1
And fair words to them.

POMPEY
-1
Then so much have I heard;
    And I have heard Apollodorus carried-

ENOBARBUS
-1
No more of that! He did so.

POMPEY
-1
What, I pray you?

ENOBARBUS
-1
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

POMPEY
-1
I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?

ENOBARBUS
-1
Well;
    And well am like to do, for I perceive
    Four feasts are toward.

POMPEY
-1
Let me shake thy hand.
    I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,
    When I have envied thy behaviour.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Sir,
    I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
    When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
    As I have said you did.

POMPEY
-1
Enjoy thy plainness;
    It nothing ill becomes thee.
    Aboard my galley I invite you all.
    Will you lead, lords?

ALL
-1
Show's the way, sir.

POMPEY
-1
Show's the way, sir.

MENAS
-1
[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
    treaty.- You and I have known, sir.

ENOBARBUS
-1
At sea, I think.

MENAS
-1
We have, sir.

ENOBARBUS
-1
You have done well by water.

MENAS
-1
And you by land.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it
    cannot be denied what I have done by land.

MENAS
-1
Nor what I have done by water.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
    have been a great thief by sea.

MENAS
-1
And you by land.

ENOBARBUS
-1
There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
    Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two
    thieves kissing.

MENAS
-1
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.

ENOBARBUS
-1
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

MENAS
-1
No slander: they steal hearts.

ENOBARBUS
-1
We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS
-1
For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
    Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

ENOBARBUS
-1
If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.

MENAS
-1
Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
    you, is he married to Cleopatra?

ENOBARBUS
-1
Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.

MENAS
-1
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

ENOBARBUS
-1
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS
-1
Pray ye, sir?

ENOBARBUS
-1
'Tis true.

MENAS
-1
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

ENOBARBUS
-1
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
    prophesy so.

MENAS
-1
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
    than the love of the parties.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems
    to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
    their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS
-1
Who would not have his wife so?

ENOBARBUS
-1
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He
    will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia
    blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is
    the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
    their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he
    married but his occasion here.

MENAS
-1
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
    health for you.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.

MENAS
-1
Come, let's away.                                Exeunt
                           SCENE VII.
             On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum
     Music plays. Enter FIRST SERVANT, SECOND SERVANT with a banquet

FIRST SERVANT
-1
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
    ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them
    down.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Lepidus is high-colour'd.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
They have made him drink alms-drink.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
    cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself
    to th' drink.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
But it raises the greater war between him and his
    discretion.

SECOND SERVANT
-1
Why, this it is to have a name in great men's
    fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service
    as a partizan I could not heave.

FIRST SERVANT
-1
To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
    to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully
    disaster the cheeks.
           A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
            POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,
                         with other CAPTAIN

ANTONY
-1
[To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
      Nile
    By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know
    By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
    Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
    The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
    And shortly comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS
-1
Y'have strange serpents there.

ANTONY
-1
Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS
-1
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
    operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.

ANTONY
-1
They are so.

POMPEY
-1
Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS
-1
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till
    then.

LEPIDUS
-1
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are
    very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.

MENAS
-1
[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

POMPEY
-1
[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?

MENAS
-1
[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
      Captain,
    And hear me speak a word.

POMPEY
-1
[ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
    This wine for Lepidus!

LEPIDUS
-1
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

ANTONY
-1
It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
    hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
    organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements
    once out of it, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS
-1
What colour is it of?

ANTONY
-1
Of it own colour too.

LEPIDUS
-1
'Tis a strange serpent.

ANTONY
-1
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

CAESAR
-1
Will this description satisfy him?

ANTONY
-1
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
    epicure.

POMPEY
-1
[Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
      Away!
    Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?

MENAS
-1
[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
      me,
    Rise from thy stool.

POMPEY
-1
[Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks
    aside] The matter?

MENAS
-1
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

POMPEY
-1
Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
    Be jolly, lords.

ANTONY
-1
These quicksands, Lepidus,
    Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS
-1
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY
-1
What say'st thou?

MENAS
-1
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY
-1
How should that be?

MENAS
-1
But entertain it,
    And though you think me poor, I am the man
    Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY
-1
Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS
-1
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
    Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;
    Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
    Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY
-1
Show me which way.

MENAS
-1
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
    Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
    All there is thine.

POMPEY
-1
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
    And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
    In thee't had been good service. Thou must know
    'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
    Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
    Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,
    I should have found it afterwards well done,
    But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS
-1
[Aside] For this,
    I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
    Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
    Shall never find it more.

POMPEY
-1
This health to Lepidus!

ANTONY
-1
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS
-1
Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY
-1
Fill till the cup be hid.

ENOBARBUS
-1
There's a strong fellow, Menas.
               [Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS]

MENAS
-1
Why?

ENOBARBUS
-1
'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?

MENAS
-1
The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
    That it might go on wheels!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS
-1
Come.

POMPEY
-1
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

ANTONY
-1
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
    Here's to Caesar!

CAESAR
-1
I could well forbear't.
    It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
    And it grows fouler.

ANTONY
-1
Be a child o' th' time.

CAESAR
-1
Possess it, I'll make answer.
    But I had rather fast from all four days
    Than drink so much in one.

ENOBARBUS
-1
[To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
    Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
    And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY
-1
Let's ha't, good soldier.

ANTONY
-1
Come, let's all take hands,
    Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
    In soft and delicate Lethe.

ENOBARBUS
-1
All take hands.
    Make battery to our ears with the loud music,
    The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;
    The holding every man shall bear as loud
    As his strong sides can volley.
               [Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand]
                        THE SONG
            Come, thou monarch of the vine,
            Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
            In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
            With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd.
            Cup us till the world go round,
            Cup us till the world go round!

CAESAR
-1
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
    Let me request you off; our graver business
    Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
    You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
    Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
    Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
    Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
    Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY
-1
I'll try you on the shore.

ANTONY
-1
And shall, sir. Give's your hand.

POMPEY
-1
O Antony,
    You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.
    Come, down into the boat.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Take heed you fall not.

MENAS
-1
No, to my cabin.
    These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
    Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
    To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!
                                  [Sound a flourish, with drums]

ENOBARBUS
-1
Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.

MENAS
-1
Hoo! Noble Captain, come.                        Exeunt
                     ACT III. SCENE I.
                     A plain in Syria
       Enter VENTIDIUS, as it were in triumph, with SILIUS
      and other Romans, OFFICERS and soldiers; the dead body
                of PACORUS borne before him

VENTIDIUS
-1
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
    Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
    Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
    Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
    Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS
-1
Noble Ventidius,
    Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
    The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
    Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
    The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
    Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
    Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS
-1
O Silius, Silius,
    I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
    May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:
    Better to leave undone than by our deed
    Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
    Caesar and Antony have ever won
    More in their officer, than person. Sossius,
    One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
    For quick accumulation of renown,
    Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.
    Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
    Than gain which darkens him.
    I could do more to do Antonius good,
    But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
    Should my performance perish.

SILIUS
-1
Thou hast, Ventidius, that
    Without the which a soldier and his sword
    Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?

VENTIDIUS
-1
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
    That magical word of war, we have effected;
    How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
    The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
    We have jaded out o' th' field.

SILIUS
-1
Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS
-1
He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
    The weight we must convey with's will permit,
    We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.
                                                          Exeunt
                            SCENE II. Rome. CAESAR'S house
        Enter AGRIPPA at one door, ENOBARBUS at another

AGRIPPA
-1
What, are the brothers parted?

ENOBARBUS
-1
They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
    The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
    Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
    With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA
-1
'Tis a noble Lepidus.

ENOBARBUS
-1
A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA
-1
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA
-1
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!

AGRIPPA
-1
O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.

AGRIPPA
-1
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

ENOBARBUS
-1
But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.
    Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-
    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
    Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA
-1
Both he loves.

ENOBARBUS
-1
They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets
      within] So-
    This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA
-1
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
           Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

ANTONY
-1
No further, sir.

CAESAR
-1
You take from me a great part of myself;
    Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
    Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
    Let not the piece of virtue which is set
    Betwixt us as the cement of our love
    To keep it builded be the ram to batter
    The fortress of it; for better might we
    Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
    This be not cherish'd.

ANTONY
-1
Make me not offended
    In your distrust.

CAESAR
-1
I have said.

ANTONY
-1
You shall not find,
    Though you be therein curious, the least cause
    For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
    And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
    We will here part.

CAESAR
-1
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
    The elements be kind to thee and make
    Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.

OCTAVIA
-1
My noble brother!

ANTONY
-1
The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,
    And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

OCTAVIA
-1
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-

CAESAR
-1
What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA
-1
I'll tell you in your ear.

ANTONY
-1
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
    Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather,
    That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,
    And neither way inclines.

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA
-1
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a
      horse;
    So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA
-1
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled
      with a rheum;
    What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
    Believe't- till I weep too.

CAESAR
-1
No, sweet Octavia,
    You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
    Out-go my thinking on you.

ANTONY
-1
Come, sir, come;
    I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
    And give you to the gods.

CAESAR
-1
Adieu; be happy!

LEPIDUS
-1
Let all the number of the stars give light
    To thy fair way!

CAESAR
-1
Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]

ANTONY
-1
Farewell!                       Trumpets sound. Exeunt
                          SCENE III.
              Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
         Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA
-1
Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS
-1
Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Go to, go to.
                Enter the MESSENGER as before
    Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS
-1
Good Majesty,
    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
    But when you are well pleas'd.

CLEOPATRA
-1
That Herod's head
    I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,
    Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

MESSENGER
-1
Most gracious Majesty!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Didst thou behold Octavia?

MESSENGER
-1
Ay, dread Queen.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Where?

MESSENGER
-1
Madam, in Rome
    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
    Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Is she as tall as me?

MESSENGER
-1
She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?

MESSENGER
-1
Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.

CLEOPATRA
-1
That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN
-1
Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
    What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
    If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

MESSENGER
-1
She creeps.
    Her motion and her station are as one;
    She shows a body rather than a life,
    A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Is this certain?

MESSENGER
-1
Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN
-1
Three in Egypt
    Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA
-1
He's very knowing;
    I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.
    The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN
-1
Excellent.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Guess at her years, I prithee.

MESSENGER
-1
Madam,
    She was a widow.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Widow? Charmian, hark!

MESSENGER
-1
And I do think she's thirty.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?

MESSENGER
-1
Round even to faultiness.

CLEOPATRA
-1
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
    Her hair, what colour?

MESSENGER
-1
Brown, madam; and her forehead
    As low as she would wish it.

CLEOPATRA
-1
There's gold for thee.
    Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
    I will employ thee back again; I find thee
    Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;

CHARMIAN
-1
A proper man.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
    That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
    This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN
-1
Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN
-1
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
    And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA
-1
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
    But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
    Where I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN
-1
I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt
                          SCENE IV.
                  Athens. ANTONY'S house
                 Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA

ANTONY
-1
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
    That were excusable, that and thousands more
    Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
    To public ear;
    Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not
    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
    He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
    When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
    Or did it from his teeth.

OCTAVIA
-1
O my good lord,
    Believe not all; or if you must believe,
    Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
    If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
    Praying for both parts.
    The good gods will mock me presently
    When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'
    Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
    'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
    Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way
    'Twixt these extremes at all.

ANTONY
-1
Gentle Octavia,
    Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
    Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,
    I lose myself; better I were not yours
    Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
    Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady,
    I'll raise the preparation of a war
    Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
    So your desires are yours.

OCTAVIA
-1
Thanks to my lord.
    The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,
    Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
    As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
    Should solder up the rift.

ANTONY
-1
When it appears to you where this begins,
    Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults
    Can never be so equal that your love
    Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
    Choose your own company, and command what cost
    Your heart has mind to.                               Exeunt
                           SCENE V.
                   Athens. ANTONY'S house
             Enter ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting

ENOBARBUS
-1
How now, friend Eros!

EROS
-1
There's strange news come, sir.

ENOBARBUS
-1
What, man?

EROS
-1
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

ENOBARBUS
-1
This is old. What is the success?

EROS
-1
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
    presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the
    glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters
    he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
    So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
    And throw between them all the food thou hast,
    They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS
-1
He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
    The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
    And threats the throat of that his officer
    That murd'red Pompey.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS
-1
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
    My lord desires you presently; my news
    I might have told hereafter.

ENOBARBUS
-1
'Twill be naught;
    But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS
-1
Come, sir.                                        Exeunt
                          SCENE VI.
                   Rome. CAESAR'S house
             Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS

CAESAR
-1
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
    In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:
    I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
    Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
    Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
    Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
    And all the unlawful issue that their lust
    Since then hath made between them. Unto her
    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
    Absolute queen.

MAECENAS
-1
This in the public eye?

CAESAR
-1
I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
    His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
    Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,
    He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
    Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
    In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
    That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
    As 'tis reported, so.

MAECENAS
-1
Let Rome be thus
    Inform'd.

AGRIPPA
-1
Who, queasy with his insolence
    Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

CAESAR
-1
The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
    His accusations.

AGRIPPA
-1
Who does he accuse?

CAESAR
-1
Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
    Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
    His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
    Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
    That Lepidus of the triumvirate
    Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
    All his revenue.

AGRIPPA
-1
Sir, this should be answer'd.

CAESAR
-1
'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
    I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
    That he his high authority abus'd,
    And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
    I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
    And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
    Demand the like.

MAECENAS
-1
He'll never yield to that.

CAESAR
-1
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
                Enter OCTAVIA, with her train

OCTAVIA
-1
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

CAESAR
-1
That ever I should call thee cast-away!

OCTAVIA
-1
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

CAESAR
-1
Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
    Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
    Should have an army for an usher, and
    The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
    Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
    Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
    Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
    Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
    A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
    The ostentation of our love, which left unshown
    Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you
    By sea and land, supplying every stage
    With an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA
-1
Good my lord,
    To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
    On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
    Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
    My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd
    His pardon for return.

CAESAR
-1
Which soon he granted,
    Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA
-1
Do not say so, my lord.

CAESAR
-1
I have eyes upon him,
    And his affairs come to me on the wind.
    Where is he now?

OCTAVIA
-1
My lord, in Athens.

CAESAR
-1
No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
    Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
    Up to a whore, who now are levying
    The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled
    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
    King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
    The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with
    More larger list of sceptres.

OCTAVIA
-1
Ay me most wretched,
    That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,
    That does afflict each other!

CAESAR
-1
Welcome hither.
    Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
    Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
    And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
    Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
    O'er your content these strong necessities,
    But let determin'd things to destiny
    Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
    Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
    Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
    To do you justice, make their ministers
    Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
    And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA
-1
Welcome, lady.

MAECENAS
-1
Welcome, dear madam.
    Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
    Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
    In his abominations, turns you off,
    And gives his potent regiment to a trull
    That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA
-1
Is it so, sir?

CAESAR
-1
Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
    Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!         Exeunt
                          SCENE VII.
                  ANTONY'S camp near Actium
                Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS

CLEOPATRA
-1
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

ENOBARBUS
-1
But why, why,

CLEOPATRA
-1
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
    And say'st it is not fit.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
    Be there in person?

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside] Well, I could reply:
    If we should serve with horse and mares together
    The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
    A soldier and his horse.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What is't you say?

ENOBARBUS
-1
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
    Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,
    What should not then be spar'd. He is already
    Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
    Manage this war.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
    That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
    And, as the president of my kingdom, will
    Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;
    I will not stay behind.
                   Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS

ENOBARBUS
-1
Nay, I have done.
    Here comes the Emperor.

ANTONY
-1
Is it not strange, Canidius,
    That from Tarentum and Brundusium
    He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
    And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Celerity is never more admir'd
    Than by the negligent.

ANTONY
-1
A good rebuke,
    Which might have well becom'd the best of men
    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
    Will fight with him by sea.

CLEOPATRA
-1
By sea! What else?

CANIDIUS
-1
Why will my lord do so?

ANTONY
-1
For that he dares us to't.

ENOBARBUS
-1
So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.

CANIDIUS
-1
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
    Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
    And so should you.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Your ships are not well mann'd;
    Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
    Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet
    Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;
    Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace
    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
    Being prepar'd for land.

ANTONY
-1
By sea, by sea.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
    The absolute soldiership you have by land;
    Distract your army, which doth most consist
    Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
    Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo
    The way which promises assurance; and
    Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
    From firm security.

ANTONY
-1
I'll fight at sea.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

ANTONY
-1
Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
    Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
    We then can do't at land.
                       Enter a MESSENGER
    Thy business?

MESSENGER
-1
The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
    Caesar has taken Toryne.

ANTONY
-1
Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
    Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
    And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
    Away, my Thetis!
                       Enter a SOLDIER
    How now, worthy soldier?

SOLDIER
-1
O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
    Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
    This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians
    And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
    Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth
    And fighting foot to foot.

ANTONY
-1
Well, well- away.

SOLDIER
-1
By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.

CANIDIUS
-1
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
    Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
    And we are women's men.

SOLDIER
-1
You keep by land
    The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

CANIDIUS
-1
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
    Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
    Carries beyond belief.

SOLDIER
-1
While he was yet in Rome,
    His power went out in such distractions as
    Beguil'd all spies.

CANIDIUS
-1
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

SOLDIER
-1
They say one Taurus.

CANIDIUS
-1
Well I know the man.
                        Enter a MESSENGER

MESSENGER
-1
The Emperor calls Canidius.

CANIDIUS
-1
With news the time's with labour and throes forth
    Each minute some.                                     Exeunt
                          SCENE VIII.
                      A plain near Actium
             Enter CAESAR, with his army, marching

CAESAR
-1
Taurus!

TAURUS
-1
My lord?

CAESAR
-1
Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle
    Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
    The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies
    Upon this jump.                                       Exeunt
                           SCENE IX.
                  Another part of the plain
                  Enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
-1
Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
    In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
    We may the number of the ships behold,
    And so proceed accordingly.                           Exeunt
                           SCENE X.
                 Another part of the plain
        CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way
        over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of
      CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard
                   the noise of a sea-fight
                    Alarum. Enter ENOBARBUS

ENOBARBUS
-1
Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
    Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
    With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
    To see't mine eyes are blasted.
                        Enter SCARUS

SCARUS
-1
Gods and goddesses,
    All the whole synod of them!

ENOBARBUS
-1
What's thy passion?

SCARUS
-1
The greater cantle of the world is lost
    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
    Kingdoms and provinces.

ENOBARBUS
-1
How appears the fight?

SCARUS
-1
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
    Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
    Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,
    When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
    Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-
    The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
    Hoists sails and flies.

ENOBARBUS
-1
That I beheld;
    Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
    Endure a further view.

SCARUS
-1
She once being loof'd,
    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
    Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
    I never saw an action of such shame;
    Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
    Did violate so itself.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Alack, alack!
                       Enter CANIDIUS

CANIDIUS
-1
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
    And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
    O, he has given example for our flight
    Most grossly by his own!

ENOBARBUS
-1
Ay, are you thereabouts?
    Why then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS
-1
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

SCARUS
-1
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
    What further comes.

CANIDIUS
-1
To Caesar will I render
    My legions and my horse; six kings already
    Show me the way of yielding.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I'll yet follow
    The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
    Sits in the wind against me.                          Exeunt
                         SCENE XI.
              Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
               Enter ANTONY With attendants

ANTONY
-1
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
    It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.
    I am so lated in the world that I
    Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship
    Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,
    And make your peace with Caesar.

ALL
-1
Fly? Not we!

ANTONY
-1
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
    I have myself resolv'd upon a course
    Which has no need of you; be gone.
    My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
    I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
    Have letters from me to some friends that will
    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
    Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
    Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;
    Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;
    Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]
            Enter CLEOPATRA, led by CHARMIAN and IRAS,
                         EROS following

EROS
-1
Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.

IRAS
-1
Do, most dear Queen.

CHARMIAN
-1
Do? Why, what else?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Let me sit down. O Juno!

ANTONY
-1
No, no, no, no, no.

EROS
-1
See you here, sir?

ANTONY
-1
O, fie, fie, fie!

CHARMIAN
-1
Madam!

IRAS
-1
Madam, O good Empress!

EROS
-1
Sir, sir!

ANTONY
-1
Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
    His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck
    The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
    That the mad Brutus ended; he alone
    Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had
    In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Ah, stand by!

EROS
-1
The Queen, my lord, the Queen!

IRAS
-1
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
    He is unqualitied with very shame.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Well then, sustain me. O!
    Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but
    Your comfort makes the rescue.

ANTONY
-1
I have offended reputation-
    A most unnoble swerving.

EROS
-1
Sir, the Queen.

ANTONY
-1
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
    How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
    By looking back what I have left behind
    'Stroy'd in dishonour.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O my lord, my lord,
    Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
    You would have followed.

ANTONY
-1
Egypt, thou knew'st too well
    My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,
    And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit
    Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
    Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
    Command me.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O, my pardon!

ANTONY
-1
Now I must
    To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
    And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
    With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,
    Making and marring fortunes. You did know
    How much you were my conqueror, and that
    My sword, made weak by my affection, would
    Obey it on all cause.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Pardon, pardon!

ANTONY
-1
Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
    All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;
    Even this repays me.
    We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?
    Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,
    Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
    We scorn her most when most she offers blows.         Exeunt
                         SCENE XII.
                   CAESAR'S camp in Egypt

CAESAR
-1
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
    Know you him?

DOLABELLA
-1
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
    An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
    He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
    Which had superfluous kings for messengers
    Not many moons gone by.
            Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY

CAESAR
-1
Approach, and speak.

EUPHRONIUS
-1
Such as I am, I come from Antony.
    I was of late as petty to his ends
    As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
    To his grand sea.

CAESAR
-1
Be't so. Declare thine office.

EUPHRONIUS
-1
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
    Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
    He lessens his requests and to thee sues
    To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
    A private man in Athens. This for him.
    Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
    Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
    The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
    Now hazarded to thy grace.

CAESAR
-1
For Antony,
    I have no ears to his request. The Queen
    Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
    From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
    Or take his life there. This if she perform,
    She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

EUPHRONIUS
-1
Fortune pursue thee!

CAESAR
-1
Fortune pursue thee!

THYREUS
-1
Caesar, I go.

CAESAR
-1
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
    And what thou think'st his very action speaks
    In every power that moves.

THYREUS
-1
Caesar, I shall.                               Exeunt
                           SCENE XIII.
               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
        Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS

CLEOPATRA
-1
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

ENOBARBUS
-1
Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Is Antony or we in fault for this?

ENOBARBUS
-1
Antony only, that would make his will
    Lord of his reason. What though you fled
    From that great face of war, whose several ranges
    Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
    The itch of his affection should not then
    Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
    When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
    The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
    Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
    And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Prithee, peace.
          Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY

ANTONY
-1
Is that his answer?

EUPHRONIUS
-1
Ay, my lord.

ANTONY
-1
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
    Will yield us up.

EUPHRONIUS
-1
He says so.

ANTONY
-1
Let her know't.
    To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
    And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
    With principalities.

CLEOPATRA
-1
That head, my lord?

ANTONY
-1
To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
    Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
    Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,
    May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
    Under the service of a child as soon
    As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore
    To lay his gay comparisons apart,
    And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
    Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.

EUPHRONIUS
-1
[Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
    Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
    His judgment too.
                       Enter a SERVANT

SERVANT
-1
A messenger from Caesar.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
    Against the blown rose may they stop their nose

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
    The loyalty well held to fools does make
    Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure
    To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
    And earns a place i' th' story.
                       Enter THYREUS

CLEOPATRA
-1
Caesar's will?

THYREUS
-1
Hear it apart.

CLEOPATRA
-1
None but friends: say boldly.

THYREUS
-1
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

ENOBARBUS
-1
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
    Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
    Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know
    Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.

THYREUS
-1
So.
    Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
    Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
    Further than he is Caesar.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Go on. Right royal!

THYREUS
-1
He knows that you embrace not Antony
    As you did love, but as you fear'd him.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O!

THYREUS
-1
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
    Not as deserv'd.

CLEOPATRA
-1
He is a god, and knows
    What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
    But conquer'd merely.

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside] To be sure of that,
    I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
    That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
    Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit

THYREUS
-1
Shall I say to Caesar
    What you require of him? For he partly begs
    To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
    That of his fortunes you should make a staff
    To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
    To hear from me you had left Antony,
    And put yourself under his shroud,
    The universal landlord.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What's your name?

THYREUS
-1
My name is Thyreus.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Most kind messenger,
    Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
    I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt
    To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.
    Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
    The doom of Egypt.

THYREUS
-1
'Tis your noblest course.
    Wisdom and fortune combating together,
    If that the former dare but what it can,
    No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
    My duty on your hand.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Your Caesar's father oft,
    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
    As it rain'd kisses.
                Enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
-1
Favours, by Jove that thunders!
    What art thou, fellow?

THYREUS
-1
One that but performs
    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
    To have command obey'd.

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside] You will be whipt.

ANTONY
-1
Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
    Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
    Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth
    And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
    Antony yet.
                       Enter servants
    Take hence this Jack and whip him.

ENOBARBUS
-1
'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
    Than with an old one dying.

ANTONY
-1
Moon and stars!
    Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
    That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
    So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name
    Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
    Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
    And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.

THYMUS
-1
Mark Antony-

ANTONY
-1
Tug him away. Being whipt,
    Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall

CLEOPATRA
-1
Good my lord-

ANTONY
-1
You have been a boggler ever.
    But when we in our viciousness grow hard-
    O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,
    In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
    Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
    To our confusion.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O, is't come to this?

ANTONY
-1
I found you as a morsel cold upon
    Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment
    Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
    Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
    Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,
    Though you can guess what temperance should be,
    You know not what it is.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Wherefore is this?

ANTONY
-1
To let a fellow that will take rewards,
    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
    And to proclaim it civilly were like
    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
    For being yare about him.
              Enter a SERVANT with THYREUS
    Is he whipt?

SERVANT
-1
Soundly, my lord.

ANTONY
-1
Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?

SERVANT
-1
He did ask favour.

ANTONY
-1
If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
    As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Have you done yet?

ANTONY
-1
Alack, our terrene moon
    Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone
    The fall of Antony.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I must stay his time.

ANTONY
-1
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
    With one that ties his points?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Not know me yet?

ANTONY
-1
Cold-hearted toward me?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Ah, dear, if I be so,
    From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
    And poison it in the source, and the first stone
    Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
    Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
    Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
    Together with my brave Egyptians all,
    By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
    Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
    Have buried them for prey.

ANTONY
-1
I am satisfied.
    Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
    I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
    Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
    Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
    Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
    If from the field I shall return once more
    To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
    I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
    There's hope in't yet.

CLEOPATRA
-1
That's my brave lord!

ANTONY
-1
I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
    And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
    Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
    Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
    And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
    Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
    All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
    Let's mock the midnight bell.

CLEOPATRA
-1
It is my birthday.
    I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
    Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

ANTONY
-1
We will yet do well.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Call all his noble captains to my lord.

ANTONY
-1
Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
    I'll make death love me; for I will contend

ENOBARBUS
-1
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
    A diminution in our captain's brain
    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,
    It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
    Some way to leave him.                                  Exit
                      ACT IV. SCENE I.
              CAESAR'S camp before Alexandria
      Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS, with his army;
                 CAESAR reading a letter

CAESAR
-1
He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
    To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
    He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,
    Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
    I have many other ways to die, meantime
    Laugh at his challenge.

MAECENAS
-1
Caesar must think
    When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
    Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
    Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
    Made good guard for itself.

CAESAR
-1
Let our best heads
    Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
    We mean to fight. Within our files there are
    Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late
    Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
    And feast the army; we have store to do't,
    And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!          Exeunt
                          SCENE II.
               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace
      Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS,
                     ALEXAS, with others

ANTONY
-1
He will not fight with me, Domitius?

ENOBARBUS
-1
No.

ANTONY
-1
Why should he not?

ENOBARBUS
-1
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
    He is twenty men to one.

ANTONY
-1
To-morrow, soldier,
    By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,
    Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
    Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

ENOBARBUS
-1
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

ANTONY
-1
Well said; come on.
    Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
    Be bounteous at our meal.
                Enter three or four servitors
    Give me thy hand,
    Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;
    Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,
    And kings have been your fellows.

CLEOPATRA
-1
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?

ENOBARBUS
-1
[Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which
      sorrow shoots
    Out of the mind.

ANTONY
-1
And thou art honest too.
    I wish I could be made so many men,
    And all of you clapp'd up together in
    An Antony, that I might do you service
    So good as you have done.

SERVANT
-1
The gods forbid!

ANTONY
-1
Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
    Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
    As when mine empire was your fellow too,
    And suffer'd my command.

CLEOPATRA
-1
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
    ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.

ANTONY
-1
Tend me to-night;
    May be it is the period of your duty.
    Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
    A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
    You'll serve another master. I look on you
    As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
    I turn you not away; but, like a master
    Married to your good service, stay till death.
    Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
    And the gods yield you for't!

ENOBARBUS
-1
What mean you, sir,
    To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
    And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!
    Transform us not to women.

ANTONY
-1
Ho, ho, ho!
    Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
    Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
    You take me in too dolorous a sense;
    For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
    To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
    I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
    Where rather I'll expect victorious life
    Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
    And drown consideration.                              Exeunt
                          SCENE III.
             Alexandria. Before CLEOPATRA's palace
                 Enter FIRST SOLDIER, SECOND SOLDIER, THIRD SOLDIER, FOURTH SOLDIER

FIRST SOLDIER
-1
Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
It will determine one way. Fare you well.
    Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

FIRST SOLDIER
-1
Nothing. What news?

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.

FIRST SOLDIER
-1
Well, sir, good night.
                                      [They meet other soldiers]

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
Soldiers, have careful watch.

FIRST SOLDIER
-1
And you. Good night, good night.
                [The two companies separate and place themselves
                                   in every corner of the stage]

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
Here we. And if to-morrow
    Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
    Our landmen will stand up.

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
'Tis a brave army,
    And full of purpose.
                      [Music of the hautboys is under the stage]

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
Peace, what noise?

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
List, list!

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
Hark!

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
Music i' th' air.

FOURTH SOLDIER
-1
Under the earth.

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
It signs well, does it not?

FOURTH SOLDIER
-1
No.

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
Peace, I say!
    What should this mean?

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
    Now leaves him.

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
    Do hear what we do.

SECOND SOLDIER
-1
How now, masters!

SOLDIERS
-1
[Speaking together] How now!
    How now! Do you hear this?

FIRST SOLDIER
-1
Ay; is't not strange?

THIRD SOLDIER
-1
Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?

FIRST SOLDIER
-1
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
    Let's see how it will give off.

SOLDIERS
-1
Content. 'Tis strange.                        Exeunt
                           SCENE IV.
               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace
         Enter ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS,
                          with others

ANTONY
-1
Eros! mine armour, Eros!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Sleep a little.

ANTONY
-1
No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
                   Enter EROS with armour
    Come, good fellow, put mine iron on.
    If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
    Because we brave her. Come.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Nay, I'll help too.
    What's this for?

ANTONY
-1
Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
    The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be.

ANTONY
-1
Well, well;
    We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
    Go put on thy defences.

EROS
-1
Briefly, sir.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Is not this buckled well?

ANTONY
-1
Rarely, rarely!
    He that unbuckles this, till we do please
    To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
    Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire
    More tight at this than thou. Dispatch. O love,
    That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
    The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
    A workman in't.
                   Enter an armed SOLDIER
    Good-morrow to thee. Welcome.
    Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.
    To business that we love we rise betime,
    And go to't with delight.

SOLDIER
-1
A thousand, sir,
    Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
    And at the port expect you.
                            [Shout. Flourish of trumpets within]
                 Enter CAPTAIN and soldiers

CAPTAIN
-1
The morn is fair. Good morrow, General.

ALL
-1
Good morrow, General.

ANTONY
-1
'Tis well blown, lads.
    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
    Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

CHARMIAN
-1
Please you retire to your chamber?

CLEOPATRA
-1
Lead me.
    He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
    Determine this great war in single fight!
    Then, Antony- but now. Well, on.                      Exeunt
                          SCENE V.
                  Alexandria. ANTONY'S camp
        Trumpets sound. Enter ANTONY and EROS, a SOLDIER
                       meeting them

SOLDIER
-1
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

ANTONY
-1
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
    To make me fight at land!

SOLDIER
-1
Hadst thou done so,
    The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
    That has this morning left thee, would have still
    Followed thy heels.

ANTONY
-1
Who's gone this morning?

SOLDIER
-1
Who?
    One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
    He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
    Say 'I am none of thine.'

ANTONY
-1
What say'st thou?

SOLDIER
-1
Sir,
    He is with Caesar.

EROS
-1
Sir, his chests and treasure
    He has not with him.

ANTONY
-1
Is he gone?

SOLDIER
-1
Most certain.

ANTONY
-1
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
    Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him-
    I will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;
    Say that I wish he never find more cause
    To change a master. O, my fortunes have
    Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus!            Exeunt
                         SCENE VI.
                 Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp
       Flourish. Enter AGRIPPA, CAESAR, With DOLABELLA
                       and ENOBARBUS

CAESAR
-1
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
    Our will is Antony be took alive;
    Make it so known.

AGRIPPA
-1
Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit

CAESAR
-1
The time of universal peace is near.
    Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world
    Shall bear the olive freely.
                     Enter A MESSENGER

MESSENGER
-1
Antony
    Is come into the field.

CAESAR
-1
Go charge Agrippa
    Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
    That Antony may seem to spend his fury

ENOBARBUS
-1
Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
    Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
    Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
    And leave his master Antony. For this pains
    Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
    That fell away have entertainment, but
    No honourable trust. I have done ill,
    Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
    That I will joy no more.
                  Enter a SOLDIER of CAESAR'S

SOLDIER
-1
Enobarbus, Antony
    Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
    His bounty overplus. The messenger
    Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
    Unloading of his mules.

ENOBARBUS
-1
I give it you.

SOLDIER
-1
Mock not, Enobarbus.
    I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer
    Out of the host. I must attend mine office,
    Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
    Continues still a Jove.                                 Exit

ENOBARBUS
-1
I am alone the villain of the earth,
    And feel I am so most. O Antony,
    Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
    My better service, when my turpitude
    Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
    If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
    Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.
    I fight against thee? No! I will go seek
    Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
    My latter part of life.                                 Exit
                          SCENE VII.
             Field of battle between the camps
         Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA
                        and others

AGRIPPA
-1
Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
    Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
    Exceeds what we expected.                             Exeunt
          Alarums. Enter ANTONY, and SCARUS wounded

SCARUS
-1
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
    Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
    With clouts about their heads.

ANTONY
-1
Thou bleed'st apace.

SCARUS
-1
I had a wound here that was like a T,
    But now 'tis made an H.

ANTONY
-1
They do retire.

SCARUS
-1
We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
    Room for six scotches more.
                        Enter EROS

EROS
-1
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
    For a fair victory.

SCARUS
-1
Let us score their backs
    And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
    'Tis sport to maul a runner.

ANTONY
-1
I will reward thee
    Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
    For thy good valour. Come thee on.
    SCARUS. I'll halt after.                              Exeunt
                         SCENE VIII.
               Under the walls of Alexandria
        Alarum. Enter ANTONY, again in a march; SCARUS
                        with others

ANTONY
-1
We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
    And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
    Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood
    That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
    For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
    Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been
    Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
    Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
    Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
    Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
    The honour'd gashes whole.
                 Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
    [To SCARUS] Give me thy hand-
    To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
    Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world,
    Chain mine arm'd neck. Leap thou, attire and all,
    Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
    Ride on the pants triumphing.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Lord of lords!
    O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
    The world's great snare uncaught?

ANTONY
-1
Mine nightingale,
    We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey
    Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
    A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
    Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
    Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand-
    Kiss it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day
    As if a god in hate of mankind had
    Destroyed in such a shape.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I'll give thee, friend,
    An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

ANTONY
-1
He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
    Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand.
    Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
    Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.
    Had our great palace the capacity
    To camp this host, we all would sup together,
    And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
    Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
    Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,
    That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
    Applauding our approach.                              Exeunt
                         SCENE IX.
                      CAESAR'S camp
      Enter a CENTURION and his company FIRST WATCH, SECOND WATCH; ENOBARBUS follows

CENTURION
-1
If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
    We must return to th' court of guard. The night
    Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
    By th' second hour i' th' morn.

FIRST WATCH
-1
This last day was
    A shrewd one to's.

ENOBARBUS
-1
O, bear me witness, night-

SECOND WATCH
-1
What man is this?

FIRST WATCH
-1
Stand close and list him.

ENOBARBUS
-1
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
    When men revolted shall upon record
    Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
    Before thy face repent!

CENTURION
-1
Enobarbus?

SECOND WATCH
-1
Peace!
    Hark further.

ENOBARBUS
-1
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
    The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
    That life, a very rebel to my will,
    May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
    Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
    Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
    And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
    Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
    Forgive me in thine own particular,
    But let the world rank me in register
    A master-leaver and a fugitive!
    O Antony! O Antony!                                   [Dies]

FIRST WATCH
-1
Let's speak to him.

CENTURION
-1
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
    May concern Caesar.

SECOND WATCH
-1
Let's do so. But he sleeps.

CENTURION
-1
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
    Was never yet for sleep.

FIRST WATCH
-1
Go we to him.

SECOND WATCH
-1
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

FIRST WATCH
-1
Hear you, sir?

CENTURION
-1
The hand of death hath raught him.
    [Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums
    Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
    To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
    Is fully out.

SECOND WATCH
-1
Come on, then;
    He may recover yet.                     Exeunt with the body
                          SCENE X.
                    Between the two camps
            Enter ANTONY and SCARUS, with their army

ANTONY
-1
Their preparation is to-day by sea;
    We please them not by land.

SCARUS
-1
For both, my lord.

ANTONY
-1
I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
    We'd fight there too. But this it is, our foot
    Upon the hills adjoining to the city
    Shall stay with us- Order for sea is given;
    They have put forth the haven-
    Where their appointment we may best discover
    And look on their endeavour.                          Exeunt
                         SCENE XI.
                    Between the camps
                Enter CAESAR and his army

CAESAR
-1
But being charg'd, we will be still by land,
    Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
    Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
    And hold our best advantage.                          Exeunt
                         SCENE XII.
                  A hill near Alexandria
                  Enter ANTONY and SCARUS

ANTONY
-1
Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
    I shall discover all. I'll bring thee word
    Straight how 'tis like to go.                           Exit

SCARUS
-1
Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
    His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
    Of what he has and has not.
                            [Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight]
                      Enter ANTONY

ANTONY
-1
All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,

CLEOPATRA
-1
Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?

ANTONY
-1
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up

CLEOPATRA
-1
Help me, my women. O, he is more mad
    Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
    Was never so emboss'd.

CHARMIAN
-1
To th'monument!
    There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
    The soul and body rive not more in parting
    Than greatness going off.

CLEOPATRA
-1
To th' monument!
    Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
    Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'
    And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
    And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
                                                          Exeunt
                          SCENE XIV.
                     CLEOPATRA'S palace
                   Enter ANTONY and EROS

ANTONY
-1
Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

EROS
-1
Ay, noble lord.

ANTONY
-1
Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
    A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
    A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
    A forked mountain, or blue promontory
    With trees upon't that nod unto the world
    And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
    They are black vesper's pageants.

EROS
-1
Ay, my lord.

ANTONY
-1
That which is now a horse, even with a thought
    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
    As water is in water.

EROS
-1
It does, my lord.

ANTONY
-1
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
    Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
    Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
    I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
    Unto an enemy's triumph.
    Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
    Ourselves to end ourselves.
                         Enter MARDIAN
    O, thy vile lady!
    She has robb'd me of my sword.

MARDIAN
-1
No, Antony;
    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
    With thine entirely.

ANTONY
-1
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
    She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.

MARDIAN
-1
Death of one person can be paid but once,
    And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
    Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
    Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
    The name of Antony; it was divided
    Between her heart and lips. She rend'red life,
    Thy name so buried in her.

ANTONY
-1
Dead then?

MARDIAN
-1
Dead.

ANTONY
-1
Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe

ANTONY
-1
Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit     Off, pluck off!
    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
    The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
    Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
    No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;

EROS
-1
What would my lord?

ANTONY
-1
Since Cleopatra died,
    I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
    Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
    Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
    With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
    The courage of a woman; less noble mind
    Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
    'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
    That, when the exigent should come- which now
    Is come indeed- when I should see behind me
    Th' inevitable prosecution of
    Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
    Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.
    Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
    Put colour in thy cheek.

EROS
-1
The gods withhold me!
    Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
    Though enemy, lost aim and could not?

ANTONY
-1
Eros,
    Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
    His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
    To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
    Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
    His baseness that ensued?

EROS
-1
I would not see't.

ANTONY
-1
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
    Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
    Most useful for thy country.

EROS
-1
O, sir, pardon me!

ANTONY
-1
When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
    Or thy precedent services are all
    But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.

EROS
-1
Turn from me then that noble countenance,
    Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

ANTONY
-1
Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]

EROS
-1
My sword is drawn.

ANTONY
-1
Then let it do at once
    The thing why thou hast drawn it.

EROS
-1
My dear master,
    My captain and my emperor, let me say,
    Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

ANTONY
-1
'Tis said, man; and farewell.

EROS
-1
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

ANTONY
-1
Now, Eros.

EROS
-1
Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow
    Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself

ANTONY
-1
Thrice nobler than myself!
    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
    A nobleness in record. But I will be
    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
    Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
                                          [Falling on his sword]
    I learn'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-
    The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
                  Enter DERCETAS and FIRST GUARD, SECOND GUARD, THIRD GUARD

FIRST GUARD
-1
What's the noise?

ANTONY
-1
I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
    Of what I have begun.

SECOND GUARD
-1
The star is fall'n.

FIRST GUARD
-1
And time is at his period.

ALL
-1
Alas, and woe!

ANTONY
-1
Let him that loves me, strike me dead.

FIRST GUARD
-1
Not I.

SECOND GUARD
-1
Nor I.

THIRD GUARD
-1
Nor I.

DERCETAS
-1
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
    This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
    Shall enter me with him.
                       Enter DIOMEDES

DIOMEDES
-1
Where's Antony?

DERCETAS
-1
There, Diomed, there.

DIOMEDES
-1
Lives he?

ANTONY
-1
Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
    Sufficing strokes for death.

DIOMEDES
-1
Most absolute lord,
    My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

ANTONY
-1
When did she send thee?

DIOMEDES
-1
Now, my lord.

ANTONY
-1
Where is she?

DIOMEDES
-1
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
    Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-
    Which never shall be found- you did suspect
    She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage
    Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
    But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
    Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
    I dread, too late.

ANTONY
-1
Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.

DIOMEDES
-1
What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho!
    Come, your lord calls!
             Enter FIRST GUARD, SECOND GUARD, THIRD GUARD, FOURTH GUARD

ANTONY
-1
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
    'Tis the last service that I shall command you.

FIRST GUARD
-1
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
    All your true followers out.

ALL
-1
Most heavy day!

ANTONY
-1
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
    To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome
    Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,
    Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.
    I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends,
    And have my thanks for all.           Exeunt, hearing ANTONY
                         SCENE XV.
                   Alexandria. A monument
      Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN
                         and IRAS

CLEOPATRA
-1
O Charmian, I will never go from hence!

CHARMIAN
-1
Be comforted, dear madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
No, I will not.
    All strange and terrible events are welcome,
    But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
    Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
    As that which makes it.
                   Enter DIOMEDES, below
    How now! Is he dead?

DIOMEDES
-1
His death's upon him, but not dead.
    Look out o' th' other side your monument;
    His guard have brought him thither.
            Enter, below, ANTONY, borne by the guard

CLEOPATRA
-1
O sun,
    Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand
    The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony,
    Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
    Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.

ANTONY
-1
Peace!
    Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
    But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.

CLEOPATRA
-1
So it should be, that none but Antony
    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

ANTONY
-1
I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
    I here importune death awhile, until
    Of many thousand kisses the poor last
    I lay upon thy lips.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I dare not, dear.
    Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,
    Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show
    Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall
    Be brooch'd with me. If knife, drugs, serpents, have
    Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
    Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
    And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
    Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony-
    Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
    Assist, good friends.

ANTONY
-1
O, quick, or I am gone.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
    Our strength is all gone into heaviness;
    That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
    The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
    And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
    Wishers were ever fools. O come, come,
                          [They heave ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
    And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
    Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
    Thus would I wear them out.

ALL
-1
A heavy sight!

ANTONY
-1
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
    Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

CLEOPATRA
-1
No, let me speak; and let me rail so high
    That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
    Provok'd by my offence.

ANTONY
-1
One word, sweet queen:
    Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!

CLEOPATRA
-1
They do not go together.

ANTONY
-1
Gentle, hear me:
    None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA
-1
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
    None about Caesar

ANTONY
-1
The miserable change now at my end
    Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
    In feeding them with those my former fortunes
    Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,
    The noblest; and do now not basely die,
    Not cowardly put off my helmet to
    My countryman- a Roman by a Roman
    Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going
    I can no more.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Noblest of men, woo't die?
    Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
    In this dull world, which in thy absence is
    No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]
    The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!
    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
    The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
    Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
    And there is nothing left remarkable
    Beneath the visiting moon.                          [Swoons]

CHARMIAN
-1
O, quietness, lady!

IRAS
-1
She's dead too, our sovereign.

CHARMIAN
-1
Lady!

IRAS
-1
Madam!

CHARMIAN
-1
O madam, madam, madam!

IRAS
-1
Royal Egypt, Empress!

CHARMIAN
-1
Peace, peace, Iras!

CLEOPATRA
-1
No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
    By such poor passion as the maid that milks
    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
    But resolution and the briefest end.
                   Exeunt; those above hearing off ANTONY'S body
                       ACT V. SCENE I.
                  Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp
      Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MAECENAS, GALLUS,
          PROCULEIUS, and others, his Council of War

CAESAR
-1
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
    Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
    The pauses that he makes.

DOLABELLA
-1
Caesar, I shall.                               Exit
             Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY

CAESAR
-1
Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
    Appear thus to us?

DERCETAS
-1
I am call'd Dercetas;
    Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
    Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
    He was my master, and I wore my life
    To spend upon his haters. If thou please
    To take me to thee, as I was to him
    I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
    I yield thee up my life.

CAESAR
-1
What is't thou say'st?

DERCETAS
-1
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

CAESAR
-1
The breaking of so great a thing should make
    A greater crack. The round world
    Should have shook lions into civil streets,
    And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
    Is not a single doom; in the name lay
    A moiety of the world.

DERCETAS
-1
He is dead, Caesar,
    Not by a public minister of justice,
    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
    Which writ his honour in the acts it did
    Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
    Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
    I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
    With his most noble blood.

CAESAR
-1
Look you sad, friends?
    The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
    To wash the eyes of kings.

AGRIPPA
-1
And strange it is
    That nature must compel us to lament
    Our most persisted deeds.

MAECENAS
-1
His taints and honours
    Wag'd equal with him.

AGRIPPA
-1
A rarer spirit never
    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us
    Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.

MAECENAS
-1
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
    He needs must see himself.

CAESAR
-1
O Antony,
    I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance
    Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
    Have shown to thee such a declining day
    Or look on thine; we could not stall together
    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
    That thou, my brother, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and companion in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
    Unreconciliable, should divide
    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-
                    Enter an EGYPTIAN
    But I will tell you at some meeter season.
    The business of this man looks out of him;
    We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?

EGYPTIAN
-1
A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,
    Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
    Of thy intents desires instruction,
    That she preparedly may frame herself
    To th' way she's forc'd to.

CAESAR
-1
Bid her have good heart.
    She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
    How honourable and how kindly we
    Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn
    To be ungentle.

EGYPTIAN
-1
So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit

CAESAR
-1
Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
    We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts
    The quality of her passion shall require,
    Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
    Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
    And with your speediest bring us what she says,
    And how you find her.

PROCULEIUS
-1
Caesar, I shall.                              Exit

CAESAR
-1
Caesar, I shall.                              Exit

ALL
-1
Dolabella!

CAESAR
-1
Let him alone, for I remember now
    How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.
    Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
    How hardly I was drawn into this war,
    How calm and gentle I proceeded still
    In all my writings. Go with me, and see
    What I can show in this.                              Exeunt
                         SCENE II.
                Alexandria. The monument
      Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

CLEOPATRA
-1
My desolation does begin to make
    A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
    Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
    A minister of her will; and it is great
    To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
    The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
       Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,
                          and soldiers

PROCULEIUS
-1
Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,
    And bids thee study on what fair demands
    Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What's thy name?

PROCULEIUS
-1
My name is Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Antony
    Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
    I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
    That have no use for trusting. If your master
    Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
    That majesty, to keep decorum, must
    No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
    To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
    He gives me so much of mine own as I
    Will kneel to him with thanks.

PROCULEIUS
-1
Be of good cheer;
    Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
    Make your full reference freely to my lord,
    Who is so full of grace that it flows over
    On all that need. Let me report to him
    Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
    A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
    Where he for grace is kneel'd to.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Pray you tell him
    I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
    The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
    A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
    Look him i' th' face.

PROCULEIUS
-1
This I'll report, dear lady.
    Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
    Of him that caus'd it.

GALLUS
-1
You see how easily she may be surpris'd.
      Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the
       monument by a ladder placed against a window,
       and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard
                unbar and open the gates
    Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit

IRAS
-1
Royal Queen!

CHARMIAN
-1
O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Quick, quick, good hands.        [Drawing a dagger]

PROCULEIUS
-1
Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
    Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
    Reliev'd, but not betray'd.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What, of death too,
    That rids our dogs of languish?

PROCULEIUS
-1
Cleopatra,
    Do not abuse my master's bounty by
    Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
    His nobleness well acted, which your death
    Will never let come forth.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Where art thou, death?
    Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
    Worth many babes and beggars!

PROCULEIUS
-1
O, temperance, lady!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;
    If idle talk will once be necessary,
    I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
    Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
    Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
    Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
    Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
    And show me to the shouting varletry
    Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
    Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud
    Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
    Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
    My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
    And hang me up in chains!

PROCULEIUS
-1
You do extend
    These thoughts of horror further than you shall
    Find cause in Caesar.
                      Enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA
-1
Proculeius,
    What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
    And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
    I'll take her to my guard.

PROCULEIUS
-1
So, Dolabella,
    It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
    [To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
    If you'll employ me to him.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Say I would die.

DOLABELLA
-1
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?

CLEOPATRA
-1
I cannot tell.

DOLABELLA
-1
Assuredly you know me.

CLEOPATRA
-1
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
    You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
    Is't not your trick?

DOLABELLA
-1
I understand not, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-
    O, such another sleep, that I might see
    But such another man!

DOLABELLA
-1
If it might please ye-

CLEOPATRA
-1
His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck
    A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
    The little O, the earth.

DOLABELLA
-1
Most sovereign creature-

CLEOPATRA
-1
His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
    Crested the world. His voice was propertied
    As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
    He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
    There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
    That grew the more by reaping. His delights
    Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above
    The element they liv'd in. In his livery
    Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
    As plates dropp'd from his pocket.

DOLABELLA
-1
Cleopatra-

CLEOPATRA
-1
Think you there was or might be such a man
    As this I dreamt of?

DOLABELLA
-1
Gentle madam, no.

CLEOPATRA
-1
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
    But if there be nor ever were one such,
    It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff
    To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
    An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
    Condemning shadows quite.

DOLABELLA
-1
Hear me, good madam.
    Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
    As answering to the weight. Would I might never
    O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
    By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
    My very heart at root.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I thank you, sir.
    Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

DOLABELLA
-1
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Nay, pray you, sir.

DOLABELLA
-1
Though he be honourable-

CLEOPATRA
-1
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

DOLABELLA
-1
Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
                              [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']
       Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
                     and others of his train

CAESAR
-1
Which is the Queen of Egypt?

DOLABELLA
-1
It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]

CAESAR
-1
Arise, you shall not kneel.
    I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Sir, the gods
    Will have it thus; my master and my lord
    I must obey.

CAESAR
-1
Take to you no hard thoughts.
    The record of what injuries you did us,
    Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
    As things but done by chance.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Sole sir o' th' world,
    I cannot project mine own cause so well
    To make it clear, but do confess I have
    Been laden with like frailties which before
    Have often sham'd our sex.

CAESAR
-1
Cleopatra, know
    We will extenuate rather than enforce.
    If you apply yourself to our intents-
    Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
    A benefit in this change; but if you seek
    To lay on me a cruelty by taking
    Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
    Of my good purposes, and put your children
    To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
    If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

CLEOPATRA
-1
And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,
    Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
    Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

CAESAR
-1
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

CLEOPATRA
-1
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
    I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,
    Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

SELEUCUS
-1
Here, madam.

CLEOPATRA
-1
This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,
    Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd
    To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

SELEUCUS
-1
Madam,
    I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
    Speak that which is not.

CLEOPATRA
-1
What have I kept back?

SELEUCUS
-1
Enough to purchase what you have made known.

CAESAR
-1
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
    Your wisdom in the deed.

CLEOPATRA
-1
See, Caesar! O, behold,
    How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;
    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
    Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust
    Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
    Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes
    Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
    O rarely base!

CAESAR
-1
Good Queen, let us entreat you.

CLEOPATRA
-1
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
    That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
    Doing the honour of thy lordliness
    To one so meek, that mine own servant should
    Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
    Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
    That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
    Immoment toys, things of such dignity
    As we greet modern friends withal; and say
    Some nobler token I have kept apart
    For Livia and Octavia, to induce
    Their mediation- must I be unfolded
    With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
    Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;
    Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
    Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
    Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

CAESAR
-1

CLEOPATRA
-1
Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
    For things that others do; and when we fall
    We answer others' merits in our name,
    Are therefore to be pitied.

CAESAR
-1
Cleopatra,
    Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
    Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours,
    Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
    Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
    Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
    Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;
    For we intend so to dispose you as
    Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
    Our care and pity is so much upon you
    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.

CLEOPATRA
-1
My master and my lord!

CAESAR
-1
Not so. Adieu.

CLEOPATRA
-1
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
    Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!
                                             [Whispers CHARMIAN]

IRAS
-1
Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
    And we are for the dark.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Hie thee again.
    I have spoke already, and it is provided;
    Go put it to the haste.

CHARMIAN
-1
Madam, I will.
                      Enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA
-1
Where's the Queen?

CHARMIAN
-1
Behold, sir.                                    Exit

CLEOPATRA
-1
Dolabella!

DOLABELLA
-1
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
    Which my love makes religion to obey,
    I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
    Intends his journey, and within three days
    You with your children will he send before.
    Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
    Your pleasure and my promise.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Dolabella,
    I shall remain your debtor.

DOLABELLA
-1
I your servant.
    Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.

CLEOPATRA
-1
I your servant.
    Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.

IRAS
-1
The gods forbid!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
    Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
    Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
    Extemporally will stage us, and present
    Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
    Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
    Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
    I' th' posture of a whore.

IRAS
-1
O the good gods!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Nay, that's certain.

IRAS
-1
I'll never see't, for I am sure mine nails
    Are stronger than mine eyes.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Why, that's the way
    To fool their preparation and to conquer
    Their most absurd intents.
                      Enter CHARMIAN
    Now, Charmian!
    Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch
    My best attires. I am again for Cydnus,
    To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.
    Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
    And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
    To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.

GUARDSMAN
-1
Here is a rural fellow
    That will not be denied your Highness' presence.
    He brings you figs.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Here is a rural fellow
    That will not be denied your Highness' presence.
    He brings you figs.

GUARDSMAN
-1
This is the man.

CLEOPATRA
-1
This is the man.

CLOWN
-1
Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should
    desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
    do die of it do seldom or never recover.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Remember'st thou any that have died on't?

CLOWN
-1
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no
    longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given
    to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how
    she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes
    a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that
    they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is
    most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Get thee hence; farewell.

CLOWN
-1
I wish you all joy of the worm.
                                          [Sets down the basket]

CLEOPATRA
-1
Farewell.

CLOWN
-1
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his
    kind.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Ay, ay; farewell.

CLOWN
-1
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
    of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

CLOWN
-1
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
    the feeding.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Will it eat me?

CLOWN
-1
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
    himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for
    the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same
    whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
    every ten that they make the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Well, get thee gone; farewell.

CLOWN
-1
Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th' worm.         Exit
             Enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c.

CLEOPATRA
-1
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
    Immortal longings in me. Now no more
    The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
    Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
    Antony call. I see him rouse himself
    To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
    The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
    To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come.
    Now to that name my courage prove my title!
    I am fire and air; my other elements
    I give to baser life. So, have you done?
    Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
    Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.
                              [Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
    If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
    The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
    Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
    If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
    It is not worth leave-taking.

CHARMIAN
-1
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
    The gods themselves do weep.

CLEOPATRA
-1
This proves me base.
    If she first meet the curled Antony,
    He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
    Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
                    [To an asp, which she applies to her breast]
    With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
    Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
    Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,
    That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
    Unpolicied!

CHARMIAN
-1
O Eastern star!

CLEOPATRA
-1
Peace, peace!
    Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
    That sucks the nurse asleep?

CHARMIAN
-1
O, break! O, break!

CLEOPATRA
-1
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-
    O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:
                               [Applying another asp to her arm]
    What should I stay-                                   [Dies]

CHARMIAN
-1
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
    Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
    A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
    And golden Phoebus never be beheld
    Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
    I'll mend it and then play-
                  Enter the guard, rushing in

FIRST GUARD
-1
Where's the Queen?

CHARMIAN
-1
Speak softly, wake her not.

FIRST GUARD
-1
Caesar hath sent-

CHARMIAN
-1
Too slow a messenger.               [Applies an asp]
    O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.

FIRST GUARD
-1
Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.

SECOND GUARD
-1
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.

FIRST GUARD
-1
What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?

CHARMIAN
-1
It is well done, and fitting for a princes
    Descended of so many royal kings.
    Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]
                      Enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA
-1
How goes it here?

SECOND GUARD
-1
All dead.

DOLABELLA
-1
Caesar, thy thoughts
    Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
    To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
    So sought'st to hinder.
                      [Within: 'A way there, a way for Caesar!']
              Enter CAESAR and all his train

DOLABELLA
-1
O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
    That you did fear is done.

CAESAR
-1
Bravest at the last,
    She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
    Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
    I do not see them bleed.

DOLABELLA
-1
Who was last with them?

FIRST GUARD
-1
A simple countryman that brought her figs.
    This was his basket.

CAESAR
-1
Poison'd then.

FIRST GUARD
-1
O Caesar,
    This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood and spake.
    I found her trimming up the diadem
    On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,
    And on the sudden dropp'd.

CAESAR
-1
O noble weakness!
    If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
    By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
    As she would catch another Antony
    In her strong toil of grace.

DOLABELLA
-1
Here on her breast
    There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
    The like is on her arm.

FIRST GUARD
-1
This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
    Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves
    Upon the caves of Nile.
