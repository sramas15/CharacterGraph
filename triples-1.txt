DEMETRIUS
ANTONY
ILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.
  CLEOPATRA.

    No messenger but thine, and all alone
    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;

    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Charmian!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. Who's born that day
  CHARMIAN. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
ARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
  CHARMIAN. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
ARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  CHARMIAN.

2
POMPEY
VARRIUS
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-
  VARRIUS.

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. I wrote to you

3
ANTONY

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. No;

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  LEPIDUS. 
3
ANTONY

3
ANTONY
CAESAR

RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA.

ANTONY

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR

ANTONY

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA.

ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Let us go.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

POMPEY
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS.

POMPEY
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS.

    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,

    That thou, my brother, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and companion in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,

    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-

    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
2

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY

ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY

ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

  POMPEY.

  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
1

    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,

    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
    I did not send you. If you find him sad,

  CHARMIAN.

CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not

2
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
MESSENGER
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.
  LEPIDUS.

  CHARMIAN.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS.

ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?

MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,

ENOBARBUS

  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY

ANTONY

ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR

ANTONY

ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA.

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA.

ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Let us go.

ANTONY

OBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt

    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,

    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
    But resolution and the briefest end.

    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.

    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well

OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made

ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but

ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. I will tell you.

    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever

    And though I make this marriage for my peace,

    Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
    His judgment too.

    The loyalty well held to fools does make

    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar

    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,

    Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
    On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
    That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
    O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
    Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
    Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-

TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA
    'Tis well th'art gone,
    If it be well to live; but better 'twere
    Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
    Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
    The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
    Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
    And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
    Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.
    To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
    Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho!              Exit

OS. Ay, noble lord.
  ANTONY.

OS. It does, my lord.

TONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
    Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
    Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
    I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
    Unto an enemy's triumph.
    Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
    Ourselves to end ourselves.
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. No, Antony;

TONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
    Off, pluck off!
    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
    The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
    Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
    No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
    You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.        Exit EROS
    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
  EROS.

OS. What would my lord?

OS. My dear master,

TONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
  EROS.

OS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, Eros.

0
OS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
    A nobleness in record. But I will be
    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
    Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
                                          [Falling on his sword]

    Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,

EOPATRA. No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
    By such poor passion as the maid that milks
    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
    But resolution and the briefest end.

    Or look on thine; we could not stall together
    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
    That thou, my brother, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and companion in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
    Unreconciliable, should divide
    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-

    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,

    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

TONY. How intend you- practis'd?

0
ESAR. You praise yourself
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I wrote to you
  ANTONY.

TONY. Sir,

0
ESAR. You have broken

0
PIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No;
  CAESAR.

OBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,

TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!

ESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  AGRIPPA.

RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,

0
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  AGRIPPA.

RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY.

TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd

TONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY.

TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea

RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA.

RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. I saw her once

ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Never! He will not.

TONY. If you can- your reason.

    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

    I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
    I wore his sword Philippan.

    I have myself resolv'd upon a course
    Which has no need of you; be gone.
    My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
    I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
    Have letters from me to some friends that will
    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
    Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
    Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;
    Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;
    Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]

    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,

    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
    His judgment too.

    The loyalty well held to fools does make

    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar

OBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still

    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,

    Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
    Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.
    Had our great palace the capacity
    To camp this host, we all would sup together,
    And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
    Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
    Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,
    That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
    Applauding our approach.                              Exeunt

    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,

    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
    His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
    Of what he has and has not.

0
TONY. All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS
    O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more!
    Fortune and Antony part here; even here
    Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
    That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
    Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
    On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
    That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
    O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
    Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
    Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-
    Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose
    Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.
    What, Eros, Eros!

0
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA
    'Tis well th'art gone,
    If it be well to live; but better 'twere
    Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
    Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
    The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
    Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
    And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
    Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.
    To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
    Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho!              Exit

TONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
    Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
    Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
    I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
    Unto an enemy's triumph.
    Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
    Ourselves to end ourselves.

0
TONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,

    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
    Off, pluck off!
    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
    The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
    Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
    No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
    You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.        Exit EROS
    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!

    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
    A nobleness in record. But I will be
    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,

    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, my dearest queen-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What's the matter?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. The gods best know-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, never was there queen
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Cleopatra-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Most sweet queen-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Hear me, queen:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. She's dead, my Queen.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O most false love!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My precious queen, forbear,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, by my sword-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I'll leave you, lady.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. But that your royalty
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Let us go. Come.
  ANTONY. 
0
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. I must not think there are
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Here's more news.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I should have known no less.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Antony,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Let his shames quickly
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Till which encounter
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Doubt not, sir;

  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Charmian!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Who's born that day
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. My salad days,

0
NECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I shall do well.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Caesar and Lepidus
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. From Silvius, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-
  VARRIUS. 
0
RRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
  POMPEY.

MPEY. I could have given less matter

PIDUS. 'Tis not a time
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Every time
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Your speech is passion;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Your speech is passion;
    But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
    The noble Antony.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Noble friends,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. 'Tis spoken well.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thank you.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Sit.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sit, sir.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I must be laugh'd at
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You praise yourself
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I wrote to you
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sir,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You have broken
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Neglected, rather;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. May I never

0
ESAR. There is my hand.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Happily, amen!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Time calls upon's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So is the fame.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. With most gladness;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Let us, Lepidus,

PIDUS. Noble Antony,
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Let us go.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt

ESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If you can- your reason.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Say to me,
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Caesar's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Speak this no more.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Get thee gone.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Get thee gone.
    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
                                                 Exit SOOTHSAYER
    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

L. The music, ho!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. 'Twas merry when
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That time? O times
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That time? O times
    I laughed him out of patience; and that night
    I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
    I wore his sword Philippan.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,

SSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well said.
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. But yet, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. For what good turn?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA.

SSENGER. Gracious madam,

EOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,

0
SSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
    These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
    A meaner than myself; since I myself
    Have given myself the cause.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. I have done my duty.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Is he married?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. He is married?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. Many times, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,

  POMPEY.

MPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;

ESAR. Most meet
  POMPEY.

MPEY. To you all three,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Take your time.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. At land, indeed,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There's the point.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And what may follow,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. You have made me offer
  ALL. 
0
L. That's our offer.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Know, then,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me have your hand.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Since I saw you last
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Well, I know not
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Well met here.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.

    Which has no need of you; be gone.
    My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
    I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
    Have letters from me to some friends that will
    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
    Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
    Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;

PHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
    Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
    His judgment too.

OBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
    The loyalty well held to fools does make
    Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure
    To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
    Does conquer him that did his master conquer,

TONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
    And to proclaim it civilly were like
    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
    For being yare about him.

0
OBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
    Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
    A diminution in our captain's brain
    Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,

    And leave his master Antony. For this pains
    Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest

    No honourable trust. I have done ill,

    If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean

    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder

    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;

    Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
    On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
    That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
    O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
    Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
    Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-
    Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose
    Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.

    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let

    And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
    Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.

    I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
    Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
    A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory

    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and

    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.

    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?

    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,

RCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

ESAR. O Antony,
    I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance
    Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
    Have shown to thee such a declining day
    Or look on thine; we could not stall together
    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
    That thou, my brother, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and companion in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
    Unreconciliable, should divide
    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-
  EGYPTIAN.

YPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,

    Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
    How hardly I was drawn into this war,
    How calm and gentle I proceeded still
    In all my writings. Go with me, and see
    What I can show in this.                              Exeunt

EOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;

OCULEIUS. You do extend

OCULEIUS. So, Dolabella,

EOPATRA. Say I would die.
  DOLABELLA.

LABELLA. Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. I cannot tell.
  DOLABELLA.

LABELLA. Assuredly you know me.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
  DOLABELLA. 
0
LABELLA. I understand not, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-
  DOLABELLA. 
0
LABELLA. If it might please ye-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck

LEUCUS. Madam,

EOPATRA. What have I kept back?
  SELEUCUS.

  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve

0
EOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, behold,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Good Queen, let us entreat you.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,

0
ESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS

    To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.
    Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
    And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
    To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.

    What poor an instrument
    May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
    My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing

    I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
    No planet is of mine.

    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR

ANTONY
CAESAR

  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR

  ENOBARBUS. 
2

RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once

  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

  POMPEY.

  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.

    There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
    What our contempts doth often hurl from us
    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
    By revolution low'ring, does become
    The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
    The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
    I must from this enchanting queen break off.
    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
    I did not send you. If you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
    That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS
  CHARMIAN.

CLEOPATRA

  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
  CHARMIAN.

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
ARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
    In time we hate that which we often fear.
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.

CLEOPATRA

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. O, never was there queen
  ANTONY.

CLEOPATRA

EOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. Hear me, queen:
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
  ANTONY.

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. She's dead, my Queen.
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. O most false love!

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!

CLEOPATRA

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.

CLEOPATRA

1
CAESAR
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
  CAESAR. 
2
CAESAR
MESSENGER
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.
  LEPIDUS.

EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,

CLEOPATRA

POMPEY
VARRIUS
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY

ANTONY

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY

ANTONY
CAESAR

  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS.

    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee

    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,

    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.

1

PIDUS. I must not think there are
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
  CAESAR. 
2
CAESAR
MESSENGER
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.
  LEPIDUS.

EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA.

  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN.

2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to

3
ANTONY

ENOBARBUS

3

  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

  ANTONY.

  POMPEY.

  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY

  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not

    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.

    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,

    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made

ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS.

ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

POMPEY
PIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-

POMPEY

POMPEY

POMPEY
MPEY. Well, I know not

POMPEY

  POMPEY.

  CAESAR. 
1
POMPEY
ESAR. That's the next to do.

1
POMPEY
TONY. You have heard much.
  POMPEY.

POMPEY
MPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
  ANTONY. 
1
POMPEY
TONY. And fair words to them.
  POMPEY. 
1
POMPEY
MPEY. Then so much have I heard;
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  POMPEY. 
1
POMPEY
MPEY. What, I pray you?
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

OBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage

1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems

1
POMPEY
NAS. Who would not have his wife so?
  ENOBARBUS.

    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
    But resolution and the briefest end.

    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

POMPEY
NAS. Pray ye, sir?

  MENAS.

    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them

    Have letters from me to some friends that will
    Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
    Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
    Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.

    In the whole world. But yet let me lament,

    That thou, my brother, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and companion in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
    Unreconciliable, should divide
    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-

  CHARMIAN.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
    I did not send you. If you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
    That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
ARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
    In time we hate that which we often fear.
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.

CLEOPATRA

EOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. What's the matter?

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. The gods best know-

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. O, never was there queen
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. Cleopatra-

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. Most sweet queen-

CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. Hear me, queen:
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
  ANTONY. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY

2
CLEOPATRA

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
TONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.

2
CLEOPATRA
ANTONY
EOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

1
CAESAR
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
  CAESAR. 
2
CAESAR
MESSENGER
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.
  LEPIDUS.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA

  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  ALEXAS. 
2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

POMPEY
VARRIUS
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. I must be laugh'd at
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Not so, not so;

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
3

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. No;

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  ANTONY.

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  LEPIDUS. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR

ANTONY

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR.

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
ESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. May I never

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  LEPIDUS. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
PIDUS. Happily, amen!

3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

ANTONY
CAESAR

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  ANTONY. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
3
ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS

  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Let us go.
  ENOBARBUS.

ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt

    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever

    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,

ANTONY
ILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.

    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,

EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA.

CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN.

CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
CLEOPATRA
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
1
CLEOPATRA
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

2
CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.
  ALEXAS.

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?

CLEOPATRA
ALEXAS

    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,

ANTONY
CAESAR
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to

ANTONY

3

2
ANTONY
CAESAR

2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR

  AGRIPPA. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR

ANTONY
CAESAR
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. I saw her once

  ENOBARBUS. 
2
ANTONY
CAESAR
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS.

    He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' th' East my pleasure lies.

  ANTONY.

  ENOBARBUS.

POMPEY
OBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
  MENAS.

  ENOBARBUS.

POMPEY

  ENOBARBUS.

POMPEY
OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
1
POMPEY
NAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
POMPEY
OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not

1
POMPEY
NAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage

POMPEY
OBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems

POMPEY

    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.

ARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
  ALEXAS.

EXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
  ALEXAS.

EXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.

AS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

AS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I

OTHSAYER. I have said.
  IRAS. 
0
AS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
  IRAS. 
0
AS. Not in my husband's nose.
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his

AS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as

OBARBUS. Madam?

EOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
  ALEXAS.

EXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

TONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!

ARMIAN. I did not see him since.
  CLEOPATRA.

  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.

ARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;

  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
  CAESAR.

ESAR. I should have known no less.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
  CAESAR.

PIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.

ARMIAN. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Who's born that day
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. My salad days,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I shall do well.
  MENAS.

NAS. Caesar and Lepidus
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. From Silvius, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
  VARRIUS.

RRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
  POMPEY.

MPEY. I could have given less matter
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. I cannot hope
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I know not, Menas,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I shall entreat him
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis not a time
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Every time
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Your speech is passion;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Noble friends,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. 'Tis spoken well.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thank you.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Sit.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sit, sir.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I must be laugh'd at
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You praise yourself
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I wrote to you
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sir,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You have broken
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Neglected, rather;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. May I never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There is my hand.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Happily, amen!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Time calls upon's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So is the fame.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. With most gladness;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Let us, Lepidus,

ECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.

0
OBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Let us go.
  ENOBARBUS.

  ANTONY.

TONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If you can- your reason.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Say to me,
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Caesar's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Speak this no more.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Get thee gone.

EOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food
  ALL.

L. The music, ho!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. 'Twas merry when

EOPATRA. That time? O times
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Madam, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well said.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. But yet, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. For what good turn?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Good madam, patience.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]

SSENGER. Gracious madam,

EOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,

SSENGER. He's married, madam.

EOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.

0
ARMIAN. Many times, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,

MPEY. At land, indeed,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There's the point.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
  CAESAR.

ESAR. And what may follow,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. You have made me offer
  ALL. 
0

TONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me have your hand.
  ANTONY.

  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Well, I know not
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Well met here.
  POMPEY.

MPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
  CAESAR.

ESAR. That's the next to do.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. That will I, Pompey.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You have heard much.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. And fair words to them.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Then so much have I heard;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What, I pray you?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
  POMPEY.

MPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Well;
  POMPEY.

OBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not

OBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems

0
NAS. Who would not have his wife so?

OBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He

NAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a

TONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it

PIDUS. What colour is it of?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Of it own colour too.

NAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

MPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What say'st thou?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. How should that be?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. But entertain it,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Hast thou drunk well?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  POMPEY.

  AGRIPPA.

SSENGER. She is not, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

SSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.

ESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily

OBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.

EOPATRA. Not know me yet?
  ANTONY.

TONY. Cold-hearted toward me?
  CLEOPATRA.

  ANTONY.

TONY. I am satisfied.
  CLEOPATRA.

ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir?
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. I must with haste from hence.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. I must be gone.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. She is cunning past man's thought.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Would I had never seen her!
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Fulvia is dead.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Sir?
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Fulvia is dead.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Fulvia?
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. Dead.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. The business she hath broached in the state
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
  ANTONY. 
1
ENOBARBUS
TONY. No more light answers. Let our officers
  ENOBARBUS.

ENOBARBUS
OBARBUS. I shall do't.                                Exeunt
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Where is he?
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. I did not see him since.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, my dearest queen-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What's the matter?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. The gods best know-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, never was there queen
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Cleopatra-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Most sweet queen-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Hear me, queen:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. She's dead, my Queen.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O most false love!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My precious queen, forbear,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, by my sword-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I'll leave you, lady.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. But that your royalty
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Let us go. Come.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. I must not think there are
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Here's more news.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I should have known no less.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Antony,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Let his shames quickly
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Till which encounter
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Doubt not, sir;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Charmian!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Who's born that day
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. My salad days,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I shall do well.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Caesar and Lepidus
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. From Silvius, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
  VARRIUS. 
0
RRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I could have given less matter
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. I cannot hope
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I know not, Menas,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I shall entreat him
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis not a time
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Every time
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Your speech is passion;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Noble friends,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. 'Tis spoken well.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thank you.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Sit.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sit, sir.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I must be laugh'd at
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You praise yourself
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I wrote to you
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sir,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You have broken
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Neglected, rather;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. May I never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There is my hand.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Happily, amen!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Time calls upon's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So is the fame.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. With most gladness;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Let us, Lepidus,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Noble Antony,
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Let us go.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. The world and my great office will sometimes
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. All which time
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Good night, sir.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If you can- your reason.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Say to me,
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Caesar's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Speak this no more.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Get thee gone.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We shall,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Your way is shorter;
  BOTH. 
0
TH. Sir, good success!
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food
  ALL. 
0
L. The music, ho!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. 'Twas merry when
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That time? O times
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well said.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. But yet, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. For what good turn?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Good madam, patience.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Gracious madam,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. I have done my duty.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Is he married?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. He is married?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Many times, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Most meet
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. To you all three,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Take your time.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. At land, indeed,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There's the point.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And what may follow,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. You have made me offer
  ALL. 
0
L. That's our offer.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Know, then,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me have your hand.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Since I saw you last
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Well, I know not
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Well met here.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. That's the next to do.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. That will I, Pompey.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You have heard much.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. And fair words to them.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Then so much have I heard;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What, I pray you?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Well;
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me shake thy hand.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0

NAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,

NAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
  MENAS.

NAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not

NAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage

0
OBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems

0
NAS. Who would not have his wife so?

OBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He

NAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a

PIDUS. What colour is it of?
  ANTONY.

MPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
  ANTONY.

TONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,
  MENAS.

NAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What say'st thou?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. How should that be?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. But entertain it,
  POMPEY.

MPEY. Hast thou drunk well?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  POMPEY.

OBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

OBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.

EOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. She is not, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

ARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!

EOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
  MESSENGER.

RIPPA. Who does he accuse?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
  AGRIPPA.

RIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
  MAECENAS.

OBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. What is't you say?

OBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
  ANTONY.

OBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
  ANTONY.

TONY. I'll fight at sea.

  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Think, and die.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. Prithee, peace.
  ANTONY.

EOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.
  THYREUS.

ANTONY
EOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,
    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
    As it rain'd kisses.
  ANTONY.

ANTONY

ANTONY
EOPATRA. O, is't come to this?
  ANTONY. 
1
ANTONY
TONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Wherefore is this?
  ANTONY. 
1
ANTONY
TONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
    And to proclaim it civilly were like
    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
    For being yare about him.
  SERVANT. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RVANT. Soundly, my lord.
  ANTONY.

  SERVANT. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RVANT. He did ask favour.
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
    As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS
  CLEOPATRA.

  CLEOPATRA. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
EOPATRA. I must stay his time.

ANTONY
TONY. Cold-hearted toward me?

EOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,

2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. I am satisfied.
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
EOPATRA. That's my brave lord!

  ANTONY.

SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
    I'll make death love me; for I will contend
    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
  ENOBARBUS.

SERVANT
ANTONY
OBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
  CAESAR.

ESAR. He calls me boy, and chides as he had power

OBARBUS. No.
  ANTONY.

ANTONY
TONY. Why should he not?
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,

TONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
  SCARUS.

  ANTONY.

  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. Swallows have built
  SCARUS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
ARUS. Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
    His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
    Of what he has and has not.

ANTONY
TONY. All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS

  ANTONY.

SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA

RDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O Charmian,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  ALEXAS. 
0
EXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Who's born that day
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. My salad days,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
  MENECRATES. 
0
NECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I shall do well.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Caesar and Lepidus
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. From Silvius, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
  VARRIUS. 
0
RRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I could have given less matter
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. I cannot hope
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I know not, Menas,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I shall entreat him
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis not a time
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Every time
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Your speech is passion;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Noble friends,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. 'Tis spoken well.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thank you.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Sit.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sit, sir.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I must be laugh'd at
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You praise yourself
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I wrote to you
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Sir,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You have broken
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Neglected, rather;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. May I never
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There is my hand.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Happily, amen!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Time calls upon's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So is the fame.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. With most gladness;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Let us, Lepidus,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Noble Antony,
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Let us go.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt
  ANTONY.

TONY. The world and my great office will sometimes

TONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,

0
TAVIA. Good night, sir.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If you can- your reason.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Say to me,
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. Caesar's.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Speak this no more.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Get thee gone.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. We shall,

TH. Sir, good success!
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food
  ALL. 
0
L. The music, ho!
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
  MARDIAN. 
0
RDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. 'Twas merry when
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That time? O times
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well said.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. But yet, madam-
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. For what good turn?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Good madam, patience.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Gracious madam,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. I have done my duty.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Is he married?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He's married, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. He is married?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Many times, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Most meet
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. To you all three,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Take your time.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. At land, indeed,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There's the point.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And what may follow,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. You have made me offer
  ALL. 
0
L. That's our offer.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Know, then,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me have your hand.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Since I saw you last
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Well, I know not
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Well met here.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. That's the next to do.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. That will I, Pompey.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You have heard much.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. And fair words to them.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Then so much have I heard;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What, I pray you?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Well;
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me shake thy hand.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Sir,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Enjoy thy plainness;
  ALL.

L. Show's the way, sir.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. At sea, I think.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. We have, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. You have done well by water.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Nor what I have done by water.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Who would not have his wife so?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Come, let's away.                                Exeunt

0
PIDUS. Y'have strange serpents there.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Ay, Lepidus.

0
TONY. They are so.
  POMPEY.

MPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till

NAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
  POMPEY.

MPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. What colour is it of?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Of it own colour too.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Will this description satisfy him?
  ANTONY.

TONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very

NAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

0
MPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What say'st thou?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. How should that be?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. But entertain it,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Hast thou drunk well?
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Show me which way.

OBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
  MENAS.

OBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.

RIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

SSENGER. She is not, madam.
  CLEOPATRA.

  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. That's not so good. He cannot like her long.

ARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!

EOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Round even to faultiness.

OS. There's strange news come, sir.
  ENOBARBUS.

0
OS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
  ENOBARBUS.

0
OS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
  EROS. 
0
OS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns

RIPPA. Who does he accuse?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
  MAECENAS.

ECENAS. He'll never yield to that.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  OCTAVIA.

TAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

0
EOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

0
OBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What is't you say?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. A good rebuke,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. By sea! What else?
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. For that he dares us to't.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. By sea, by sea.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I'll fight at sea.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,

NIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
  SOLDIER.

LDIER. They say one Taurus.
  CANIDIUS.

  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. Gods and goddesses,

0
OBARBUS. What's thy passion?
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. How appears the fight?
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,

    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar

SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
    As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS

2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
    I'll make death love me; for I will contend
    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS

    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand

TONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;

  ANTONY.

  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. Swallows have built
  SCARUS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
ARUS. Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
    His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
    Of what he has and has not.

ANTONY
TONY. All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS

ANTONY
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA

    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!

TONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  CAESAR.

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  CAESAR.

ESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
  ANTONY.

ESAR. You praise yourself

TONY. Not so, not so;
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  ANTONY.

TONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I wrote to you
  ANTONY.

TONY. Sir,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. You have broken
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Neglected, rather;
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY.

TONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  AGRIPPA.

RIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  ANTONY.

0
ESAR. There is my hand.

RIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS.

ECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I will tell you.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Royal wench!
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I saw her once
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  AGRIPPA.

RIPPA. Let us go.

0
OTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. If you can- your reason.
  SOOTHSAYER. 
0
OTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
  ANTONY.

TONY. Say to me,

OTHSAYER. Caesar's.
  ANTONY.

ARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
  MESSENGER.

EOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,

ESAR. Most meet
  POMPEY.

MPEY. To you all three,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Take your time.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. At land, indeed,
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. There's the point.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And what may follow,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. You have made me offer
  ALL. 
0

TONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Let me have your hand.
  ANTONY.

ESAR. Since I saw you last
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Well, I know not
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. Well met here.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. That's the next to do.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's

0
TONY. That will I, Pompey.
  POMPEY.

MPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. You have heard much.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. And fair words to them.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. Then so much have I heard;
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  POMPEY. 
0
MPEY. What, I pray you?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
  POMPEY.

MPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. Well;
  POMPEY.

OBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you

NAS. And you by land.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,

NAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  ENOBARBUS.

OBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  MENAS.

NAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray

OBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  MENAS.

NAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Pray ye, sir?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  MENAS. 
0
NAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

OBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not

OBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems

NAS. Who would not have his wife so?

PIDUS. What colour is it of?
  ANTONY.

NAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

MPEY. What say'st thou?
  MENAS.

NAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  POMPEY.

MPEY. How should that be?
  MENAS.

NAS. But entertain it,

EOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. She creeps.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. Is this certain?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Or I have no observance.
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. Three in Egypt
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. He's very knowing;
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Excellent.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Madam,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. And I do think she's thirty.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Round even to faultiness.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. There's gold for thee.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. A proper man.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Nothing, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. O my good lord,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Gentle Octavia,
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Thanks to my lord.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. When it appears to you where this begins,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. How now, friend Eros!
  EROS. 
0
OS. There's strange news come, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. What, man?
  EROS. 
0
OS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. This is old. What is the success?
  EROS. 
0
OS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
  EROS. 
0
OS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Our great navy's rigg'd.
  EROS. 
0
OS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. 'Twill be naught;
  EROS. 
0
OS. Come, sir.                                        Exeunt
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. This in the public eye?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Let Rome be thus
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Who does he accuse?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. He'll never yield to that.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Good my lord,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Which soon he granted,
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. I have eyes upon him,
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. My lord, in Athens.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Ay me most wretched,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Welcome hither.
  AGRIPPA. 
0
RIPPA. Welcome, lady.
  MAECENAS. 
0
ECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.
  OCTAVIA. 
0
TAVIA. Is it so, sir?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. But why, why,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What is't you say?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. A good rebuke,
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. By sea! What else?
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. For that he dares us to't.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. By sea, by sea.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I'll fight at sea.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Well, well- away.
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. You keep by land
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. While he was yet in Rome,
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. They say one Taurus.
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Well I know the man.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Taurus!
  TAURUS. 
0
URUS. My lord?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. Gods and goddesses,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. What's thy passion?
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. How appears the fight?
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. That I beheld;
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. She once being loof'd,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Alack, alack!
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts?
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
  SCARUS. 
0
ARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
  CANIDIUS. 
0
NIDIUS. To Caesar will I render
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. I'll yet follow
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
  ALL. 
0
L. Fly? Not we!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
  EROS. 
0
OS. Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.
  IRAS. 
0
AS. Do, most dear Queen.
  CHARMIAN. 
0
ARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, no, no, no, no.
  EROS. 
0
OS. See you here, sir?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
  CHARMIAN.

ARMIAN. Madam!
  IRAS.

AS. Madam, O good Empress!
  EROS. 
0
OS. Sir, sir!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Ah, stand by!
  EROS. 
0
OS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
  IRAS. 
0
AS. Go to him, madam, speak to him.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Well then, sustain me. O!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. I have offended reputation-
  EROS. 
0
OS. Sir, the Queen.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. O, my pardon!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Now I must

0
EOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!

TONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
  CAESAR.

ESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.
  DOLABELLA. 
0
LABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:

ESAR. Approach, and speak.
  EUPHRONIUS. 
0
PHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Be't so. Declare thine office.
  EUPHRONIUS. 
0
PHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. For Antony,
  EUPHRONIUS.

PHRONIUS. Fortune pursue thee!

  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Think, and die.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Prithee, peace.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Is that his answer?
  EUPHRONIUS. 
0
PHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.
  ANTONY.

TONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she

EOPATRA. Caesar's will?
  THYREUS. 
0
YREUS. Hear it apart.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.
  THYREUS. 
0
YREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
  ENOBARBUS. 
0
OBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
  THYREUS. 
0
YREUS. So.
  CLEOPATRA.

EOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!

EOPATRA. What's your name?
  THYREUS.

EOPATRA. Most kind messenger,
  THYREUS.

YREUS. 'Tis your noblest course.
  CLEOPATRA. 
0
EOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,
    When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
    As it rain'd kisses.
  ANTONY.

ANTONY

ANTONY

TONY. You have been a boggler ever.
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
ANTONY
EOPATRA. O, is't come to this?
  ANTONY. 
1
ANTONY
TONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Wherefore is this?
  ANTONY. 
1
ANTONY
TONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
    My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
    And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
    The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
    And to proclaim it civilly were like
    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
    For being yare about him.
  SERVANT. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RVANT. Soundly, my lord.
  ANTONY.

SERVANT

  SERVANT. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RVANT. He did ask favour.
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
    He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
    As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
    Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS
  CLEOPATRA.

ANTONY
TONY. Cold-hearted toward me?

EOPATRA. That's my brave lord!

ANTONY
TONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
    I'll make death love me; for I will contend
    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS

  FIRST

SERVANT

RST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
  SOLDIERS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
LDIERS. Content. 'Tis strange.                        Exeunt
  ANTONY.

TONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!
  CLEOPATRA.

ANTONY
TONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
    Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
                      Exeunt ANTONY, EROS, CAPTAINS and soldiers

  CLEOPATRA.

SERVANT
EOPATRA. Lead me.
  SOLDIER. 
1
SERVANT
LDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
  SOLDIER. 
1
SERVANT
LDIER. Hadst thou done so,
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Who's gone this morning?
  SOLDIER. 
1
SERVANT
LDIER. Who?
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. What say'st thou?
  SOLDIER. 
1

1
SERVANT

  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Is he gone?
  SOLDIER. 
1
SERVANT
LDIER. Most certain.
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
  AGRIPPA. 
1
SERVANT
RIPPA. Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit

ESAR. Go charge Agrippa
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. Go charge Agrippa
    Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
    That Antony may seem to spend his fury
    Upon himself.                       Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
SERVANT
OBARBUS. Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
  SOLDIER. 
1
SERVANT
LDIER. Enobarbus, Antony
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
SERVANT
OBARBUS. I give it you.
  SOLDIER. 
1
SERVANT
LDIER. Mock not, Enobarbus.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
SERVANT
OBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth,
  AGRIPPA. 
1
SERVANT
RIPPA. Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T,
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. They do retire.
  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
  EROS. 
1
SERVANT
OS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. Let us score their backs
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. I will reward thee
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
SERVANT
EOPATRA. Lord of lords!
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Mine nightingale,
  CLEOPATRA. 
1
SERVANT
EOPATRA. I'll give thee, friend,
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
  CENTURION. 
1
SERVANT
NTURION. If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
  FIRST 
1
SERVANT
RST WATCH. This last day was
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
SERVANT
OBARBUS. O, bear me witness, night-
  SECOND 
1
SERVANT
COND WATCH. What man is this?
  FIRST 
1
SERVANT
RST WATCH. Stand close and list him.
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
SERVANT
OBARBUS. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
  CENTURION. 
1
SERVANT
NTURION. Enobarbus?
  SECOND 
1
SERVANT
COND WATCH. Peace!
  ENOBARBUS. 
1
SERVANT
OBARBUS. O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
  FIRST 
1
SERVANT
RST WATCH. Let's speak to him.
  CENTURION. 
1
SERVANT
NTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
  SECOND 
1
SERVANT
COND WATCH. Let's do so. But he sleeps.
  CENTURION. 
1
SERVANT
NTURION. Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
  FIRST 
1
SERVANT
RST WATCH. Go we to him.
  SECOND 
1
SERVANT
COND WATCH. Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
  FIRST 
1
SERVANT
RST WATCH. Hear you, sir?
  CENTURION. 
1
SERVANT
NTURION. The hand of death hath raught him.
  SECOND 
1
SERVANT
COND WATCH. Come on, then;
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. For both, my lord.
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. But being charg'd, we will be still by land,
  ANTONY. 
1
SERVANT
TONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
  SCARUS. 
1
SERVANT
ARUS. Swallows have built
  SCARUS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
ARUS. Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
    His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
    Of what he has and has not.
                            [Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight]
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. All is lost!
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA
  CLEOPATRA. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
EOPATRA. Help me, my women. O, he is more mad

SERVANT
ANTONY
EOPATRA. To th' monument!

ANTONY
TONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
  EROS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
OS. Ay, noble lord.
  ANTONY.

SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
  EROS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
OS. Ay, my lord.
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
  EROS. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
OS. It does, my lord.
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
  MARDIAN. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RDIAN. No, Antony;
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
  MARDIAN. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once,
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Dead then?
  MARDIAN. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
RDIAN. Dead.
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
  ANTONY. 
2
SERVANT
ANTONY
TONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
    Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
    Off, pluck off!
    The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
    The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
    Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
    Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
    No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
    You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.        Exit EROS
  ANTONY.

    No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
    You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.        Exit EROS
    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
  EROS. 
3
SERVANT
ANTONY
EROS
OS. What would my lord?
  ANTONY. 
3
SERVANT
ANTONY

EROS
OS. The gods withhold me!
  ANTONY.

TONY. Eros,

ANTONY
EROS

  EROS.

SERVANT
ANTONY
EROS
