PHILO
0
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
CLEOPATRA
0
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
ANTONY
0
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
CLEOPATRA
0
I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
ANTONY
0
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
MESSENGER
0
News, my good lord, from Rome.
ANTONY
0
Grates me the sum.
CLEOPATRA
0
Nay, hear them, Antony.
ANTONY
0
How, my love?
CLEOPATRA
0
Perchance? Nay, and most like,
ANTONY
0
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
CLEOPATRA
0
Excellent falsehood!
ANTONY
0
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
CLEOPATRA
0
Hear the ambassadors.
ANTONY
0
Fie, wrangling queen!
DEMETRIUS
0
Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
PHILO
0
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
DEMETRIUS
0
I am full sorry
CHARMIAN
0
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
ALEXAS
0
Soothsayer!
SOOTHSAYER
0
Your will?
CHARMIAN
0
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
SOOTHSAYER
0
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
ALEXAS
0
Show him your hand.
ENOBARBUS
0
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
CHARMIAN
0
Good, sir, give me good fortune.
SOOTHSAYER
0
I make not, but foresee.
CHARMIAN
0
Pray, then, foresee me one.
SOOTHSAYER
0
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
CHARMIAN
0
He means in flesh.
IRAS
0
No, you shall paint when you are old.
CHARMIAN
0
Wrinkles forbid!
ALEXAS
0
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
CHARMIAN
0
Hush!
SOOTHSAYER
0
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
CHARMIAN
0
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
ALEXAS
0
Nay, hear him.
CHARMIAN
0
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
SOOTHSAYER
0
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
CHARMIAN
0
O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
SOOTHSAYER
0
You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
CHARMIAN
0
Then belike my children shall have no names.
SOOTHSAYER
0
If every of your wishes had a womb,
CHARMIAN
0
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
ALEXAS
0
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
CHARMIAN
0
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
ALEXAS
0
We'll know all our fortunes.
ENOBARBUS
0
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-
IRAS
0
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
CHARMIAN
0
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
IRAS
0
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
CHARMIAN
0
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
SOOTHSAYER
0
Your fortunes are alike.
IRAS
0
But how, but how? Give me particulars.
SOOTHSAYER
0
I have said.
IRAS
0
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
CHARMIAN
0
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
IRAS
0
Not in my husband's nose.
CHARMIAN
0
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
IRAS
0
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
CHARMIAN
0
Amen.
ALEXAS
0
Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
ENOBARBUS
0
Hush! Here comes Antony.
CHARMIAN
0
Not he; the Queen.
CLEOPATRA
0
Saw you my lord?
ENOBARBUS
0
No, lady.
CLEOPATRA
0
Was he not here?
CHARMIAN
0
No, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
ENOBARBUS
0
Madam?
CLEOPATRA
0
Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
ALEXAS
0
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
CLEOPATRA
0
We will not look upon him. Go with us.
MESSENGER
0
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
ANTONY
0
Against my brother Lucius?
MESSENGER
0
Ay.
ANTONY
0
Well, what worst?
MESSENGER
0
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
ANTONY
0
When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
MESSENGER
0
Labienus-
ANTONY
0
Antony, thou wouldst say.
MESSENGER
0
O, my lord!
ANTONY
0
Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
MESSENGER
0
At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
ANTONY
0
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
FIRST ATTENDANT
0
The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
SECOND ATTENDANT
0
He stays upon your will.
ANTONY
0
Let him appear.
SECOND MESSENGER
0
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
ANTONY
0
Where died she?
SECOND MESSENGER
0
In Sicyon.
ANTONY
0
Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
    There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
    What our contempts doth often hurl from us
    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
    By revolution low'ring, does become
    The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
    The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
    I must from this enchanting queen break off.
    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
What's your pleasure, sir?
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
I must with haste from hence.
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
I must be gone.
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
She is cunning past man's thought.
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Would I had never seen her!
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Fulvia is dead.
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Sir?
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Fulvia is dead.
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Fulvia?
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
Dead.
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
The business she hath broached in the state
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
ANTONY
1
ENOBARBUS
No more light answers. Let our officers
ENOBARBUS
1
ENOBARBUS
I shall do't.                                Exeunt
CLEOPATRA
0
Where is he?
CHARMIAN
0
I did not see him since.
CLEOPATRA
0
See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
CHARMIAN
0
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
CLEOPATRA
0
What should I do I do not?
CHARMIAN
0
In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
CLEOPATRA
0
Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
CHARMIAN
0
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
CLEOPATRA
0
I am sick and sullen.
ANTONY
0
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
CLEOPATRA
0
Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
ANTONY
0
Now, my dearest queen-
CLEOPATRA
0
Pray you, stand farther from me.
ANTONY
0
What's the matter?
CLEOPATRA
0
I know by that same eye there's some good news.
ANTONY
0
The gods best know-
CLEOPATRA
0
O, never was there queen
ANTONY
0
Cleopatra-
CLEOPATRA
0
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
ANTONY
0
Most sweet queen-
CLEOPATRA
0
Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
ANTONY
0
How now, lady!
CLEOPATRA
0
I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
ANTONY
0
Hear me, queen:
CLEOPATRA
0
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
ANTONY
0
She's dead, my Queen.
CLEOPATRA
0
O most false love!
ANTONY
0
Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
CLEOPATRA
0
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
ANTONY
0
My precious queen, forbear,
CLEOPATRA
0
So Fulvia told me.
ANTONY
0
You'll heat my blood; no more.
CLEOPATRA
0
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
ANTONY
0
Now, by my sword-
CLEOPATRA
0
And target. Still he mends;
ANTONY
0
I'll leave you, lady.
CLEOPATRA
0
Courteous lord, one word.
ANTONY
0
But that your royalty
CLEOPATRA
0
'Tis sweating labour
ANTONY
0
Let us go. Come.
CAESAR
0
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
LEPIDUS
0
I must not think there are
CAESAR
0
You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
LEPIDUS
0
Here's more news.
MESSENGER
0
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
CAESAR
0
I should have known no less.
MESSENGER
0
Caesar, I bring thee word
CAESAR
0
Antony,
LEPIDUS
0
'Tis pity of him.
CAESAR
0
Let his shames quickly
LEPIDUS
0
To-morrow, Caesar,
CAESAR
0
Till which encounter
LEPIDUS
0
Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
CAESAR
0
Doubt not, sir;
CLEOPATRA
0
Charmian!
CHARMIAN
0
Madam?
CLEOPATRA
0
Ha, ha!
CHARMIAN
0
Why, madam?
CLEOPATRA
0
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
CHARMIAN
0
You think of him too much.
CLEOPATRA
0
O, 'tis treason!
CHARMIAN
0
Madam, I trust, not so.
CLEOPATRA
0
Thou, eunuch Mardian!
MARDIAN
0
What's your Highness' pleasure?
CLEOPATRA
0
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
MARDIAN
0
Yes, gracious madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
Indeed?
MARDIAN
0
Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
CLEOPATRA
0
O Charmian,
ALEXAS
0
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
CLEOPATRA
0
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
ALEXAS
0
Last thing he did, dear Queen,
CLEOPATRA
0
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
ALEXAS
0
'Good friend,' quoth he
CLEOPATRA
0
What, was he sad or merry?
ALEXAS
0
Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
CLEOPATRA
0
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
ALEXAS
0
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
CLEOPATRA
0
Who's born that day
CHARMIAN
0
O that brave Caesar!
CLEOPATRA
0
Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
CHARMIAN
0
The valiant Caesar!
CLEOPATRA
0
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
CHARMIAN
0
By your most gracious pardon,
CLEOPATRA
0
My salad days,
POMPEY
0
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
MENECRATES
0
Know, worthy Pompey,
POMPEY
0
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
MENECRATES
0
We, ignorant of ourselves,
POMPEY
0
I shall do well.
MENAS
0
Caesar and Lepidus
POMPEY
0
Where have you this? 'Tis false.
MENAS
0
From Silvius, sir.
POMPEY
0
He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
VARRIUS
0
This is most certain that I shall deliver:
POMPEY
0
I could have given less matter
MENAS
0
I cannot hope
POMPEY
0
I know not, Menas,
LEPIDUS
0
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
ENOBARBUS
0
I shall entreat him
LEPIDUS
0
'Tis not a time
ENOBARBUS
0
Every time
LEPIDUS
0
But small to greater matters must give way.
ENOBARBUS
0
Not if the small come first.
LEPIDUS
0
Your speech is passion;
ENOBARBUS
0
And yonder, Caesar.
ANTONY
0
If we compose well here, to Parthia.
CAESAR
0
I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
LEPIDUS
0
Noble friends,
ANTONY
0
'Tis spoken well.
CAESAR
0
Welcome to Rome.
ANTONY
0
Thank you.
CAESAR
0
Sit.
ANTONY
0
Sit, sir.
CAESAR
0
Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
ANTONY
0
I learn you take things ill which are not so,
CAESAR
0
I must be laugh'd at
ANTONY
0
My being in Egypt, Caesar,
CAESAR
0
No more than my residing here at Rome
ANTONY
0
How intend you- practis'd?
CAESAR
0
You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
ANTONY
0
You do mistake your business; my brother never
CAESAR
0
You praise yourself
ANTONY
0
Not so, not so;
ENOBARBUS
0
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
ANTONY
0
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
CAESAR
0
I wrote to you
ANTONY
0
Sir,
CAESAR
0
You have broken
LEPIDUS
0
Soft, Caesar!
ANTONY
0
No;
CAESAR
0
To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
ANTONY
0
Neglected, rather;
LEPIDUS
0
'Tis noble spoken.
MAECENAS
0
If it might please you to enforce no further
LEPIDUS
0
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
ENOBARBUS
0
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
ANTONY
0
Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
ENOBARBUS
0
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
ANTONY
0
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
ENOBARBUS
0
Go to, then- your considerate stone!
CAESAR
0
I do not much dislike the matter, but
AGRIPPA
0
Give me leave, Caesar.
CAESAR
0
Speak, Agrippa.
AGRIPPA
0
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
CAESAR
0
Say not so, Agrippa.
ANTONY
0
I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
AGRIPPA
0
To hold you in perpetual amity,
ANTONY
0
Will Caesar speak?
CAESAR
0
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
ANTONY
0
What power is in Agrippa,
CAESAR
0
The power of Caesar, and
ANTONY
0
May I never
CAESAR
0
There is my hand.
LEPIDUS
0
Happily, amen!
ANTONY
0
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
LEPIDUS
0
Time calls upon's.
ANTONY
0
Where lies he?
CAESAR
0
About the Mount Misenum.
ANTONY
0
What is his strength by land?
CAESAR
0
Great and increasing; but by sea
ANTONY
0
So is the fame.
CAESAR
0
With most gladness;
ANTONY
0
Let us, Lepidus,
LEPIDUS
0
Noble Antony,
MAECENAS
0
Welcome from Egypt, sir.
ENOBARBUS
0
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
AGRIPPA
0
Good Enobarbus!
MAECENAS
0
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
ENOBARBUS
0
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
MAECENAS
0
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
ENOBARBUS
0
This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
MAECENAS
0
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
ENOBARBUS
0
When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
AGRIPPA
0
There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
ENOBARBUS
0
I will tell you.
AGRIPPA
0
O, rare for Antony!
ENOBARBUS
0
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
AGRIPPA
0
Rare Egyptian!
ENOBARBUS
0
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
AGRIPPA
0
Royal wench!
ENOBARBUS
0
I saw her once
MAECENAS
0
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
ENOBARBUS
0
Never! He will not.
MAECENAS
0
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
AGRIPPA
0
Let us go.
ENOBARBUS
0
Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt
ANTONY
0
The world and my great office will sometimes
OCTAVIA
0
All which time
ANTONY
0
Good night, sir. My Octavia,
OCTAVIA
0
Good night, sir.
CAESAR
0
Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
ANTONY
0
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
SOOTHSAYER
0
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
ANTONY
0
If you can- your reason.
SOOTHSAYER
0
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
ANTONY
0
Say to me,
SOOTHSAYER
0
Caesar's.
ANTONY
0
Speak this no more.
SOOTHSAYER
0
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
ANTONY
0
Get thee gone.
LEPIDUS
0
Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
AGRIPPA
0
Sir, Mark Antony
LEPIDUS
0
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
MAECENAS
0
We shall,
LEPIDUS
0
Your way is shorter;
BOTH
0
Sir, good success!
LEPIDUS
0
Farewell.                                      Exeunt
CLEOPATRA
0
Give me some music- music, moody food
ALL
0
The music, ho!
CLEOPATRA
0
Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
CHARMIAN
0
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
CLEOPATRA
0
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
MARDIAN
0
As well as I can, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
CHARMIAN
0
'Twas merry when
CLEOPATRA
0
That time? O times
MESSENGER
0
Madam, madam-
CLEOPATRA
0
Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
MESSENGER
0
First, madam, he is well.
CLEOPATRA
0
Why, there's more gold.
MESSENGER
0
Good madam, hear me.
CLEOPATRA
0
Well, go to, I will.
MESSENGER
0
Will't please you hear me?
CLEOPATRA
0
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
MESSENGER
0
Madam, he's well.
CLEOPATRA
0
Well said.
MESSENGER
0
And friends with Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
0
Th'art an honest man.
MESSENGER
0
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
CLEOPATRA
0
Make thee a fortune from me.
MESSENGER
0
But yet, madam-
CLEOPATRA
0
I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
MESSENGER
0
Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
CLEOPATRA
0
For what good turn?
MESSENGER
0
For the best turn i' th' bed.
CLEOPATRA
0
I am pale, Charmian.
MESSENGER
0
Madam, he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA
0
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
MESSENGER
0
Good madam, patience.
CLEOPATRA
0
What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
MESSENGER
0
Gracious madam,
CLEOPATRA
0
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
MESSENGER
0
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
MESSENGER
0
Nay, then I'll run.
CHARMIAN
0
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
CLEOPATRA
0
Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
CHARMIAN
0
He is afear'd to come.
CLEOPATRA
0
I will not hurt him.
MESSENGER
0
I have done my duty.
CLEOPATRA
0
Is he married?
MESSENGER
0
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
MESSENGER
0
Should I lie, madam?
CLEOPATRA
0
O, I would thou didst,
MESSENGER
0
I crave your Highness' pardon.
CLEOPATRA
0
He is married?
MESSENGER
0
Take no offence that I would not offend you;
CLEOPATRA
0
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
CHARMIAN
0
Good your Highness, patience.
CLEOPATRA
0
In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
CHARMIAN
0
Many times, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
POMPEY
0
Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
CAESAR
0
Most meet
POMPEY
0
To you all three,
CAESAR
0
Take your time.
ANTONY
0
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
POMPEY
0
At land, indeed,
LEPIDUS
0
Be pleas'd to tell us-
CAESAR
0
There's the point.
ANTONY
0
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
CAESAR
0
And what may follow,
POMPEY
0
You have made me offer
ALL
0
That's our offer.
POMPEY
0
Know, then,
ANTONY
0
I have heard it, Pompey,
POMPEY
0
Let me have your hand.
ANTONY
0
The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
CAESAR
0
Since I saw you last
POMPEY
0
Well, I know not
LEPIDUS
0
Well met here.
POMPEY
0
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
CAESAR
0
That's the next to do.
POMPEY
0
We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
ANTONY
0
That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY
0
No, Antony, take the lot;
ANTONY
0
You have heard much.
POMPEY
0
I have fair meanings, sir.
ANTONY
0
And fair words to them.
POMPEY
0
Then so much have I heard;
ENOBARBUS
0
No more of that! He did so.
POMPEY
0
What, I pray you?
ENOBARBUS
0
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY
0
I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
ENOBARBUS
0
Well;
POMPEY
0
Let me shake thy hand.
ENOBARBUS
0
Sir,
POMPEY
0
Enjoy thy plainness;
ALL
0
Show's the way, sir.
POMPEY
0
Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS

[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
ENOBARBUS

At sea, I think.
MENAS
0
We have, sir.
ENOBARBUS
0
You have done well by water.
MENAS
0
And you by land.
ENOBARBUS
0
I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it
MENAS
0
Nor what I have done by water.
ENOBARBUS
0
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
MENAS
0
And you by land.
ENOBARBUS
0
There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
MENAS
0
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
ENOBARBUS
0
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS
0
No slander: they steal hearts.
ENOBARBUS
0
We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS
0
For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
ENOBARBUS
0
If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
MENAS
0
Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
ENOBARBUS
0
Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
MENAS
0
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
ENOBARBUS
0
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS
0
Pray ye, sir?
ENOBARBUS
0
'Tis true.
MENAS
0
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
ENOBARBUS
0
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
MENAS
0
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
ENOBARBUS
0
I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems

Who would not have his wife so?
ENOBARBUS
0
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He

And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a

I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.

Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
MENAS

[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
POMPEY
0
[ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
LEPIDUS
0
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
ANTONY
0
It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
LEPIDUS
0
What colour is it of?
ANTONY
0
Of it own colour too.
LEPIDUS
0
'Tis a strange serpent.
ANTONY
0
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
CAESAR
0
Will this description satisfy him?
ANTONY

With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very

[Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks
MENAS
0
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
POMPEY
0
Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
ANTONY
0
These quicksands, Lepidus,
MENAS
0
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
POMPEY
0
What say'st thou?
MENAS
0
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
POMPEY
0
How should that be?
MENAS
0
But entertain it,
POMPEY
0
Hast thou drunk well?
MENAS
0
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
POMPEY
0
Show me which way.
MENAS
0
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
POMPEY
0
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
MENAS
0
[Aside] For this,
POMPEY
0
This health to Lepidus!
ANTONY
0
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
ENOBARBUS
0
Here's to thee, Menas!
MENAS
0
Enobarbus, welcome!
POMPEY
0
Fill till the cup be hid.
ENOBARBUS
0
There's a strong fellow, Menas.
MENAS
0
Why?
ENOBARBUS
0
'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
MENAS
0
The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
ENOBARBUS
0
Drink thou; increase the reels.
MENAS
0
Come.
POMPEY
0
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
ANTONY
0
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
CAESAR

I could well forbear't.
ANTONY

Be a child o' th' time.
CAESAR
0
Possess it, I'll make answer.
ENOBARBUS

[To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
POMPEY

Let's ha't, good soldier.
ANTONY

Come, let's all take hands,
ENOBARBUS

All take hands.
CAESAR

What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
POMPEY

I'll try you on the shore.
ANTONY

And shall, sir. Give's your hand.

O Antony,

Take heed you fall not.

What, are the brothers parted?
ENOBARBUS

They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
AGRIPPA

'Tis a noble Lepidus.
ENOBARBUS
0
A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!
AGRIPPA
0
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
ENOBARBUS
0
Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
AGRIPPA
0
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
ENOBARBUS
0
Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
AGRIPPA
0
O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
ENOBARBUS
0
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
AGRIPPA
0
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
ENOBARBUS
0
But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.
AGRIPPA

Both he loves.

They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets

You shall not find,

I'll tell you in your ear.

Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can

Most gracious Majesty!
CLEOPATRA

Didst thou behold Octavia?
MESSENGER
0
Ay, dread Queen.
CLEOPATRA
0
Where?
MESSENGER
0
Madam, in Rome
CLEOPATRA
0
Is she as tall as me?
MESSENGER
0
She is not, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
MESSENGER
0
Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
CLEOPATRA
0
That's not so good. He cannot like her long.
CHARMIAN
0
Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
CLEOPATRA
0
I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
MESSENGER
0
She creeps.
CLEOPATRA
0
Is this certain?
MESSENGER
0
Or I have no observance.
CHARMIAN

CLEOPATRA

He's very knowing;

Excellent.
CLEOPATRA

Guess at her years, I prithee.

Madam,
CLEOPATRA
0
Widow? Charmian, hark!
MESSENGER
0
And I do think she's thirty.
CLEOPATRA
0
Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
MESSENGER
0
Round even to faultiness.
CLEOPATRA
0
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
MESSENGER
0
Brown, madam; and her forehead
CLEOPATRA
0
There's gold for thee.
CHARMIAN
0
A proper man.
CLEOPATRA
0
Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
CHARMIAN
0
Nothing, madam.
CLEOPATRA
0
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
CHARMIAN
0
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
CLEOPATRA

I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
CHARMIAN
0
I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt
ANTONY
0
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
OCTAVIA

O my good lord,
ANTONY
0
Gentle Octavia,
OCTAVIA
0
Thanks to my lord.
ANTONY
0
When it appears to you where this begins,
ENOBARBUS
0
How now, friend Eros!
EROS
0
There's strange news come, sir.
ENOBARBUS
0
What, man?
EROS
0
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
ENOBARBUS
0
This is old. What is the success?
EROS
0
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
ENOBARBUS
0
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
EROS
0
He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
ENOBARBUS
0
Our great navy's rigg'd.
EROS
0
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
ENOBARBUS
0
'Twill be naught;
EROS
0
Come, sir.                                        Exeunt
CAESAR
0
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
MAECENAS
0
This in the public eye?
CAESAR
0
I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
MAECENAS
0
Let Rome be thus
AGRIPPA
0
Who, queasy with his insolence
CAESAR
0
The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
AGRIPPA
0
Who does he accuse?
CAESAR
0
Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
AGRIPPA
0
Sir, this should be answer'd.
CAESAR
0
'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
MAECENAS
0
He'll never yield to that.
CAESAR
0
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
OCTAVIA
0
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
CAESAR
0
That ever I should call thee cast-away!
OCTAVIA
0
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
CAESAR
0
Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
OCTAVIA
0
Good my lord,
CAESAR
0
Which soon he granted,
OCTAVIA
0
Do not say so, my lord.
CAESAR
0
I have eyes upon him,
OCTAVIA
0
My lord, in Athens.
CAESAR
0
No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
OCTAVIA
0
Ay me most wretched,
CAESAR
0
Welcome hither.
AGRIPPA
0
Welcome, lady.
MAECENAS
0
Welcome, dear madam.
OCTAVIA
0
Is it so, sir?
CAESAR
0
Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
CLEOPATRA
0
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
ENOBARBUS
0
But why, why,
CLEOPATRA
0
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
ENOBARBUS
0
Well, is it, is it?
CLEOPATRA
0
Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
ENOBARBUS
0
[Aside] Well, I could reply:
CLEOPATRA
0
What is't you say?
ENOBARBUS
0
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
CLEOPATRA
0
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
ENOBARBUS
0
Nay, I have done.
ANTONY
0
Is it not strange, Canidius,
CLEOPATRA
0
Celerity is never more admir'd
ANTONY
0
A good rebuke,
CLEOPATRA
0
By sea! What else?
CANIDIUS
0
Why will my lord do so?
ANTONY
0
For that he dares us to't.
ENOBARBUS
0
So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
CANIDIUS
0
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
ENOBARBUS
0
Your ships are not well mann'd;
ANTONY
0
By sea, by sea.
ENOBARBUS
0
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
ANTONY
0
I'll fight at sea.
CLEOPATRA
0
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
ANTONY
0
Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
MESSENGER
0
The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
ANTONY
0
Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
SOLDIER
0
O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
ANTONY
0
Well, well- away.
SOLDIER
0
By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
CANIDIUS
0
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
SOLDIER
0
You keep by land
CANIDIUS

Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
SOLDIER
0
While he was yet in Rome,
CANIDIUS
0
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
SOLDIER
0
They say one Taurus.
CANIDIUS
0
Well I know the man.
MESSENGER
0
The Emperor calls Canidius.
CANIDIUS
0
With news the time's with labour and throes forth
CAESAR
0
Taurus!
TAURUS
0
My lord?
CAESAR
0
Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle
ANTONY
0
Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
ENOBARBUS
0
Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
SCARUS
0
Gods and goddesses,
ENOBARBUS
0
What's thy passion?
SCARUS
0
The greater cantle of the world is lost
ENOBARBUS
0
How appears the fight?
SCARUS
0
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
ENOBARBUS
0
That I beheld;
SCARUS
0
She once being loof'd,
ENOBARBUS
0
Alack, alack!
CANIDIUS
0
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
ENOBARBUS
0
Ay, are you thereabouts?
CANIDIUS
0
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
SCARUS
0
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
CANIDIUS
0
To Caesar will I render
ENOBARBUS
0
I'll yet follow
ANTONY
0
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
ALL
0
Fly? Not we!
ANTONY
0
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
EROS
0
Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.
IRAS
0
Do, most dear Queen.
CHARMIAN
0
Do? Why, what else?
CLEOPATRA
0
Let me sit down. O Juno!
ANTONY
0
No, no, no, no, no.
EROS

See you here, sir?
ANTONY

O, fie, fie, fie!
CHARMIAN

Madam, O good Empress!
EROS

Sir, sir!

Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
CLEOPATRA

Ah, stand by!
EROS

The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
IRAS
0
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
CLEOPATRA
0
Well then, sustain me. O!
ANTONY
0
I have offended reputation-
EROS
0
Sir, the Queen.
ANTONY
0
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
CLEOPATRA

O my lord, my lord,
ANTONY

Egypt, thou knew'st too well
CLEOPATRA

O, my pardon!
ANTONY
0
Now I must

Pardon, pardon!

Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates

Caesar, I shall.                               Exeunt
CLEOPATRA
0
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
ENOBARBUS
0
Think, and die.
CLEOPATRA
0
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
ENOBARBUS
0
Antony only, that would make his will
CLEOPATRA

Prithee, peace.
ANTONY
0
Is that his answer?
EUPHRONIUS
0
Ay, my lord.

The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she

Caesar's will?

Hear it apart.
CLEOPATRA

None but friends: say boldly.
THYREUS
0
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
ENOBARBUS
0
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
THYREUS
0
So.

Go on. Right royal!

To let a fellow that will take rewards,

    Upon the hill of Basan to outroar

SERVANT
If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
    The white hand of a lady fever thee!
    Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
    Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
    Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has

Alack, our terrene moon
CLEOPATRA

I must stay his time.
ANTONY

To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes

Cold-hearted toward me?

Ah, dear, if I be so,

I am satisfied.

That's my brave lord!

I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,

We will yet do well.

Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
ANTONY

Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
    I'll make death love me; for I will contend
    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
ENOBARBUS
1

Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
CAESAR

He calls me boy, and chides as he had power

No.

Why should he not?
ENOBARBUS
1
SERVANT
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
ANTONY

SERVANT
To-morrow, soldier,
ENOBARBUS

I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
ANTONY

Well said; come on.

'Tis well blown, lads.
    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
    So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
    This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
    And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
    Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

Most certain.

Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;

Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.

Let's speak to him.

For both, my lord.

I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;

But being charg'd, we will be still by land,

Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand

Swallows have built
SCARUS

SERVANT
ANTONY
Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
    Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
    His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
    Of what he has and has not.

All is lost!
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS

Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
ANTONY

Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA

Dead then?

Dead.

    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
    Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
