WARWICK
0
I wonder how the King escap'd our hands.
YORK
0
While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north,
EDWARD
0
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
MONTAGUE
0
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
RICHARD
0
Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.
YORK
0
Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.
NORFOLK
0
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
RICHARD
0
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
WARWICK
0
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
YORK
0
Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
NORFOLK
0
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
YORK
0
Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;
WARWICK
0
And when the King comes, offer him no violence.
YORK
0
The Queen this day here holds her parliament,
RICHARD
0
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
WARWICK
0
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
YORK
0
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:
WARWICK
0
Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
KING HENRY
0
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
CLIFFORD
0
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
WESTMORELAND
0
What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
KING HENRY
0
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
CLIFFORD
0
Patience is for poltroons such as he;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
KING HENRY
0
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
EXETER
0
But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
KING HENRY
0
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
YORK
0
I am thine.
EXETER
0
For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
YORK
0
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
EXETER
0
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
WARWICK
0
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
CLIFFORD
0
Whom should he follow but his natural king?
WARWICK
0
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
KING HENRY
0
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
YORK
0
It must and shall be so; content thyself.
WARWICK
0
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
WESTMORELAND
0
He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
WARWICK
0
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
WESTMORELAND
0
Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
CLIFFORD
0
Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
WARWICK
0
Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
YORK
0
Will you we show our title to the crown?
KING HENRY
0
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
WARWICK
0
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
KING HENRY
0
The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
RICHARD
0
You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
EDWARD
0
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
MONTAGUE
0
Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
RICHARD
0
Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
YORK
0
Sons, peace!
KING HENRY
0
Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
WARWICK
0
Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
KING HENRY
0
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
WARWICK
0
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
KING HENRY
0
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
YORK
0
'Twas by rebellion against his king.
KING HENRY
0
[Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
YORK
0
What then?
KING HENRY
0
An if he may, then am I lawful King;
YORK
0
He rose against him, being his sovereign,
WARWICK
0
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
EXETER
0
No; for he could not so resign his crown
KING HENRY
0
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
EXETER
0
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
YORK
0
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
EXETER
0
My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
KING HENRY
0
[Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
WARWICK
0
Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
CLIFFORD
0
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
KING HENRY
0
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
YORK
0
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
WARWICK
0
Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
KING HENRY
0
My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
YORK
0
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
KING HENRY
0
I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
CLIFFORD
0
What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
WARWICK
0
What good is this to England and himself!
WESTMORELAND
0
Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
CLIFFORD
0
How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
WESTMORELAND
0
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Nor I.
CLIFFORD
0
Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
WESTMORELAND
0
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Be thou a prey unto the house of York
CLIFFORD
0
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
WARWICK
0
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
EXETER
0
They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
KING HENRY
0
Ah, Exeter!
WARWICK
0
Why should you sigh, my lord?
KING HENRY
0
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
YORK
0
This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
WARWICK
0
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
KING HENRY
0
And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
YORK
0
Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
EXETER
0
Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
YORK
0
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
WARWICK
0
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
NORFOLK
0
And I to Norfolk with my followers.
MONTAGUE
0
And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
KING HENRY
0
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
EXETER
0
Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
KING HENRY
0
Exeter, so will I.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
KING HENRY
0
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Who can be patient in such extremes?
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Father, you cannot disinherit me.
KING HENRY
0
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be
KING HENRY
0
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
KING HENRY
0
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
When I return with victory from the field
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
KING HENRY
0
Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
EXETER
0
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt
RICHARD
0
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
EDWARD
0
No, I can better play the orator.
MONTAGUE
0
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
YORK
0
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
EDWARD
0
No quarrel, but a slight contention.
YORK
0
About what?
RICHARD
0
About that which concerns your Grace and us-
YORK
0
Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
RICHARD
0
Your right depends not on his life or death.
EDWARD
0
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
YORK
0
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
EDWARD
0
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
RICHARD
0
No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
YORK
0
I shall be, if I claim by open war.
RICHARD
0
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
YORK
0
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
RICHARD
0
An oath is of no moment, being not took
YORK
0
Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
MESSENGER
0
The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
YORK
0
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
MONTAGUE
0
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.
YORK
0
Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!
SIR JOHN
0
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
YORK
0
What, with five thousand men?
RICHARD
0
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.
EDWARD
0
I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,
YORK
0
Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,
RUTLAND
0
Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
CLIFFORD
0
Chaplain, away! Thy priesthood saves thy life.
TUTOR
0
And I, my lord, will bear him company.
CLIFFORD
0
Soldiers, away with him!
TUTOR
0
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
CLIFFORD
0
How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear
RUTLAND
0
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
CLIFFORD
0
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
RUTLAND
0
Then let my father's blood open it again:
CLIFFORD
0
Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
RUTLAND
0
O, let me pray before I take my death!
CLIFFORD
0
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
RUTLAND
0
I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
CLIFFORD
0
Thy father hath.
RUTLAND
0
But 'twas ere I was born.
CLIFFORD
0
No cause!
RUTLAND
0
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
CLIFFORD
0
Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet;
YORK
0
The army of the Queen hath got the field.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
CLIFFORD
0
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
YORK
0
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
CLIFFORD
0
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
YORK
0
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
CLIFFORD
0
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Hold, valiant Clifford; for a thousand causes
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
CLIFFORD
0
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
So doth the cony struggle in the net.
YORK
0
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
What would your Grace have done unto him now?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
CLIFFORD
0
That is my office, for my father's sake.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
YORK
0
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Beshrew me, but his passions move me so
YORK
0
That face of his the hungry cannibals
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
CLIFFORD
0
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
YORK
0
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
EDWARD
0
I wonder how our princely father scap'd,
RICHARD
0
I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
EDWARD
0
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
RICHARD
0
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
EDWARD
0
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
RICHARD
0
Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,
MESSENGER
0
Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
EDWARD
0
O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
RICHARD
0
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
MESSENGER
0
Environed he was with many foes,
EDWARD
0
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
RICHARD
0
I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
EDWARD
0
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
RICHARD
0
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
WARWICK
0
How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
RICHARD
0
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
EDWARD
0
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
WARWICK
0
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
EDWARD
0
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
WARWICK
0
Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
RICHARD
0
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
WARWICK
0
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
RICHARD
0
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
WARWICK
0
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
RICHARD
0
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
EDWARD
0
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
WARWICK
0
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
RICHARD
0
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
EDWARD
0
Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
WARWICK
0
How now! what news?
MESSENGER
0
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
WARWICK
0
Why, then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
KING HENRY
0
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
CLIFFORD
0
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
KING HENRY
0
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
KING HENRY
0
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
PRINCE OF WALES
0
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
CLIFFORD
0
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
MESSENGER
0
Royal commanders, be in readiness;
CLIFFORD
0
I would your Highness would depart the field:
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
KING HENRY
0
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
EDWARD
0
Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
EDWARD
0
I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
CLIFFORD
0
And reason too:
RICHARD
0
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
CLIFFORD
0
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
RICHARD
0
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
CLIFFORD
0
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
RICHARD
0
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
WARWICK
0
What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
WARWICK
0
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
CLIFFORD
0
You said so much before, and yet you fled.
WARWICK
0
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
NORTHUMBERLAND
0
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
RICHARD
0
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
CLIFFORD
0
I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
RICHARD
0
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
KING HENRY
0
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
KING HENRY
0
I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
CLIFFORD
0
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
RICHARD
0
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
EDWARD
0
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
WARWICK
0
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
PRINCE OF WALES
0
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
RICHARD
0
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
QUEEN MARGARET
0
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
RICHARD
0
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
EDWARD
0
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
GEORGE
0
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
EDWARD
0
And in this resolution I defy thee;
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Stay, Edward.
EDWARD
0
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;
WARWICK
0
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
EDWARD
0
Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
WARWICK
0
How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
GEORGE
0
Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;
EDWARD
0
Bootless is flight: they follow us with wings;
RICHARD
0
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
WARWICK
0
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.
EDWARD
0
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
RICHARD
0
Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
WARWICK
0
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
GEORGE
0
Yet let us all together to our troops,
RICHARD
0
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.
CLIFFORD
0
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
RICHARD
0
Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;
KING HENRY
0
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
SON
0
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
KING HENRY
0
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
FATHER
0
Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
KING HENRY
0
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
SON
0
How will my mother for a father's death
FATHER
0
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
KING HENRY
0
How will the country for these woeful chances
SON
0
Was ever son so rued a father's death?
FATHER
0
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
KING HENRY
0
Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?
SON
0
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
FATHER
0
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
KING HENRY
0
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
EXETER
0
Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
KING HENRY
0
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
CLIFFORD
0
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
EDWARD
0
Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause
WARWICK
0
No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
RICHARD
0
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
EDWARD
0
And now the battle's ended,
RICHARD
0
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
WARWICK
0
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
EDWARD
0
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
WARWICK
0
I think his understanding is bereft.
RICHARD
0
O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
GEORGE
0
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
RICHARD
0
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
EDWARD
0
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
WARWICK
0
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
GEORGE
0
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
RICHARD
0
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
EDWARD
0
Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
GEORGE
0
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
WARWICK
0
They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
RICHARD
0
What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
WARWICK
0
Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,
EDWARD
0
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
RICHARD
0
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
WARWICK
0
Tut, that's a foolish observation.
FIRST KEEPER
0
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
SECOND KEEPER
0
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
FIRST KEEPER
0
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
SECOND KEEPER
0
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
KING HENRY
0
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
FIRST KEEPER
0
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.
KING HENRY
0
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
SECOND KEEPER
0
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
FIRST KEEPER
0
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
KING HENRY
0
My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;
SECOND KEEPER
0
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
KING HENRY
0
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
SECOND KEEPER
0
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
KING HENRY
0
Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
SECOND KEEPER
0
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
KING HENRY
0
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
SECOND KEEPER
0
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
KING HENRY
0
But did you never swear, and break an oath?
SECOND KEEPER
0
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
KING HENRY
0
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
SECOND KEEPER
0
Here in this country, where we now remain.
KING HENRY
0
I was anointed king at nine months old;
FIRST KEEPER
0
No;
KING HENRY
0
Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
FIRST KEEPER
0
We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
KING HENRY
0
So would you be again to Henry,
FIRST KEEPER
0
We charge you, in God's name and the King's,
KING HENRY
0
In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;
KING EDWARD
0
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field
GLOUCESTER
0
Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
KING EDWARD
0
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
CLARENCE
0
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
KING EDWARD
0
Widow, we will consider of your suit;
LADY GREY
0
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your
CLARENCE
0
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take
KING EDWARD
0
How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.
CLARENCE
0
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather
LADY GREY
0
Three, my most gracious lord.
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
KING EDWARD
0
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
LADY GREY
0
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
KING EDWARD
0
Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
KING EDWARD
0
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
LADY GREY
0
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
KING EDWARD
0
And would you not do much to do them good?
LADY GREY
0
To do them good I would sustain some harm.
KING EDWARD
0
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
LADY GREY
0
Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
KING EDWARD
0
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
LADY GREY
0
So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
KING EDWARD
0
What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
LADY GREY
0
What you command that rests in me to do.
KING EDWARD
0
But you will take exceptions to my boon.
LADY GREY
0
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
KING EDWARD
0
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
LADY GREY
0
Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
GLOUCESTER
0
He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
CLARENCE
0
As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
LADY GREY
0
Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
KING EDWARD
0
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
LADY GREY
0
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
KING EDWARD
0
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
LADY GREY
0
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
GLOUCESTER
0
The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
KING EDWARD
0
But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
LADY GREY
0
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
KING EDWARD
0
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
LADY GREY
0
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
KING EDWARD
0
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
LADY GREY
0
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
KING EDWARD
0
But now you partly may perceive my mind.
LADY GREY
0
My mind will never grant what I perceive
KING EDWARD
0
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
LADY GREY
0
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
KING EDWARD
0
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
LADY GREY
0
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
KING EDWARD
0
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
LADY GREY
0
Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
KING EDWARD
0
Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
LADY GREY
0
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
GLOUCESTER
0
The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.
CLARENCE
0
He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.
KING EDWARD
0
[Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;
LADY GREY
0
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
KING EDWARD
0
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
LADY GREY
0
And that is more than I will yield unto.
KING EDWARD
0
You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.
LADY GREY
0
'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
KING EDWARD
0
o more than when my daughters call thee mother.
GLOUCESTER
0
The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
CLARENCE
0
When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.
KING EDWARD
0
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
GLOUCESTER
0
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
KING EDWARD
0
You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
CLARENCE
0
To who, my lord?
KING EDWARD
0
Why, Clarence, to myself.
GLOUCESTER
0
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
CLARENCE
0
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
GLOUCESTER
0
By so much is the wonder in extremes.
KING EDWARD
0
Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both
NOBLEMAN
0
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken
KING EDWARD
0
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
LEWIS
0
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret
LEWIS
0
Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
LEWIS
0
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
LEWIS
0
Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
LEWIS
0
The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
LEWIS
0
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
LEWIS
0
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
WARWICK
0
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
[Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
WARWICK
0
[To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
WARWICK
0
Injurious Margaret!
PRINCE OF WALES
0
And why not Queen?
WARWICK
0
Because thy father Henry did usurp;
OXFORD
0
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
WARWICK
0
Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
OXFORD
0
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
WARWICK
0
Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
OXFORD
0
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
WARWICK
0
And I the house of York.
LEWIS
0
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
LEWIS
0
Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
WARWICK
0
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
LEWIS
0
But is he gracious in the people's eye?
WARWICK
0
The more that Henry was unfortunate.
LEWIS
0
Then further: all dissembling set aside,
WARWICK
0
Such it seems
LEWIS
0
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
BONA
0
Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
LEWIS
0
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
To Edward, but not to the English king.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device
LEWIS
0
And still is friend to him and Margaret.
WARWICK
0
Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
LEWIS
0
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
POST
0
My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
OXFORD
0
I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.
LEWIS
0
Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.
WARWICK
0
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
LEWIS
0
What, has your king married the Lady Grey?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
I told your Majesty as much before.
WARWICK
0
King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
WARWICK
0
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
BONA
0
Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live
BONA
0
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
WARWICK
0
And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
LEWIS
0
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
LEWIS
0
Then, England's messenger, return in post
BONA
0
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
WARWICK
0
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
LEWIS
0
But, Warwick,
WARWICK
0
This shall assure my constant loyalty:
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
LEWIS
0
stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
WARWICK
0
I came from Edward as ambassador,
GLOUCESTER
0
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
CLARENCE
0
Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!
SOMERSET
0
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.
GLOUCESTER
0
And his well-chosen bride.
CLARENCE
0
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
KING EDWARD
0
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice
CLARENCE
0
As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,
KING EDWARD
0
Suppose they take offence without a cause;
GLOUCESTER
0
And shall have your will, because our King.
KING EDWARD
0
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
GLOUCESTER
0
Not I.
KING EDWARD
0
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
CLARENCE
0
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
GLOUCESTER
0
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
KING EDWARD
0
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
MONTAGUE
0
Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
HASTINGS
0
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
MONTAGUE
0
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
HASTINGS
0
'Tis better using France than trusting France.
CLARENCE
0
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
KING EDWARD
0
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
GLOUCESTER
0
And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
CLARENCE
0
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
KING EDWARD
0
Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
CLARENCE
0
In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
KING EDWARD
0
Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty
KING EDWARD
0
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
KING EDWARD
0
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
MESSENGER
0
My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
KING EDWARD
0
Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
MESSENGER
0
At my depart, these were his very words:
KING EDWARD
0
IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.
MESSENGER
0
These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:
KING EDWARD
0
I blame not her: she could say little less;
MESSENGER
0
'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,
KING EDWARD
0
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
MESSENGER
0
He, more incens'd against your Majesty
KING EDWARD
0
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
MESSENGER
0
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship
CLARENCE
0
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] Not I.
KING EDWARD
0
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
MONTAGUE
0
So God help Montague as he proves true!
HASTINGS
0
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
KING EDWARD
0
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
KING EDWARD
0
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
WARWICK
0
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
CLARENCE
0
Fear not that, my lord.
WARWICK
0
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
FIRST WATCHMAN
0
Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
SECOND WATCHMAN
0
What, will he not to bed?
FIRST WATCHMAN
0
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
SECOND WATCHMAN
0
To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
THIRD WATCHMAN
0
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
FIRST WATCHMAN
0
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
THIRD WATCHMAN
0
O, is it So? But why commands the King
SECOND WATCHMAN
0
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
THIRD WATCHMAN
0
Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
FIRST WATCHMAN
0
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
SECOND WATCHMAN
0
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
WARWICK
0
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
FIRST WATCHMAN
0
Who goes there?
SECOND WATCHMAN
0
Stay, or thou diest.
SECOND WATCHMAN
1
WARWICK
Stay, or thou diest.
       WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and
      set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK
                   and the rest following them
SOMERSET
1
WARWICK
What are they that fly there?
WARWICK
1
WARWICK
Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.
KING EDWARD
1
WARWICK
The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
WARWICK
1
WARWICK
Ay, but the case is alter'd.
KING EDWARD
1
WARWICK
Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
WARWICK
1
WARWICK
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;
KING EDWARD
1
WARWICK
What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
OXFORD
1
WARWICK
What now remains, my lords, for us to do
WARWICK
1
WARWICK
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
RIVERS
0
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
RIVERS
0
What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
No, but the loss of his own royal person.
RIVERS
0
Then is my sovereign slain?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;
RIVERS
0
These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Till then, fair hope must hinder life's decay.
RIVERS
0
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
I am inform'd that he comes towards London
GLOUCESTER
0
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
HUNTSMAN
0
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
KING EDWARD
0
Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.
GLOUCESTER
0
Brother, the time and case requireth haste;
KING EDWARD
0
But whither shall we then?
HASTINGS
0
To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
GLOUCESTER
0
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
KING EDWARD
0
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
GLOUCESTER
0
But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
KING EDWARD
0
Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?
HUNTSMAN
0
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
GLOUCESTER
0
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
KING EDWARD
0
Bishop, farewell. Shield thee from Warwick's frown,
KING HENRY
0
Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
LIEUTENANT
0
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;
KING HENRY
0
For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?
WARWICK
0
Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,
CLARENCE
0
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
WARWICK
0
And I choose Clarence only for Protector.
KING HENRY
0
Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.
WARWICK
0
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
CLARENCE
0
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
WARWICK
0
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.
CLARENCE
0
What else? And that succession be determin'd.
WARWICK
0
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
KING HENRY
0
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
CLARENCE
0
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
KING HENRY
0
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
SOMERSET
0
My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
KING HENRY
0
Come hither, England's hope.
WARWICK
0
What news, my friend?
POST
0
That Edward is escaped from your brother
WARWICK
0
Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?
POST
0
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
WARWICK
0
My brother was too careless of his charge.
SOMERSET
0
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
OXFORD
0
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
SOMERSET
0
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
KING EDWARD
0
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
GLOUCESTER
0
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
KING EDWARD
0
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
HASTINGS
0
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
MAYOR
0
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
KING EDWARD
0
But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,
MAYOR
0
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
KING EDWARD
0
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
HASTINGS
0
Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
MAYOR
0
Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.
GLOUCESTER
0
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
HASTINGS
0
The good old man would fain that all were well,
KING EDWARD
0
So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut
GLOUCESTER
0
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
KING EDWARD
0
Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?
MONTGOMERY
0
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
KING EDWARD
0
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
MONTGOMERY
0
Then fare you well, for I will hence again.
KING EDWARD
0
Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate
MONTGOMERY
0
What talk you of debating? In few words:
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
KING EDWARD
0
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
HASTINGS
0
Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
GLOUCESTER
0
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
KING EDWARD
0
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
MONTGOMERY
0
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
HASTINGS
0
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.
SOLDIER
0
[Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,
MONTGOMERY
0
And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,
ALL
0
Long live Edward the Fourth!
KING EDWARD
0
Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;
WARWICK
0
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
KING HENRY
0
Let's levy men and beat him back again.
CLARENCE
0
A little fire is quickly trodden out,
WARWICK
0
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
KING HENRY
0
Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.
CLARENCE
0
In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
KING HENRY
0
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
MONTAGUE
0
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
OXFORD
0
[Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid
KING HENRY
0
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
WARWICK
0
Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.
KING HENRY
0
Here at the palace will I rest a while.
EXETER
0
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
KING HENRY
0
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
EXETER
0
Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?
KING EDWARD
0
Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;
GLOUCESTER
0
Away betimes, before his forces join,
WARWICK
0
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
FIRST MESSENGER
0
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
WARWICK
0
How far off is our brother Montague?
SECOND MESSENGER
0
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
WARWICK
0
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
SOMERVILLE
0
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
WARWICK
0
Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.
SOMERVILLE
0
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
WARWICK
0
Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.
SOMERVILLE
0
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
KING EDWARD
0
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
GLOUCESTER
0
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
WARWICK
0
O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?
KING EDWARD
0
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
WARWICK
0
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
GLOUCESTER
0
I thought, at least, he would have said the King;
WARWICK
0
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
WARWICK
0
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
KING EDWARD
0
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
WARWICK
0
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
KING EDWARD
0
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner.
GLOUCESTER
0
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
KING EDWARD
0
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
GLOUCESTER
0
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.
WARWICK
0
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
KING EDWARD
0
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
WARWICK
0
O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.
OXFORD
0
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
GLOUCESTER
0
The gates are open, let us enter too.
KING EDWARD
0
So other foes may set upon our backs.
WARWICK
0
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
MONTAGUE
0
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
GLOUCESTER
0
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
KING EDWARD
0
The harder match'd, the greater victory.
SOMERSET
0
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
GLOUCESTER
0
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
WARWICK
0
And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,
CLARENCE
0
Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
KING EDWARD
0
Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?
WARWICK
0
Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.
CLARENCE
0
[Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
KING EDWARD
0
Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
GLOUCESTER
0
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
WARWICK
0
O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!
KING EDWARD
0
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?
WARWICK
0
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
KING EDWARD
0
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.
KING EDWARD
0
So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear;
WARWICK
0
Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
SOMERSET
0
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
WARWICK
0
Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
SOMERSET
0
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;
WARWICK
0
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:
OXFORD
0
Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
KING EDWARD
0
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
CLARENCE
0
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
GLOUCESTER
0
The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
KING EDWARD
0
are advertis'd by our loving friends
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
OXFORD
0
Women and children of so high a courage,
SOMERSET
0
And he that will not fight for such a hope,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
MESSENGER
0
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand
OXFORD
0
I thought no less. It is his policy
SOMERSET
0
But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
OXFORD
0
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
KING EDWARD
0
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
KING EDWARD
0
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
OXFORD
0
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
SOMERSET
0
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
So part we sadly in this troublous world,
KING EDWARD
0
Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
GLOUCESTER
0
It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.
KING EDWARD
0
Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!
GLOUCESTER
0
That you might still have worn the petticoat
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Let Aesop fable in a winter's night;
GLOUCESTER
0
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
GLOUCESTER
0
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
KING EDWARD
0
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
CLARENCE
0
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
PRINCE OF WALES
0
I know my duty; you are all undutiful.
KING EDWARD
0
Take that, the likeness of this railer here.
GLOUCESTER
0
Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.
CLARENCE
0
And there's for twitting me with perjury.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
O, kill me too!
GLOUCESTER
0
Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]
KING EDWARD
0
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
GLOUCESTER

Why should she live to fill the world with words?
KING EDWARD
0
What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
GLOUCESTER
0
Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother.
CLARENCE
0
What? what?
GLOUCESTER
0
The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
QUEEN MARGARET
0
O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!
KING EDWARD
0
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
CLARENCE
0
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
CLARENCE
0
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
KING EDWARD
0
Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
So come to you and yours as to this prince.
KING EDWARD
0
Where's Richard gone?
CLARENCE
0
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
KING EDWARD
0
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
GLOUCESTER
0
Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
KING HENRY
0
Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
GLOUCESTER
0
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
KING HENRY
0
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
GLOUCESTER
0
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
KING HENRY
0
The bird that hath been limed in a bush
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
KING HENRY
0
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
GLOUCESTER
0
Think'st thou I am an executioner?
KING HENRY
0
A persecutor I am sure thou art.
GLOUCESTER
0
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
KING HENRY
0
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
GLOUCESTER
0
I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.
KING HENRY
0
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
GLOUCESTER
0
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
KING EDWARD
0
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
GLOUCESTER
0
[Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;
KING EDWARD
0
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
CLARENCE
0
The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
KING EDWARD
0
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
GLOUCESTER
0
And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
KING EDWARD
0
Now am I seated as my soul delights,
CLARENCE
0
What will your Grace have done with Margaret?
KING EDWARD
0
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
