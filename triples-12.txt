1
DUKE OF YORK

1
DUKE OF YORK

  YORK.

DUKE OF YORK

  NORFOLK.

DUKE OF YORK
RFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
  RICHARD. 
1
DUKE OF YORK
CHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
  WARWICK. 
1
DUKE OF YORK
RWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
  YORK. 
1
DUKE OF YORK
RK. Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;

1
DUKE OF YORK
RFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

DUKE OF YORK

DUKE OF YORK
RWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence.

  WARWICK. 
1
DUKE OF YORK
RWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
    The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
    Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.
    I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
    Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

2
DUKE OF YORK

DUKE OF YORK

  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  YORK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  MONTAGUE. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
  RICHARD.

DUKE OF YORK

  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RK. What then?
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,

DUKE OF YORK

DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  WARWICK. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;

DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,

DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY

  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
DUKE OF YORK

RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD. 
2
DUKE OF YORK
KING HENRY
IFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,

DUKE OF YORK

DUKE OF YORK

2
QUEEN MARGARET
DUKE OF YORK
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
                                         [A short alarum within]
    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

  CLIFFORD.

KING HENRY

  NORTHUMBERLAND.

  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
KING HENRY

  CLIFFORD.

  EDWARD.

WARWICK
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
    To execute the like upon thyself;
    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]

KING HENRY
  KING 
1
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  KING 
2
Father
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]

    Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother,
    Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands
    He hath good usage and great liberty;
    And often but attended with weak guard
    Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
    I have advertis'd him by secret means
    That if about this hour he make this way,
    Under the colour of his usual game,
    He shall here find his friends, with horse and men,
    To set him free from his captivity.

KING EDWARD

    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands

  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
DUKE OF YORK

  YORK. 
2
EDWARD
DUKE OF YORK

  RICHARD.

EDWARD
DUKE OF YORK
CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK.

EDWARD
DUKE OF YORK

  RICHARD.

DUKE OF YORK

  YORK. 
2
EDWARD
DUKE OF YORK

  EDWARD.

EDWARD
DUKE OF YORK

DUKE OF YORK
CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.

DUKE OF YORK

EDWARD
MESSENGER
DUKE OF YORK

    Brother, thou shalt to London presently
    And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
    Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
    And tell him privily of our intent.
    You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
    While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more
    But that I seek occasion how to rise,
    And yet the King not privy to my drift,
    Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

  YORK. 
2
QUEEN MARGARET
DUKE OF YORK
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
                                         [A short alarum within]
    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
  NORTHUMBERLAND.

QUEEN MARGARET

    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;

    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother

KING HENRY
  KING 
1
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  KING 
2
Father
KING HENRY
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]

    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
    Is nothing left me but my body's length.
    what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
    And live we how we can, yet die we must.

NG HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD.

CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD.

NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING

YORK
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
1

  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. What then?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING

YORK
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER.

YORK
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK.

  EXETER.

ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING

RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power

  WARWICK.

RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD.

  WARWICK.

  KING

YORK
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING

  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD

  YORK.

  RICHARD.

EDWARD

CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK.

  RICHARD.

EDWARD

CHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
  EDWARD.

EDWARD

WARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
  YORK. 
2
EDWARD
YORK

  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
YORK
WARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD

CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
  YORK. 
2
EDWARD
YORK
RK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
YORK
CHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
  YORK. 
2
EDWARD
YORK
RK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD

CHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not took
  YORK. 
2
EDWARD
YORK

  YORK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
YORK
RK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
    Brother, thou shalt to London presently
    And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
    Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
    And tell him privily of our intent.
    You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
    While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more
    But that I seek occasion how to rise,
    And yet the King not privy to my drift,
    Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
                                         [A short alarum within]
    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
    Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
    And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother

NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]

  RICHARD.

  SECOND

  KING

CLIFFORD

  SECOND

EDWARD

    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
    Is nothing left me but my body's length.
    what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
    And live we how we can, yet die we must.

  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. I am thine.
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
1
YORK
CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD. 
1
YORK
WARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
  MONTAGUE. 
1
YORK
NTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
  RICHARD. 
1
YORK
CHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Sons, peace!
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. What then?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
  CLIFFORD. 
1

  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
  EXETER. 
1

ETER. They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
  EXETER.

ETER. Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
  YORK. 
1

  KING

  EDWARD.

  RICHARD.

CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK.

  RICHARD.

CHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
  EDWARD.

WARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
  YORK.

EDWARD

  EDWARD.

EDWARD

  RICHARD.

EDWARD

CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
  YORK. 
2
EDWARD

  RICHARD.

EDWARD

CHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
  YORK.

  RICHARD.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
YORK
RK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
    Brother, thou shalt to London presently
    And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
    Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
    And tell him privily of our intent.
    You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
    While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more
    But that I seek occasion how to rise,
    And yet the King not privy to my drift,
    Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

1
YORK
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
                                         [A short alarum within]
    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD

IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING

  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,

2
EDWARD
MESSENGER

  GEORGE.

RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
    Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
    And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

2
RICHARD
WARWICK
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
    To execute the like upon thyself;
    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]

  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]

2
EDWARD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
2

2

  WARWICK. 
2

CLIFFORD
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
2

  FIRST

  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING

  SECOND 
2

CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING

  SECOND 
2

  SECOND

  KING

CLIFFORD

  SECOND

  KING

  LADY

  LADY

  KING

DY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  KING

NG EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  LADY 
1

DY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  KING

NG EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
  LADY 
1

DY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  KING

  LADY

  LADY 
1

  KING

  LADY 
1

DY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  GLOUCESTER.

  KING

    Above the border of this horizon,
    We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
    For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
    Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems the

EDWARD
RWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
    Is nothing left me but my body's length.
    what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
    And live we how we can, yet die we must.

    I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
    Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1

RTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
  CLIFFORD.

  WESTMORELAND.

STMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. I am thine.
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK. 
1

RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD.

CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD.

  KING

NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. What then?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,

YORK
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND.

YORK
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND.

RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD.

RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York

  WARWICK.

  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  YORK.

YORK

  WARWICK.

YORK
RWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
  KING

YORK
NG HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
  YORK.

    Brother, thou shalt to London presently
    And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
    Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
    And tell him privily of our intent.
    You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
    While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more
    But that I seek occasion how to rise,
    And yet the King not privy to my drift,
    Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

YORK

    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
                                         [A short alarum within]
    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

EEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
  KING

NG HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
  QUEEN

EEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
  KING

NG HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  PRINCE

INCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
  CLIFFORD.

MESSENGER
IFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

1
MESSENGER
SSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;
  CLIFFORD. 
1
MESSENGER
IFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:
  QUEEN 
1
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
  KING 
1
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
INCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
    And hearten those that fight in your defence.
    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
ORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;

2
EDWARD
WARWICK
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
    Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
    And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
  EDWARD.

EDWARD
WARWICK

EDWARD

WARWICK
RWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
  GEORGE. 
3
EDWARD
GEORGE
WARWICK
ORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;

EDWARD
GEORGE
WARWICK

  CLIFFORD.

RICHARD
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
RICHARD
WARWICK
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
    To execute the like upon thyself;
    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]
  RICHARD.

RICHARD
WARWICK

  KING

NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

    Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
    Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
    Weep, wretched man; I'll aid thee tear for tear;
    And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
    Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief.

CLIFFORD

  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]
  EDWARD.

EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. And now the battle's ended,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
ORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
ORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.
    Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London
    To see these honours in possession.                   Exeunt

  SECOND

  FIRST 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
  FIRST 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
  FIRST 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;
  FIRST 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RST KEEPER. No;
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
  FIRST 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
  KING 
2

CLIFFORD

  FIRST 
2

CLIFFORD
RST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,

  KING

NG EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
  GLOUCESTER. 
1

OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
  GLOUCESTER.

  CLARENCE. 
1

ARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
1

OUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
  KING 
1

NG EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  LADY 
1

DY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive
  KING

  LADY 
1

DY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
  LADY 
1
EDWARD
DY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
  KING 
1

NG EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
  LADY 
1

EDWARD
RWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
    Is nothing left me but my body's length.
    what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
    And live we how we can, yet die we must.

    Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
  CLIFFORD. 
1

IFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
  WESTMORELAND.

STMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
  CLIFFORD. 
1

IFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
  EXETER. 
1

ETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
  KING

1
YORK

  EXETER.

ETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
  YORK.

  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
  WARWICK.

YORK
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD.

YORK
IFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?
  WARWICK.

RWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
  KING

  WARWICK.

RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND.

STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK.

RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND.

IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK.

  KING

YORK
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
1

CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD.

  MONTAGUE.

NTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,

  KING

NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING

YORK
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
1

  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. What then?
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
1
YORK
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
1
YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
1
YORK
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,

YORK
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
1
YORK
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
1
YORK
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,

IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK.

RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
1
YORK
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND.

YORK
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND.

YORK
RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD.

RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York

  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING

    You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
    With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
    In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
    Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
    While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more

    And yet the King not privy to my drift,

    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
                                         [A short alarum within]
    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
    The sands are numb'red that make up my life;
    Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
  EDWARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  EDWARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. How now! what news?
  MESSENGER. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
SSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
  WARWICK.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK

  KING

NG HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
  CLIFFORD.

IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING

NG HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
  QUEEN

EEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,

MESSENGER
SSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;
  CLIFFORD.

MESSENGER
IFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:
  QUEEN

  KING 
1
MESSENGER

  PRINCE

    And hearten those that fight in your defence.
    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
ORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;
  QUEEN

2
EDWARD
WARWICK
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
    Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
    And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
  EDWARD.

  GEORGE.

EDWARD

2
RICHARD
WARWICK
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
    To execute the like upon thyself;
    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]

  KING

NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]

  WARWICK.

CLIFFORD
CHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
  EDWARD. 
2

2

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
ORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
WARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
2

CLIFFORD

2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  EDWARD. 
2

  FIRST 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING 
2

CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2

CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
  KING 
2

CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
NG HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.

    If secret powers
    Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
    This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
    His looks are full of peaceful majesty;
    His head by nature fram'd to wear a crown,
    His hand to wield a sceptre; and himself
    Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
    Make much of him, my lords; for this is he
    Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
    Is nothing left me but my body's length.
    what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
    And live we how we can, yet die we must.

  WARWICK. 
1
YORK
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING

  WARWICK.

    My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
    And all my followers to the eager foe
    Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
    Like men born to renown by life or death.
    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
    And full as oft came Edward to my side
    With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
    In blood of those that had encount'red him.
    And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
    Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'
    And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
    A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
    We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan
    With bootless labour swim against the tide
    And spend her strength with over-matching waves.

    Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,
    And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
    And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.

    You love the breeder better than the male.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
SSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  MESSENGER. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
SSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,

2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
    Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun;
    For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom, say:
    Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
  WARWICK.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  EDWARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
  EDWARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
  EDWARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
RWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
  RICHARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
CHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  EDWARD. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK
WARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
  WARWICK. 
3
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK

  MESSENGER.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARWICK

  KING

IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING

  KING

    And hearten those that fight in your defence.
    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
2
EDWARD
MESSENGER
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD.

EDWARD
MESSENGER
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,

  GEORGE.

2
EDWARD
WARWICK
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
    I lay me down a little while to breathe;
    For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
    Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
    And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
  EDWARD.

2
RICHARD
WARWICK
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
    To execute the like upon thyself;
    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]

  KING

NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
    When dying clouds contend with growing light,
    What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
    Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
    Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
    Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;
    Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
    Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.
    Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
    Now one the better, then another best;
    Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
    Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.
    So is the equal poise of this fell war.
    Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
    To whom God will, there be the victory!
    For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
    Have chid me from the battle, swearing both
    They prosper best of all when I am thence.
    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
    For what is in this world but grief and woe?
    O God! methinks it were a happy life
    To be no better than a homely swain;
    To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
    To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
    Thereby to see the minutes how they run-
    How many makes the hour full complete,
    How many hours brings about the day,
    How many days will finish up the year,
    How many years a mortal man may live.
    When this is known, then to divide the times-
    So many hours must I tend my flock;
    So many hours must I take my rest;
    So many hours must I contemplate;
    So many hours must I sport myself;
    So many days my ewes have been with young;
    So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;
    So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
    So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
    Pass'd over to the end they were created,
    Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
    To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
    Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
    To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
    O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
    And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
    His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
    His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
    All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
    Is far beyond a prince's delicates-
    His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
    His body couched in a curious bed,
    When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
    Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
    O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
    More than my body's parting with my soul!
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
    And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
    Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.
    The common people swarm like summer flies;
    And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
    And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
    O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
    That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,
    Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
    And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
    Or as thy father and his father did,
    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
    They never then had sprung like summer flies;
    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
    Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.
    No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
    The foe is merciless and will not pity;
    For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.
    The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
    And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
    Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
    I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.
                                                     [He faints]

  WARWICK.

  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  RICHARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  EDWARD. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
2

EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  WARWICK. 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

2

  FIRST

  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING

CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2

CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING

  SECOND 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  KING

  SECOND

  SECOND

CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING 
2
EDWARD
CLIFFORD

  SECOND 
2

CLIFFORD
COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.

    And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
    Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
    My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
    That I must yield my body to the earth
    And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
    Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
    Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
    To search the secret treasons of the world;
    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
    Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
    For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?
    And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
    Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
    My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,
    Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
    Is nothing left me but my body's length.
    what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?

  CLARENCE.

OUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
  GLOUCESTER.

  KING

OUCESTER. [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;
  KING

EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  CLARENCE. 
1
EDWARD
ARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
  KING 
1
EDWARD
NG EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
1

OUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
  KING

NG EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights,

  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence.
  YORK. 
0
RK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
  YORK. 
0
RK. I am thine.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK. 
0
RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sons, peace!
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
0
RK. What then?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
0
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
0
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  YORK. 
0
RK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. And I to Norfolk with my followers.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Exeter, so will I.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Who can be patient in such extremes?
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Father, you cannot disinherit me.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, I can better play the orator.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No quarrel, but a slight contention.
  YORK. 
0
RK. About what?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not took
  YORK. 
0
RK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
  YORK. 
0
RK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!
  SIR 
0
R JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
  YORK. 
0
RK. What, with five thousand men?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Chaplain, away! Thy priesthood saves thy life.
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. And I, my lord, will bear him company.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Soldiers, away with him!
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Then let my father's blood open it again:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Thy father hath.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. But 'twas ere I was born.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. No cause!
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet;
  YORK. 
0
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
  YORK. 
0
RK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
  YORK. 
0
RK. O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I will not bandy with thee word for word,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Hold, valiant Clifford; for a thousand causes
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net.
  YORK. 
0
RK. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. That is my office, for my father's sake.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
  YORK. 
0
RK. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so
  YORK. 
0
RK. That face of his the hungry cannibals
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now! what news?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING

NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bootless is flight: they follow us with wings;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Yet let us all together to our troops,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  SON. 
0
N. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
  SON. 
0
N. How will my mother for a father's death
  FATHER. 
0
THER. How will my wife for slaughter of my son
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances
  SON. 
0
N. Was ever son so rued a father's death?
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?
  SON. 
0
N. I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
  FATHER. 
0
THER. These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And now the battle's ended,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. No;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Widow, we will consider of your suit;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Three, my most gracious lord.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. [Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. And that is more than I will yield unto.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD.No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To who, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both
  NOBLEMAN. 
0
BLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Injurious Margaret!
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And why not Queen?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I the house of York.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then further: all dissembling set aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Such it seems
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  BONA. 
0
NA. Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And still is friend to him and Margaret.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
  POST. 
0
ST. My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
  BONA. 
0
NA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live
  BONA. 
0
NA. My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, England's messenger, return in post
  BONA. 
0
NA. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But, Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I came from Edward as ambassador,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And his well-chosen bride.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. 'Tis better using France than trusting France.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. At my depart, these were his very words:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Fear not that, my lord.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. What, will he not to bed?
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
  SECOND

COND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Who goes there?
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. What are they that fly there?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Then is my sovereign slain?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Till then, fair hope must hinder life's decay.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. I am inform'd that he comes towards London
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But whither shall we then?
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bishop, farewell. Shield thee from Warwick's frown,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What else? And that succession be determin'd.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Come hither, England's hope.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What news, my friend?
  POST. 
0
ST. That Edward is escaped from your brother
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?
  POST. 
0
ST. He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. My brother was too careless of his charge.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Then fare you well, for I will hence again.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words:
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,
  ALL. 
0
L. Long live Edward the Fourth!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let's levy men and beat him back again.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little fire is quickly trodden out,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
  FIRST 
0
RST MESSENGER. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How far off is our brother Montague?
  SECOND 
0
COND MESSENGER. By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. are advertis'd by our loving friends
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Women and children of so high a courage,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. And he that will not fight for such a hope,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I thought no less. It is his policy
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Let Aesop fable in a winter's night;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are all undutiful.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. And there's for twitting me with perjury.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, kill me too!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What? what?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So come to you and yours as to this prince.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Where's Richard gone?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  CLARENCE.

ARENCE. What will your Grace have done with Margaret?

RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sons, peace!
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
0
RK. What then?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
0
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
0
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  YORK. 
0
RK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. And I to Norfolk with my followers.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Exeter, so will I.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Who can be patient in such extremes?
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Father, you cannot disinherit me.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, I can better play the orator.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No quarrel, but a slight contention.
  YORK. 
0
RK. About what?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not took
  YORK. 
0
RK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
  YORK. 
0
RK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!
  SIR 
0
R JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
  YORK. 
0
RK. What, with five thousand men?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Chaplain, away! Thy priesthood saves thy life.
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. And I, my lord, will bear him company.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Soldiers, away with him!
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Then let my father's blood open it again:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Thy father hath.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. But 'twas ere I was born.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. No cause!
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet;
  YORK. 
0
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
  YORK. 
0
RK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
  YORK. 
0
RK. O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I will not bandy with thee word for word,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Hold, valiant Clifford; for a thousand causes
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net.
  YORK. 
0
RK. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. That is my office, for my father's sake.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
  YORK. 
0
RK. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so
  YORK. 
0
RK. That face of his the hungry cannibals
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now! what news?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bootless is flight: they follow us with wings;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Yet let us all together to our troops,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  SON. 
0
N. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
  SON. 
0
N. How will my mother for a father's death
  FATHER. 
0
THER. How will my wife for slaughter of my son
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances
  SON. 
0
N. Was ever son so rued a father's death?
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?
  SON. 
0
N. I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
  FATHER. 
0
THER. These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And now the battle's ended,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.
  FIRST

RST KEEPER. Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
  SECOND

COND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.

RST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
  SECOND

COND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  KING

  SECOND

  KING

NG HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
  SECOND

COND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  KING

NG HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
  SECOND

COND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING

NG HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?

COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. No;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Widow, we will consider of your suit;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Three, my most gracious lord.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. [Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. And that is more than I will yield unto.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD.No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To who, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both
  NOBLEMAN. 
0
BLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.
  GLOUCESTER.

OUCESTER. Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Injurious Margaret!
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And why not Queen?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I the house of York.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then further: all dissembling set aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Such it seems
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  BONA. 
0
NA. Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And still is friend to him and Margaret.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
  POST. 
0
ST. My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
  BONA. 
0
NA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live
  BONA. 
0
NA. My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, England's messenger, return in post
  BONA. 
0
NA. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But, Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I came from Edward as ambassador,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And his well-chosen bride.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. 'Tis better using France than trusting France.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. At my depart, these were his very words:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Fear not that, my lord.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. What, will he not to bed?
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Who goes there?
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
  SECOND 
1
WARWICK
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
       WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and
      set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK
                   and the rest following them
  SOMERSET. 
1
WARWICK
MERSET. What are they that fly there?
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
  OXFORD. 
1
WARWICK
FORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Then is my sovereign slain?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Till then, fair hope must hinder life's decay.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. I am inform'd that he comes towards London
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But whither shall we then?
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bishop, farewell. Shield thee from Warwick's frown,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What else? And that succession be determin'd.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Come hither, England's hope.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What news, my friend?
  POST. 
0
ST. That Edward is escaped from your brother
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?
  POST. 
0
ST. He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. My brother was too careless of his charge.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Then fare you well, for I will hence again.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words:
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,
  ALL. 
0
L. Long live Edward the Fourth!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let's levy men and beat him back again.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little fire is quickly trodden out,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
  FIRST 
0
RST MESSENGER. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How far off is our brother Montague?
  SECOND 
0
COND MESSENGER. By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. are advertis'd by our loving friends
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Women and children of so high a courage,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. And he that will not fight for such a hope,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I thought no less. It is his policy
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Let Aesop fable in a winter's night;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are all undutiful.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. And there's for twitting me with perjury.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, kill me too!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What? what?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So come to you and yours as to this prince.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Where's Richard gone?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What will your Grace have done with Margaret?
  KING

WARD. Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence.
  YORK. 
0
RK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
  YORK. 
0
RK. I am thine.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK. 
0
RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
  MONTAGUE.

  YORK.

RK. Sons, peace!
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
0
RK. What then?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
0
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
0
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  YORK. 
0
RK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. And I to Norfolk with my followers.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Exeter, so will I.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Who can be patient in such extremes?
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Father, you cannot disinherit me.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, I can better play the orator.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No quarrel, but a slight contention.
  YORK. 
0
RK. About what?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not took
  YORK. 
0
RK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
  YORK. 
0
RK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!
  SIR 
0
R JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
  YORK. 
0
RK. What, with five thousand men?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Chaplain, away! Thy priesthood saves thy life.
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. And I, my lord, will bear him company.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Soldiers, away with him!
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Then let my father's blood open it again:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Thy father hath.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. But 'twas ere I was born.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. No cause!
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet;
  YORK. 
0
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
  YORK. 
0
RK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
  YORK. 
0
RK. O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I will not bandy with thee word for word,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Hold, valiant Clifford; for a thousand causes
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net.
  YORK. 
0
RK. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. That is my office, for my father's sake.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
  YORK. 
0
RK. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so
  YORK. 
0
RK. That face of his the hungry cannibals
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now! what news?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bootless is flight: they follow us with wings;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Yet let us all together to our troops,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  SON. 
0
N. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
  SON. 
0
N. How will my mother for a father's death
  FATHER. 
0
THER. How will my wife for slaughter of my son
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances
  SON. 
0
N. Was ever son so rued a father's death?
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?
  SON. 
0
N. I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
  FATHER. 
0
THER. These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And now the battle's ended,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. No;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Widow, we will consider of your suit;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Three, my most gracious lord.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. [Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. And that is more than I will yield unto.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD.No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To who, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.
  KING

NG EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both
  NOBLEMAN. 
0
BLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Injurious Margaret!
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And why not Queen?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I the house of York.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then further: all dissembling set aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Such it seems
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  BONA. 
0
NA. Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And still is friend to him and Margaret.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
  POST. 
0
ST. My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
  BONA. 
0
NA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live
  BONA. 
0
NA. My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, England's messenger, return in post
  BONA. 
0
NA. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But, Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I came from Edward as ambassador,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And his well-chosen bride.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. 'Tis better using France than trusting France.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. At my depart, these were his very words:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Fear not that, my lord.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. What, will he not to bed?
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Who goes there?
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
  SECOND 
1
WARWICK
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
       WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and
      set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK
                   and the rest following them
  SOMERSET. 
1
WARWICK
MERSET. What are they that fly there?
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
  OXFORD. 
1
WARWICK
FORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Then is my sovereign slain?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Till then, fair hope must hinder life's decay.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. I am inform'd that he comes towards London
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But whither shall we then?
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bishop, farewell. Shield thee from Warwick's frown,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What else? And that succession be determin'd.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Come hither, England's hope.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What news, my friend?
  POST. 
0
ST. That Edward is escaped from your brother
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?
  POST. 
0
ST. He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. My brother was too careless of his charge.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Then fare you well, for I will hence again.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words:
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,
  ALL. 
0
L. Long live Edward the Fourth!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let's levy men and beat him back again.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little fire is quickly trodden out,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
  FIRST 
0
RST MESSENGER. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How far off is our brother Montague?
  SECOND 
0
COND MESSENGER. By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,

0
NG EDWARD. are advertis'd by our loving friends
  QUEEN

  PRINCE

INCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I thought no less. It is his policy
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Let Aesop fable in a winter's night;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are all undutiful.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. And there's for twitting me with perjury.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, kill me too!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What? what?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So come to you and yours as to this prince.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Where's Richard gone?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What will your Grace have done with Margaret?
  KING

  MONTAGUE.

NTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.
  YORK.

  NORFOLK.

RFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence.
  YORK. 
0
RK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
  YORK. 
0
RK. I am thine.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
  YORK. 
0
RK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sons, peace!
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
  YORK. 
0
RK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
  YORK. 
0
RK. What then?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;
  YORK. 
0
RK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
  YORK. 
0
RK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
  WESTMORELAND. 
0
STMORELAND. Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ah, Exeter!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
  YORK. 
0
RK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
  YORK. 
0
RK. Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
  NORFOLK. 
0
RFOLK. And I to Norfolk with my followers.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Exeter, so will I.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Who can be patient in such extremes?
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Father, you cannot disinherit me.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, I can better play the orator.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No quarrel, but a slight contention.
  YORK. 
0
RK. About what?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
  YORK. 
0
RK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
  YORK. 
0
RK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not took
  YORK. 
0
RK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
  YORK. 
0
RK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!
  SIR 
0
R JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
  YORK. 
0
RK. What, with five thousand men?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,
  YORK. 
0
RK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Chaplain, away! Thy priesthood saves thy life.
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. And I, my lord, will bear him company.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Soldiers, away with him!
  TUTOR. 
0
TOR. Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Then let my father's blood open it again:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Thy father hath.
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. But 'twas ere I was born.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. No cause!
  RUTLAND. 
0
TLAND. Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet;
  YORK. 
0
RK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
  YORK. 
0
RK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
  YORK. 
0
RK. O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I will not bandy with thee word for word,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Hold, valiant Clifford; for a thousand causes
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net.
  YORK. 
0
RK. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. That is my office, for my father's sake.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
  YORK. 
0
RK. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so
  YORK. 
0
RK. That face of his the hungry cannibals
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
  YORK. 
0
RK. Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now! what news?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. And reason too:
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. 
0
RTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bootless is flight: they follow us with wings;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Yet let us all together to our troops,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,
  SON. 
0
N. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
  SON. 
0
N. How will my mother for a father's death
  FATHER. 
0
THER. How will my wife for slaughter of my son
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances
  SON. 
0
N. Was ever son so rued a father's death?
  FATHER. 
0
THER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?
  SON. 
0
N. I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
  FATHER. 
0
THER. These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
  CLIFFORD. 
0
IFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. And now the battle's ended,
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
  GEORGE. 
0
ORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,
  EDWARD. 
0
WARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
  RICHARD. 
0
CHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
  SECOND 
0
COND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. No;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,
  FIRST 
0
RST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Widow, we will consider of your suit;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Three, my most gracious lord.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. [Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. And that is more than I will yield unto.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.
  LADY 
0
DY GREY. 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD.No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To who, my lord?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both
  NOBLEMAN. 
0
BLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Injurious Margaret!
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And why not Queen?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I the house of York.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then further: all dissembling set aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Such it seems
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
  BONA. 
0
NA. Your grant or your denial shall be mine.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And still is friend to him and Margaret.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
  POST. 
0
ST. My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
  BONA. 
0
NA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live
  BONA. 
0
NA. My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. Then, England's messenger, return in post
  BONA. 
0
NA. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. But, Warwick,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
  LEWIS. 
0
WIS. stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I came from Edward as ambassador,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And his well-chosen bride.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. 'Tis better using France than trusting France.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. At my depart, these were his very words:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] Not I.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Fear not that, my lord.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. What, will he not to bed?
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
  THIRD 
0
IRD WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
  FIRST 
0
RST WATCHMAN. Who goes there?
  SECOND 
0
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
  SECOND 
1
WARWICK
COND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
       WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and
      set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK
                   and the rest following them
  SOMERSET. 
1
WARWICK
MERSET. What are they that fly there?
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;
  KING 
1
WARWICK
NG EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
  OXFORD. 
1
WARWICK
FORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do
  WARWICK. 
1
WARWICK
RWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. Then is my sovereign slain?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. Till then, fair hope must hinder life's decay.
  RIVERS. 
0
VERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN ELIZABETH. I am inform'd that he comes towards London
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But whither shall we then?
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?
  HUNTSMAN. 
0
NTSMAN. Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bishop, farewell. Shield thee from Warwick's frown,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
  LIEUTENANT. 
0
EUTENANT. Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What else? And that succession be determin'd.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Come hither, England's hope.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What news, my friend?
  POST. 
0
ST. That Edward is escaped from your brother
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?
  POST. 
0
ST. He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. My brother was too careless of his charge.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
  MAYOR. 
0
YOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Then fare you well, for I will hence again.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words:
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
  HASTINGS. 
0
STINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.
  SOLDIER. 
0
LDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,
  MONTGOMERY. 
0
NTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,
  ALL. 
0
L. Long live Edward the Fourth!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Let's levy men and beat him back again.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little fire is quickly trodden out,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while.
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
  EXETER. 
0
ETER. Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
  FIRST 
0
RST MESSENGER. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. How far off is our brother Montague?
  SECOND 
0
COND MESSENGER. By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.
  SOMERVILLE. 
0
MERVILLE. They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
  MONTAGUE. 
0
NTAGUE. Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;
  WARWICK. 
0
RWICK. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. are advertis'd by our loving friends
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Women and children of so high a courage,
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. And he that will not fight for such a hope,
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. I thought no less. It is his policy
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
  OXFORD. 
0
FORD. For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
  SOMERSET. 
0
MERSET. Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Let Aesop fable in a winter's night;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
  PRINCE 
0
INCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are all undutiful.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. And there's for twitting me with perjury.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O, kill me too!
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What? what?
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.
  QUEEN 
0
EEN MARGARET. So come to you and yours as to this prince.
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Where's Richard gone?
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner?
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.
  KING 
0
NG HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
  GLOUCESTER. 
0
OUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights,
  CLARENCE. 
0
ARENCE. What will your Grace have done with Margaret?
  KING 
0
NG EDWARD. Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
