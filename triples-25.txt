GLOUCESTER
0
Now is the winter of our discontent
CLARENCE
0
His Majesty,
GLOUCESTER
0
Upon what cause?
CLARENCE
0
Because my name is George.
GLOUCESTER
0
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
CLARENCE
0
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
CLARENCE
0
By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
GLOUCESTER
0
Humbly complaining to her deity
BRAKENBURY
0
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
GLOUCESTER
0
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
BRAKENBURY
0
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
GLOUCESTER
0
Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
BRAKENBURY
0
What one, my lord?
GLOUCESTER
0
Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
BRAKENBURY
0
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
CLARENCE
0
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
GLOUCESTER
0
We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.
CLARENCE
0
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
GLOUCESTER
0
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
CLARENCE
0
I must perforce. Farewell.
GLOUCESTER
0
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
HASTINGS
0
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
GLOUCESTER
0
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
HASTINGS
0
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
GLOUCESTER
0
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
HASTINGS
0
More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
GLOUCESTER
0
What news abroad?
HASTINGS
0
No news so bad abroad as this at home:
GLOUCESTER
0
Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
HASTINGS
0
He is.
GLOUCESTER
0
Go you before, and I will follow you.
ANNE
0
Set down, set down your honourable load-
GLOUCESTER
0
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
ANNE
0
What black magician conjures up this fiend
GLOUCESTER
0
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
GLOUCESTER
0
Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.
ANNE
0
What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
GLOUCESTER
0
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
ANNE
0
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
GLOUCESTER
0
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
ANNE
0
Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
GLOUCESTER
0
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
ANNE
0
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
GLOUCESTER
0
More wonderful when angels are so angry.
ANNE
0
Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
GLOUCESTER
0
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
ANNE
0
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
GLOUCESTER
0
By such despair I should accuse myself.
ANNE
0
And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
GLOUCESTER
0
Say that I slew them not?
ANNE
0
Then say they were not slain.
GLOUCESTER
0
I did not kill your husband.
ANNE
0
Why, then he is alive.
GLOUCESTER
0
Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
ANNE
0
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
GLOUCESTER
0
I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
ANNE
0
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
GLOUCESTER
0
I grant ye.
ANNE
0
Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
GLOUCESTER
0
The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
ANNE
0
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
GLOUCESTER
0
Let him thank me that holp to send him
ANNE
0
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
GLOUCESTER
0
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
ANNE
0
Some dungeon.
GLOUCESTER
0
Your bed-chamber.
ANNE
0
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
GLOUCESTER
0
So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
ANNE
0
I hope so.
GLOUCESTER
0
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
ANNE
0
Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
GLOUCESTER
0
Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
ANNE
0
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
GLOUCESTER
0
These eyes could not endure that beauty's
ANNE
0
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
GLOUCESTER
0
Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
ANNE
0
I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
GLOUCESTER
0
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
ANNE
0
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
GLOUCESTER
0
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
ANNE
0
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
GLOUCESTER
0
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
ANNE
0
Name him.
GLOUCESTER
0
Plantagenet.
ANNE
0
Why, that was he.
GLOUCESTER
0
The self-same name, but one of better nature.
ANNE
0
Where is he?
GLOUCESTER
0
Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit
ANNE
0
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
GLOUCESTER
0
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
ANNE
0
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
GLOUCESTER
0
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
ANNE
0
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
GLOUCESTER
0
I would they were, that I might die at once;
ANNE
0
Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
GLOUCESTER
0
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
ANNE
0
I have already.
GLOUCESTER
0
That was in thy rage.
ANNE
0
I would I knew thy heart.
GLOUCESTER
0
'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
ANNE
0
I fear me both are false.
GLOUCESTER
0
Then never was man true.
ANNE
0
well put up your sword.
GLOUCESTER
0
Say, then, my peace is made.
ANNE
0
That shalt thou know hereafter.
GLOUCESTER
0
But shall I live in hope?
ANNE
0
All men, I hope, live so.
GLOUCESTER
0
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
ANNE
0
To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
GLOUCESTER
0
Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
ANNE
0
What is it?
GLOUCESTER
0
That it may please you leave these sad designs
ANNE
0
With all my heart; and much it joys me too
GLOUCESTER
0
Bid me farewell.
ANNE
0
'Tis more than you deserve;
GLOUCESTER
0
Sirs, take up the corse.
GENTLEMEN
0
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
GLOUCESTER
0
No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.
RIVERS
0
Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
GREY
0
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
If he were dead, what would betide on
GREY
0
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
The loss of such a lord includes all
GREY
0
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Ah, he is young; and his minority
RIVER
0
Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
It is determin'd, not concluded yet;
GREY
0
Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
DERBY
0
God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord
DERBY
0
I do beseech you, either not believe
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of
DERBY
0
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
What likelihood of his amendment,
BUCKINGHAM
0
Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
God grant him health! Did you confer
BUCKINGHAM
0
Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Would all were well! But that will
GLOUCESTER
0
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
GREY
0
To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
GLOUCESTER
0
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
GLOUCESTER
0
I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Come, come, we know your meaning,
GLOUCESTER
0
Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
By Him that rais'd me to this careful
GLOUCESTER
0
You may deny that you were not the mean
RIVERS
0
She may, my lord; for-
GLOUCESTER
0
She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows
RIVERS
0
What, marry, may she?
GLOUCESTER
0
What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
QUEEN MARGARET
0
And less'ned be that small, God, I
GLOUCESTER
0
What! Threat you me with telling of the
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Out, devil! I do remember them to
GLOUCESTER
0
Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Ay, and much better blood than his or
GLOUCESTER
0
In all which time you and your husband Grey
QUEEN MARGARET
0
A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
GLOUCESTER
0
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Which God revenge!
GLOUCESTER
0
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
RIVERS
0
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
GLOUCESTER
0
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
QUEEN MARGARET
0
As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
GLOUCESTER
0
Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
QUEEN MARGARET
0
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
GLOUCESTER
0
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
I was; but I do find more pain in
GLOUCESTER
0
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
So just is God to right the innocent.
HASTINGS
0
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
RIVERS
0
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
DORSET
0
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
What, were you snarling all before I came,
GLOUCESTER
0
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
QUEEN MARGARET
0
And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou
GLOUCESTER
0
Margaret!
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Richard!
GLOUCESTER
0
Ha?
QUEEN MARGARET
0
I call thee not.
GLOUCESTER
0
I cry thee mercy then, for I did think
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
GLOUCESTER
0
'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Thus have you breath'd your curse
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
HASTINGS
0
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Foul shame upon you! you have all
RIVERS
0
Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your
QUEEN MARGARET
0
To serve me well you all should do me
DORSET
0
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;
GLOUCESTER
0
Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
DORSET
0
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
QUEEN MARGARET
0
And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
BUCKINGHAM
0
Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
QUEEN MARGARET
0
Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Have done, have done.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy
BUCKINGHAM
0
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
QUEEN MARGARET
0
I will not think but they ascend the sky
GLOUCESTER
0
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM
0
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
QUEEN MARGARET
0
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
BUCKINGHAM
0
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
RIVERS
0
And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
GLOUCESTER
0
I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
I never did her any to my knowledge.
GLOUCESTER
0
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
RIVERS
0
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
GLOUCESTER
0
So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis'd;
CATESBY
0
Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go
RIVERS
0
We wait upon your Grace.
GLOUCESTER
0
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
FIRST MURDERER
0
We are, my lord, and come to have the
GLOUCESTER
0
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
FIRST MURDERER
0
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
GLOUCESTER
0
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall
FIRST MURDERER
0
We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt
KEEPER
0
Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
CLARENCE
0
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
KEEPER
0
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
CLARENCE
0
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
KEEPER
0
Had you such leisure in the time of death
CLARENCE
0
Methought I had; and often did I strive
KEEPER
0
Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
CLARENCE
0
No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.
KEEPER
0
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
CLARENCE
0
Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
KEEPER
0
I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
BRAKENBURY
0
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
FIRST MURDERER
0
Ho! who's here?
BRAKENBURY
0
What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
FIRST MURDERER
0
I would speak with Clarence, and I came
BRAKENBURY
0
What, so brief?
SECOND MURDERER
0
'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
BRAKENBURY
0
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
FIRST MURDERER
0
You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
SECOND MURDERER
0
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
FIRST MURDERER
0
No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
SECOND MURDERER
0
Why, he shall never wake until the great
FIRST MURDERER
0
Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
SECOND MURDERER
0
The urging of that word judgment hath
FIRST MURDERER
0
What, art thou afraid?
SECOND MURDERER
0
Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
FIRST MURDERER
0
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
SECOND MURDERER
0
So I am, to let him live.
FIRST MURDERER
0
I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
SECOND MURDERER
0
Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
FIRST MURDERER
0
How dost thou feel thyself now?
FIRST MURDERER
0
Remember our reward, when the deed's
SECOND MURDERER
0
Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
FIRST MURDERER
0
Where's thy conscience now?
SECOND MURDERER
0
O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
FIRST MURDERER
0
When he opens his purse to give us our
SECOND MURDERER
0
'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
FIRST MURDERER
0
What if it come to thee again?
SECOND MURDERER
0
I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
FIRST MURDERER
0
Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
SECOND MURDERER
0
Take the devil in thy mind and believe
FIRST MURDERER
0
I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
SECOND MURDERER
0
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
FIRST MURDERER
0
Take him on the costard with the hilts of
SECOND MURDERER
0
O excellent device! and make a sop of
FIRST MURDERER
0
Soft! he wakes.
SECOND MURDERER
0
Strike!
FIRST MURDERER
0
No, we'll reason with him.
CLARENCE
0
Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
SECOND MURDERER
0
You shall have wine enough, my lord,
CLARENCE
0
In God's name, what art thou?
FIRST MURDERER
0
A man, as you are.
CLARENCE
0
But not as I am, royal.
SECOND MURDERER
0
Nor you as we are, loyal.
CLARENCE
0
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
FIRST MURDERER
0
My voice is now the King's, my looks
CLARENCE
0
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
SECOND MURDERER
0
To, to, to-
CLARENCE
0
To murder me?
BOTH MURDERERS
0
Ay, ay.
CLARENCE
0
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
FIRST MURDERER
0
Offended us you have not, but the King.
CLARENCE
0
I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
SECOND MURDERER
0
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
CLARENCE
0
Are you drawn forth among a world of men
FIRST MURDERER
0
What we will do, we do upon command.
SECOND MURDERER
0
And he that hath commanded is our
CLARENCE
0
Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
SECOND MURDERER
0
And that same vengeance doth he hurl
FIRST MURDERER
0
And like a traitor to the name of God
SECOND MURDERER
0
Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
FIRST MURDERER
0
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
CLARENCE
0
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
FIRST MURDERER
0
Who made thee then a bloody minister
CLARENCE
0
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
FIRST MURDERER
0
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
CLARENCE
0
If you do love my brother, hate not me;
SECOND MURDERER
0
You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
CLARENCE
0
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
FIRST MURDERER
0
Ay, so we will.
CLARENCE
0
Tell him when that our princely father York
FIRST MURDERER
0
Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
CLARENCE
0
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
FIRST MURDERER
0
Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
FIRST MURDERER
0
Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
SECOND MURDERER
0
Make peace with God, for you must die,
CLARENCE
0
Have you that holy feeling in your souls
SECOND MURDERER
0
What shall we do?
CLARENCE
0
Relent, and save your souls.
FIRST MURDERER
0
Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
CLARENCE
0
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
SECOND MURDERER
0
Look behind you, my lord.
FIRST MURDERER
0
 [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
SECOND MURDERER
0
A bloody deed, and desperately
SECOND MURDERER
0
A bloody deed, and desperately
    dispatch'd!
    How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
    Of this most grievous murder!
SECOND MURDERER
0
I would he knew that I had sav'd his
FIRST MURDERER
0
So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
KING EDWARD
0
Why, so. Now have I done a good day's
RIVERS
0
By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
HASTINGS
0
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
KING EDWARD
0
Take heed you dally not before your king;
HASTINGS
0
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
RIVERS
0
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
KING EDWARD
0
Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
There, Hastings; I will never more
KING EDWARD
0
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
DORSET
0
This interchange of love, I here protest,
HASTINGS
0
And so swear I.                       [They embrace]
KING EDWARD
0
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this
BUCKINGHAM
0
 [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham
KING EDWARD
0
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
BUCKINGHAM
0
And, in good time,
GLOUCESTER
0
Good morrow to my sovereign king and
KING EDWARD
0
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
GLOUCESTER
0
A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
KING EDWARD
0
Who knows not he is dead! Who knows
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
BUCKINGHAM
0
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
DORSET
0
Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
KING EDWARD
0
Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
GLOUCESTER
0
But he, poor man, by your first order died,
DERBY
0
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
KING EDWARD
0
I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
DERBY
0
I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
KING EDWARD
0
Then say at once what is it thou requests.
DERBY
0
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
KING EDWARD
0
Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
GLOUCESTER
0
This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
BUCKINGHAM
0
We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt
SON
0
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
DUCHESS
0
No, boy.
DAUGHTER
0
Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
SON
0
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
DUCHESS
0
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
SON
0
Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
DAUGHTER
0
And so will I.
DUCHESS
0
Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
SON
0
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
DUCHESS
0
Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
SON
0
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
DUCHESS
0
Ay, boy.
SON
0
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
DUCHESS
0
What means this scene of rude impatience?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
To make an act of tragic violence.
DUCHESS
0
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
SON
0
Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
DAUGHTER
0
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Give me no help in lamentation;
CHILDREN
0
Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
DUCHESS
0
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
What stay had I but Edward? and he's
CHILDREN
0
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
DUCHESS
0
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Was never widow had so dear a loss.
CHILDREN
0
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
DUCHESS
0
Was never mother had so dear a loss.
DORSET
0
Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
RIVERS
0
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
GLOUCESTER
0
Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
DUCHESS
0
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,
GLOUCESTER
0
Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old
BUCKINGHAM
0
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing
BUCKINGHAM
0
Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
GLOUCESTER
0
I hope the King made peace with all of us;
RIVERS
0
And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
HASTINGS
0
And so say I.
GLOUCESTER
0
Then be it so; and go we to determine
BUCKINGHAM
0
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
GLOUCESTER
0
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
SECOND CITIZEN
0
I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Yes, that the King is dead.

Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!

ARCHBISHOP
0
Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
DUCHESS
0
I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
But I hear no; they say my son of York
YORK
0
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
DUCHESS
0
Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
YORK
0
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
DUCHESS
0
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
ARCHBISHOP
0
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
DUCHESS
0
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
YORK
0
Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
DUCHESS
0
How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
YORK
0
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
DUCHESS
0
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
YORK
0
Grandam, his nurse.
DUCHESS
0
His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
YORK
0
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
ARCHBISHOP
0
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Pitchers have ears.
ARCHBISHOP
0
Here comes a messenger. What news?
MESSENGER
0
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
How doth the Prince?
MESSENGER
0
Well, madam, and in health.
DUCHESS
0
What is thy news?
MESSENGER
0
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
DUCHESS
0
Who hath committed them?
MESSENGER
0
The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
ARCHBISHOP
0
For what offence?
MESSENGER
0
The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
0
Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
DUCHESS
0
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,

Come, come, my boy; we will to

Stay, I will go with you.

You have no cause.

 [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your

0
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
PRINCE
0
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way

Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your

God keep me from false friends! but they were

My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet

God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
PRINCE
0
I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
BUCKINGHAM
0
And, in good time, here comes the sweating
PRINCE
0
Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
HASTINGS
0
On what occasion, God He knows, not I,
BUCKINGHAM
0
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
CARDINAL
0
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
BUCKINGHAM
0
You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
CARDINAL
0
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.
HASTINGS
0
I go, my lord.
PRINCE
0
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
GLOUCESTER
0
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
PRINCE
0
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
BUCKINGHAM
0
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
PRINCE
0
Is it upon record, or else reported
BUCKINGHAM
0
Upon record, my gracious lord.
PRINCE
0
But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,
GLOUCESTER
0
 [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
PRINCE
0
What say you, uncle?
GLOUCESTER
0
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
PRINCE
0
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;

What, my gracious lord?
PRINCE
0
An if I live until I be a man,
GLOUCESTER
0
 [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward
BUCKINGHAM
0
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of
PRINCE
0
Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
YORK
0
Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.
PRINCE
0
Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
GLOUCESTER
0
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
YORK
0
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
GLOUCESTER
0
He hath, my lord.
YORK
0
And therefore is he idle?
GLOUCESTER
0
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
YORK
0
Then he is more beholding to you than I.
GLOUCESTER
0
He may command me as my sovereign;
YORK
0
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
GLOUCESTER
0
My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!
PRINCE
0
A beggar, brother?
YORK
0
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
GLOUCESTER
0
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
YORK
0
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!
GLOUCESTER
0
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
YORK
0
O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:
GLOUCESTER
0
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
YORK
0
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
GLOUCESTER
0
What, would you have my weapon, little
YORK
0
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
GLOUCESTER
0
How?
YORK
0
Little.
PRINCE
0
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
YORK
0
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
BUCKINGHAM
0
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
GLOUCESTER
0
My lord, will't please you pass along?
YORK
0
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
PRINCE
0
My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
YORK
0
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
GLOUCESTER
0
Why, what should you fear?
YORK
0
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
PRINCE
0
I fear no uncles dead.
GLOUCESTER
0
Nor none that live, I hope.
PRINCE
0
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
GLOUCESTER
0
No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;
BUCKINGHAM
0
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
CATESBY
0
He for his father's sake so loves the Prince
BUCKINGHAM
0
What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will
CATESBY
0
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Well then, no more but this: go, gentle
GLOUCESTER
0
Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,
BUCKINGHAM
0
Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
CATESBY
0
My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
GLOUCESTER
0
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
CATESBY
0
You shall, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
0
At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
GLOUCESTER
0
Chop off his head-something we will
BUCKINGHAM
0
I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
GLOUCESTER
0
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
MESSENGER
0
My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
HASTINGS
0
 [Within]  Who knocks?
MESSENGER
0
One from the Lord Stanley.
HASTINGS
0
 [Within]  What is't o'clock?
MESSENGER
0
Upon the stroke of four.
HASTINGS
0
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
MESSENGER
0
So it appears by that I have to say.
HASTINGS
0
What then?
MESSENGER
0
Then certifies your lordship that this night
HASTINGS
0
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
MESSENGER
0
I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
CATESBY
0
Many good morrows to my noble lord!
HASTINGS
0
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
CATESBY
0
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;
HASTINGS
0
How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the
CATESBY
0
Ay, my good lord.
HASTINGS
0
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my
CATESBY
0
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
HASTINGS
0
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
CATESBY
0
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
HASTINGS
0
But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
CATESBY
0
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
HASTINGS
0
O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
CATESBY
0
The Princes both make high account of you-
HASTINGS
0
I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.
STANLEY
0
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.
HASTINGS
0
My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,
STANLEY
0
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from
HASTINGS
0
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my
STANLEY
0
They, for their truth, might better wear their
HASTINGS
0
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
PURSUIVANT
0
The better that your lordship please to ask.
HASTINGS
0
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
PURSUIVANT
0
God hold it, to your honour's good content!
HASTINGS
0
Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.
PURSUIVANT
0
I thank your honour.                          Exit
PRIEST
0
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
HASTINGS
0
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
PRIEST
0
I'll wait upon your lordship.
BUCKINGHAM
0
What, talking with a priest, Lord
HASTINGS
0
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
BUCKINGHAM
0
I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;
HASTINGS
0
Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
BUCKINGHAM
0
 [Aside]  And supper too, although thou

I'll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt

Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
GREY
0
God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
VAUGHAN
0
You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
RATCLIFF
0
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
RIVERS
0
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
GREY
0
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
RIVERS
0
Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she
RATCLIFF
0
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
RIVERS
0
Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
HASTINGS
0
Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
BUCKINGHAM
0
Is all things ready for the royal time?
DERBY
0
It is, and wants but nomination.
BISHOP OF ELY
0
To-morrow then I judge a happy day.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Who knows the Lord Protector's mind
BISHOP OF ELY
0
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know
BUCKINGHAM
0
We know each other's faces; for our hearts,
HASTINGS
0
I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
BISHOP OF ELY
0
In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
GLOUCESTER
0
My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
GLOUCESTER
0
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
GLOUCESTER
0
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.
DERBY
0
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
DERBY
0
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
    To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
    For I myself am not so well provided
    As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
BISHOP OF ELY
0
Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
HASTINGS
0
His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
DERBY
0
What of his heart perceive you in his face
HASTINGS
0
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
HASTINGS
1
GLOUCESTER
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
    For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
HASTINGS
1
GLOUCESTER
The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
HASTINGS
1
GLOUCESTER
If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.
    Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear
    I will not dine until I see the same.
    Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.
    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
                    Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF
HASTINGS
1
GLOUCESTER
Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;
RATCLIFF

GLOUCESTER
Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at
HASTINGS
1
GLOUCESTER
O momentary grace of mortal men,
LOVEL
1
GLOUCESTER
Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
HASTINGS
1
GLOUCESTER
O bloody Richard! Miserable England!
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Lord Mayor-
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Look to the drawbridge there!
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Hark! a drum.
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
God and our innocence defend and guard us!
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.
LOVEL
1
GLOUCESTER
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red
MAYOR
1
GLOUCESTER
Had he done so?
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
MAYOR
1
GLOUCESTER
Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Yet had we not determin'd he should die
MAYOR
1
GLOUCESTER
But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Which since you come too late of our intent,
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Which since you come too late of our intent,
    Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
    And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
                                                 Exit LORD MAYOR
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's
BUCKINGHAM
1
GLOUCESTER
I go; and towards three or four o'clock
GLOUCESTER
1
GLOUCESTER
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.

Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
GLOUCESTER
0
How now, how now! What say the citizens?
BUCKINGHAM
0
Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,

Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's
BUCKINGHAM

I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,

And did they so?
BUCKINGHAM

No, so God help me, they spake not a word;

What, tongueless blocks were they? Would
BUCKINGHAM

Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor
CATESBY
0
He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
BUCKINGHAM

Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;
CATESBY

I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit
BUCKINGHAM

Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
MAYOR

Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
BUCKINGHAM

CATESBY
I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.
CATESBY

CATESBY
My lord,
BUCKINGHAM
1
CATESBY
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
MAYOR
0
See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
BUCKINGHAM
0
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
GLOUCESTER
0
My lord, there needs no such apology:
BUCKINGHAM
0
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
GLOUCESTER
0
I do suspect I have done some offence
BUCKINGHAM
0
You have, my lord. Would it might please
GLOUCESTER
0
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
BUCKINGHAM
0
Know then, it is your fault that you resign
GLOUCESTER
0
I cannot tell if to depart in silence
BUCKINGHAM
0
My lord, this argues conscience in your
MAYOR
0
Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
BUCKINGHAM
0
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
CATESBY
0
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
GLOUCESTER
0
Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
BUCKINGHAM
0
If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,
GLOUCESTER
0
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
CATESBY
0
Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.
GLOUCESTER
0
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
GLOUCESTER
1
BUCKINGHAM
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
    Call them again. I am not made of stones,
    But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
    Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
MAYOR
1
BUCKINGHAM
God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
GLOUCESTER
1
BUCKINGHAM
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
BUCKINGHAM

Then I salute you with this royal title-
ALL

Amen.

To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?

    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;

    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.

BUCKINGHAM

Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad
    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
    I will take order for her keeping close.
    Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
    Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-
    The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
    Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
    That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
    About it; for it stands me much upon
    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
    I must be married to my brother's daughter,
    Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
    Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
    Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
    So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
    Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

    Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
    Richard except, those whom we fight against
    Had rather have us win than him they follow.
    For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
    A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
    One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
    One that made means to come by what he hath,
    And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
    A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
    Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
    One that hath ever been God's enemy.
    Then if you fight against God's enemy,
    God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
    If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
    You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
    If you do fight against your country's foes,
    Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire;
    If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
    Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
    If you do free your children from the sword,
    Your children's children quits it in your age.
    Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
    Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
    For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
    Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
    But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
    The least of you shall share his part thereof.
    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
    God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt
