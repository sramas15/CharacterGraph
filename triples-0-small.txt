In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

HELENA
LAFEU
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;
but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in
ward, evermore in subjection.

BERTRAM
HELENA
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
abundance.

What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?

LAFEU

BERTRAM
HELENA
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.

This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature
immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of
the King's disease.

How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?

COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON

BERTRAM
HELENA
LAFEU
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.

BERTRAM
HELENA
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.

What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?

A fistula, my lord.

HELENA

COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
I heard not of it before.

BERTRAM
HELENA
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON

BERTRAM
HELENA
LAFEU
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives
her honesty, and achieves her goodness.

BERTRAM
HELENA
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
you affect a sorrow than to have-

HELENA

BERTRAM
LAFEU
COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
grief the enemy to the living.

COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON

BERTRAM
HELENA

If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
soon mortal.

Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.

That shall attend his love.

The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your
mistress, and make much of her.
