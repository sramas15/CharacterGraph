Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.
FIRST COMMONER
0
Why, sir, a carpenter.
MARULLUS
0
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
SECOND COMMONER
0
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
MARULLUS
0
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
SECOND COMMONER
0
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
MARULLUS
0
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
SECOND COMMONER
0
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,
MARULLUS
0
What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
SECOND COMMONER
0
Why, sir, cobble you.
FLAVIUS
0
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
SECOND COMMONER
0
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I
FLAVIUS
0
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
SECOND COMMONER
0
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself
MARULLUS
0
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
FLAVIUS
0
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
MARULLUS
0
May we do so?
FLAVIUS

It is no matter; let no images
CAESAR
0
Calpurnia!
CASCA
0
Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
CAESAR
0
Calpurnia!
CALPURNIA
0
Here, my lord.
CAESAR
0
Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
ANTONY
0
Caesar, my lord?
CAESAR
0
Forget not in your speed, Antonio,
ANTONY
0
I shall remember.
CAESAR
0
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.           Flourish.
SOOTHSAYER
0
Caesar!
CAESAR
0
Ha! Who calls?
CASCA
0
Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!
CAESAR
0
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
SOOTHSAYER
0
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR
0
What man is that?
BRUTUS
0
A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.
CAESAR
0
Set him before me let me see his face.
CASSIUS
0
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
CAESAR
0
What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.
SOOTHSAYER
0
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR
0
He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.
CASSIUS
0
Will you go see the order of the course?
BRUTUS
0
Not I.
CASSIUS
0
I pray you, do.
BRUTUS
0
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
CASSIUS
0
Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
BRUTUS
0
Cassius,
CASSIUS
0
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
BRUTUS
0
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
CASSIUS
0
'Tis just,
BRUTUS
0
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
CASSIUS
0
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
BRUTUS
0
What means this shouting? I do fear the people
CASSIUS
0
Ay, do you fear it?
BRUTUS
0
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
CASSIUS
0
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
BRUTUS
0
Another general shout!
CASSIUS
0
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
BRUTUS
0
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
CASSIUS
0
I am glad that my weak words
CASSIUS
1
CAESAR
I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
BRUTUS
1
CAESAR
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
CASSIUS
1
CAESAR
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
BRUTUS
1
CAESAR
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
CASSIUS
1
CAESAR
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CAESAR
1
CAESAR
Antonio!
ANTONY
1
CAESAR
Caesar?
CAESAR
1
CAESAR
Let me have men about me that are fat,
ANTONY
1
CAESAR
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
CAESAR
1
CAESAR
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
CASCA
0
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
BRUTUS
0
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
CASCA
0
Why, you were with him, were you not?
BRUTUS
0
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
CASCA
0
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
BRUTUS
0
What was the second noise for?
CASCA
0
Why, for that too.
CASSIUS
0
They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
CASCA
0
Why, for that too.
BRUTUS
0
Was the crown offered him thrice?
CASCA
0
Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
CASSIUS
0
Who offered him the crown?
CASCA
0
Why, Antony.
BRUTUS
0
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
CASCA
0
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
CASSIUS
0
But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
CASCA
0
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
BRUTUS
0
'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
CASSIUS
0
No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
CASCA
0
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
BRUTUS
0
What said he when he came unto himself?
CASCA
0
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
BRUTUS
0
And after that he came, thus sad, away?
CASCA
0
Ay.
CASSIUS
0
Did Cicero say anything?
CASCA
0
Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASSIUS
0
To what effect?
CASCA
0
Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
CASSIUS
0
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
CASCA
0
No, I am promised forth.
CASSIUS
0
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
CASCA
0
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
CASSIUS
0
Good, I will expect you.
CASCA
0
Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
BRUTUS
0
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
CASSIUS
0
So is he now in execution
BRUTUS
0
And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
CASSIUS
0
I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
CICERO
0
Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
CASCA
0
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
CICERO
0
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
CASCA
0
A common slave- you know him well by sight-
CICERO
0
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
CASCA
0
He doth, for he did bid Antonio
CICERO
0
Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
CASCA
0
Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
CASSIUS
0
Who's there?
CASCA
0
A Roman.
CASSIUS
0
Casca, by your voice.
CASCA
0
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
CASSIUS
0
A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA
0
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASSIUS
0
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
CASCA
0
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
CASSIUS
0
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
CASCA
0
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
CASSIUS
0
Let it be who it is, for Romans now
CASCA
0
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
CASSIUS
0
I know where I will wear this dagger then:
CASCA
0
So can I.
CASSIUS
0
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
CASCA
0
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
CASSIUS
0
There's a bargain made.
CASCA
0
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASSIUS
0
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
CINNA
0
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
CASSIUS
0
No, it is Casca, one incorporate
CINNA
0
I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
CASSIUS
0
Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
CINNA
0
Yes, you are.
CASSIUS
0
Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
CINNA
0
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
CASSIUS
0
That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
CASCA
0
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
CASSIUS
0
Him and his worth and our great need of him
BRUTUS
0
What, Lucius, ho!
LUCIUS
0
Call'd you, my lord?
BRUTUS
0
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
LUCIUS
0
I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
BRUTUS
0
It must be by his death, and, for my part,
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Get you to bed again, it is not day.
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
I know not, sir.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
LUCIUS
0
I will, sir.                                     Exit.
BRUTUS
0
The exhalations whizzing in the air
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Is he alone?
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
No, sir, there are more with him.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Do you know them?
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
BRUTUS
0
Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
CASSIUS
0
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
BRUTUS
0
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
CASSIUS
0
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
BRUTUS
0
He is welcome hither.
CASSIUS
0
This, Decius Brutus.
BRUTUS
0
He is welcome too.
BRUTUS
0
They are all welcome.
CASSIUS
0
Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
DECIUS
0
Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
CASCA
0
No.
CINNA
0
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
CASCA
0
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
BRUTUS
0
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
CASSIUS
0
And let us swear our resolution.
BRUTUS
0
No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
CASSIUS
0
But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
CASCA
0
Let us not leave him out.
CINNA
0
No, by no means.
METELLUS
0
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
BRUTUS
0
O, name him not; let us not break with him,
CASSIUS
0
Then leave him out.
CASCA
0
Indeed he is not fit.
DECIUS
0
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
CASSIUS
0
Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
BRUTUS
0
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
CASSIUS
0
Yet I fear him,
BRUTUS
0
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
TREBONIUS
0
There is no fear in him-let him not die,
BRUTUS
0
Peace, count the clock.
CASSIUS
0
The clock hath stricken three.
TREBONIUS
0
'Tis time to part.
CASSIUS
0
But it is doubtful yet
DECIUS
0
Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
CASSIUS
0
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
BRUTUS
0
By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
CINNA
0
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
METELLUS
0
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
BRUTUS
0
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
CASSIUS
0
The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
BRUTUS
0
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
PORTIA
0
Brutus, my lord!
BRUTUS
0
Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
PORTIA
0
Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
BRUTUS
0
I am not well in health, and that is all.
PORTIA
0
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
BRUTUS
0
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
PORTIA
0
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
BRUTUS
0
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
PORTIA
0
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
BRUTUS
0
You are my true and honorable wife,
PORTIA
0
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
BRUTUS
0
O ye gods,
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
LUCIUS
1
LUCIUS
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
LIGARIUS
1
LUCIUS
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
LIGARIUS
1
LUCIUS
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
LIGARIUS
1
LUCIUS
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
LIGARIUS
1
LUCIUS
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
LIGARIUS
1
LUCIUS
Set on your foot,
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Follow me then.                                Exeunt.
CAESAR
0
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
SERVANT
0
My lord?
CAESAR
0
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
SERVANT
0
I will, my lord.                                Exit.
CALPURNIA
0
What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
CAESAR
0
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
CALPURNIA
0
Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
CAESAR
0
What can be avoided
CALPURNIA
0
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
CAESAR
0
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
SERVANT
1
SERVANT
They would not have you to stir forth today.
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
CALPURNIA
1
SERVANT
Alas, my lord,
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
DECIUS
1
SERVANT
Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
And you are come in very happy time
CALPURNIA
1
SERVANT
Say he is sick.
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Shall Caesar send a lie?
DECIUS
1
SERVANT
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
The cause is in my will: I will not come,
DECIUS
1
SERVANT
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
And this way have you well expounded it.
DECIUS
1
SERVANT
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
PUBLIUS
1
SERVANT
Good morrow,Caesar.
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Welcome, Publius.
BRUTUS
1
SERVANT
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
ANTONY
1
SERVANT
So to most noble Caesar.
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Bid them prepare within.
TREBONIUS
1
SERVANT
Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be
CAESAR
1
SERVANT
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,
BRUTUS
1
SERVANT
[Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,

"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come
PORTIA

I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;
LUCIUS

To know my errand, madam.
PORTIA

I would have had thee there, and here again,
LUCIUS
0
Madam, what should I do?
PORTIA
0
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
LUCIUS

I hear none, madam.
PORTIA
0
Prithee, listen well.
LUCIUS
0
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
PORTIA
0
Come hither, fellow;
SOOTHSAYER
0
At mine own house, good lady.
PORTIA
0
What is't o'clock?
SOOTHSAYER
0
About the ninth hour, lady.
PORTIA
0
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
SOOTHSAYER
0
Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand
PORTIA
0
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
SOOTHSAYER
0
That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar
PORTIA
0
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
SOOTHSAYER
0
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
PORTIA
0
I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
CAESAR
0
The ides of March are come.
SOOTHSAYER
0
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
DECIUS
0
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read,
ARTEMIDORUS
0
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit
CAESAR
0
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
ARTEMIDORUS
0
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
CAESAR
0
What, is the fellow mad?
PUBLIUS
0
Sirrah, give place.
CASSIUS
0
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
POPILIUS
0
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
CASSIUS
0
What enterprise, Popilius?
POPILIUS
0
Fare you well.
BRUTUS
0
What said Popilius Lena?
CASSIUS
0
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.
BRUTUS
0
Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.
CASSIUS
0
Casca,
BRUTUS
0
Cassius, be constant.
CASSIUS
0
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,
DECIUS
0
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him
BRUTUS
0
He is address'd; press near and second him.
CINNA
0
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
CAESAR
0
Are we all ready? What is now amiss
METELLUS
0
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
CAESAR
0
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
METELLUS
0
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,
BRUTUS
0
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,
CAESAR
0
What, Brutus?
CASSIUS
0
Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!
CAESAR

I could be well moved, if I were as you;

O Caesar-
CAESAR

Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?

Great Caesar-

Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

0
Speak, hands, for me!
CAESAR
0
Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.
CINNA
0
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
CASSIUS
0
Some to the common pulpits and cry out
BRUTUS
0
People and senators, be not affrighted,
CASCA
0
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
DECIUS
0
And Cassius too.
BRUTUS
0
Where's Publius?
CINNA
0
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
METELLUS
0
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
BRUTUS
0
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,
CASSIUS
0
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people
BRUTUS

Do so, and let no man abide this deed

Do so, and let no man abide this deed

Fates, we will know your pleasures.

TREBONIUS
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
BRUTUS

TREBONIUS
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;

Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence

How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,

So oft as that shall be,
DECIUS
1
TREBONIUS
What, shall we forth?
CASSIUS
1
TREBONIUS
Ay, every man away.
BRUTUS
1
TREBONIUS
Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
SERVANT
1
TREBONIUS
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,
BRUTUS
1
TREBONIUS
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
SERVANT
1
TREBONIUS
I'll fetch him presently.                       Exit.
BRUTUS
1
TREBONIUS
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
CASSIUS
1
TREBONIUS
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
    That fears him much, and my misgiving still
    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
ANTONY
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
O Antony, beg not your death of us!
CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Only be patient till we have appeased
ANTONY
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
I doubt not of your wisdom.
CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Mark Antony-
ANTONY
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
ANTONY
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Or else were this a savage spectacle.
ANTONY
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
That's all I seek;
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
You shall, Mark Antony.
CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Brutus, a word with you.
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
By your pardon,
CASSIUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
ANTONY
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Be it so,
BRUTUS
2
TREBONIUS
ANTONY
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
BRUTUS
1
TREBONIUS
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
                                          Exeunt all but Antony.
ANTONY
1
TREBONIUS
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
SERVANT
1
TREBONIUS
I do, Mark Antony.
ANTONY
1
TREBONIUS
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
SERVANT
1
TREBONIUS
He did receive his letters, and is coming,
ANTONY
1
TREBONIUS
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
SERVANT
1
TREBONIUS
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
ANTONY
1
TREBONIUS
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY
1
TREBONIUS
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
    Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
    No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
    Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,
    Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
    Into the marketplace. There shall I try,
    In my oration, how the people take
    The cruel issue of these bloody men,
    According to the which thou shalt discourse
    To young Octavius of the state of things.
    Lend me your hand.                Exeunt with Caesar's body.
CITIZENS

We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!
BRUTUS

Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
FIRST CITIZEN

I will hear Brutus speak.
SECOND CITIZEN

I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,
THIRD CITIZEN

The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
BRUTUS

Be patient till the last.
ALL

None, Brutus, none.

Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar

Live, Brutus, live, live!

Bring him with triumph home unto his house.

Give him a statue with his ancestors.

Let him be Caesar.

Caesar's better parts
FIRST CITIZEN
0
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and
BRUTUS
0
My countrymen-
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Peace, ho!
BRUTUS
0
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Let him go up into the public chair;
ANTONY
0
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
What does he say of Brutus?
THIRD CITIZEN
0
He says, for Brutus' sake,
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
This Caesar was a tyrant.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Nay, that's certain.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.
ANTONY
0
You gentle Romans-
ALL
0
Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
ANTONY
0
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Has he, masters?
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
FIRST CITIZEN
0
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
ANTONY
0
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
ALL
0
The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
ANTONY
0
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
ANTONY
0
Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
They were traitors. Honorable men!
ALL
0
The will! The testament!
SECOND CITIZEN
0
They were villains, murtherers. The will!
ANTONY
0
You will compel me then to read the will?
ALL
0
Come down.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Descend.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
You shall have leave.
FOURTH CITIZEN

A ring, stand round.

Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.

Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
ANTONY

Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
ALL

Stand back; room, bear back!
ANTONY

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

O piteous spectacle!

O noble Caesar!

O woeful day!
FOURTH CITIZEN

O traitors villains!
FIRST CITIZEN

O most bloody sight!

We will be revenged.
ALL

Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!
ANTONY
0
Stay, countrymen.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with
ANTONY
0
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ALL
0
We'll mutiny.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.
ANTONY
0
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ALL
0
Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
ANTONY
0
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ALL

Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.
ANTONY
0
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
O royal Caesar!
ANTONY
0
Hear me with patience.
ALL
0
Peace, ho!
ANTONY
0
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Never, never. Come, away, away!
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Go fetch fire.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Pluck down benches.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
ANTONY
0
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
SERVANT
0
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
ANTONY
0
Where is he?
SERVANT
0
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
ANTONY
0
And thither will I straight to visit him.
SERVANT
0
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
ANTONY
0
Be like they had some notice of the people,
CINNA
0
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
FIRST CITIZEN
0
What is your name?
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Whither are you going?
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Where do you dwell?
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
SECOND CITIZEN
0
Answer every man directly.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Ay, and briefly.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Ay, and wisely.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Ay, and truly, you were best.
CINNA
0
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I
SECOND CITIZEN
0
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.
CINNA
0
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
As a friend or an enemy?
CINNA
0
As a friend.
SECOND CITIZEN
0
That matter is answered directly.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
For your dwelling, briefly.
CINNA
0
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Your name, sir, truly.
CINNA
0
Truly, my name is Cinna.
FIRST CITIZEN
0
Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
CINNA
0
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad
CINNA
0
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
FOURTH CITIZEN
0
It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but his
THIRD CITIZEN
0
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho, firebrands. To
ANTONY
0
These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
OCTAVIUS
0
Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
LEPIDUS
0
I do consent-
OCTAVIUS
0
Prick him down, Antony.
LEPIDUS
0
Upon condition Publius shall not live,
ANTONY
0
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
LEPIDUS
0
What, shall I find you here?
OCTAVIUS
0
Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.
ANTONY
0
This is a slight unmeritable man,
OCTAVIUS
0
So you thought him,
ANTONY
0
Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
OCTAVIUS
0
You may do your will,
ANTONY
0
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
OCTAVIUS
0
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
BRUTUS
0
Stand, ho!
LUCILIUS
0
Give the word, ho, and stand.
BRUTUS
0
What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
LUCILIUS
0
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
BRUTUS
0
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
PINDARUS
0
I do not doubt
BRUTUS
0
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
LUCILIUS
0
With courtesy and with respect enough,
BRUTUS
0
Thou hast described
LUCILIUS
0
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;
BRUTUS
0
Hark, he is arrived.
CASSIUS
0
Stand, ho!
BRUTUS
0
Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
FIRST SOLDIER
0
Stand!
SECOND SOLDIER
0
Stand!
THIRD SOLDIER
0
Stand!
CASSIUS
0
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
BRUTUS
0
Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
CASSIUS
0
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
BRUTUS
0
Cassius, be content,
CASSIUS
0
Pindarus,
BRUTUS
0
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man
CASSIUS
0
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
BRUTUS
0
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
CASSIUS
0
In such a time as this it is not meet
BRUTUS
0
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
CASSIUS
0
I an itching palm?
BRUTUS
0
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
CASSIUS
0
Chastisement?
BRUTUS
0
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
CASSIUS
0
Brutus, bait not me,
BRUTUS
0
Go to, you are not, Cassius.
CASSIUS
0
I am.
BRUTUS
0
I say you are not.
CASSIUS
0
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
BRUTUS
0
Away, slight man!
CASSIUS
0
Is't possible?
BRUTUS
0
Hear me, for I will speak.
CASSIUS
0
O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
BRUTUS
0
All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
CASSIUS
0
Is it come to this?
BRUTUS
0
You say you are a better soldier:
CASSIUS
0
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
BRUTUS
0
If you did, I care not.
CASSIUS
0
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
BRUTUS
0
Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
CASSIUS
0
I durst not?
BRUTUS
0
No.
CASSIUS
0
What, durst not tempt him?
BRUTUS
0
For your life you durst not.
CASSIUS
0
Do not presume too much upon my love;
BRUTUS
0
You have done that you should be sorry for.
CASSIUS
0
I denied you not.
BRUTUS
0
You did.
CASSIUS
0
I did not. He was but a fool
BRUTUS
0
I do not, till you practise them on me.
CASSIUS
0
You love me not.
BRUTUS
0
I do not like your faults.
CASSIUS
0
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
BRUTUS
0
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
CASSIUS
0
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
BRUTUS
0
Sheathe your dagger.
CASSIUS
0
Hath Cassius lived
BRUTUS
0
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
CASSIUS
0
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
BRUTUS
0
And my heart too.
CASSIUS
0
O Brutus!
BRUTUS
0
What's the matter?
CASSIUS
0
Have not you love enough to bear with me
BRUTUS
0
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
POET
0
[Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
LUCILIUS
0
[Within.] You shall not come to them.
POET
0
[Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
CASSIUS
0
How now, what's the matter?
POET
0
For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
CASSIUS
0
Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
BRUTUS
0
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
CASSIUS
0
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
BRUTUS
0
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
CASSIUS
0
Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
BRUTUS
0
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
CASSIUS
0
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
BRUTUS
0
Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
CASSIUS
0
I did not think you could have been so angry.
BRUTUS
0
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
CASSIUS
0
Of your philosophy you make no use,
BRUTUS
0
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
CASSIUS
0
Ha? Portia?
BRUTUS
0
She is dead.
CASSIUS
0
How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
BRUTUS
0
Impatient of my absence,
CASSIUS
0
And died so?
BRUTUS
0
Even so.
CASSIUS
1
LUCIUS
O ye immortal gods!
BRUTUS
1
LUCIUS
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
CASSIUS
1
LUCIUS
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
Portia, art thou gone?
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
No more, I pray you.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
With what addition?
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
There in our letters do not well agree;
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
Cicero one!
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Cicero is dead,
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
No, Messala.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Nothing, Messala.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
That, methinks, is strange.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
No, my lord.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Even so great men great losses should endure.
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
I have as much of this in art as you,
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Well, to our work alive. What do you think
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
I do not think it good.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Your reason?
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
This it is:
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
Hear me, good brother.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Under your pardon. You must note beside
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
Then, with your will, go on;
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
No more. Good night.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Lucius!
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Lucius!
    My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
O my dear brother!
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Everything is well.
CASSIUS
1
TITINIUS
Good night, my lord.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Good night, good brother.
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
BRUTUS
1
TITINIUS
Farewell, everyone.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Farewell, everyone.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Here in the tent.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Varro and Claudio!
VARRO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Calls my lord?
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
VARRO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
It does, my boy.
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
It is my duty, sir.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
I have slept, my lord, already.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
GHOST
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Why comest thou?
GHOST
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Well, then I shall see thee again?
GHOST
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Ay, at Philippi.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
The strings, my lord, are false.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
My lord?
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
LUCIUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Nothing, my lord.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
VARRO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
My lord?
CLAUDIO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
My lord?
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
VARRO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Ay, saw you anything?
VARRO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
CLAUDIO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Nor I, my lord.
BRUTUS
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
VARRO
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.
OCTAVIUS
0
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
ANTONY
0
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
MESSENGER
0
Prepare you, generals.
ANTONY
0
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
OCTAVIUS
0
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
ANTONY
0
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
OCTAVIUS
0
I do not cross you, but I will do so.
BRUTUS
0
They stand, and would have parley.
CASSIUS
0
Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
OCTAVIUS
0
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
ANTONY
0
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
OCTAVIUS
0
Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
BRUTUS
0
Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
OCTAVIUS
0
Not that we love words better, as you do.
BRUTUS
0
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
ANTONY
0
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
CASSIUS
0
Antony,
ANTONY
0
Not stingless too.
BRUTUS
0
O, yes, and soundless too,
ANTONY
0
Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
CASSIUS
0
Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
OCTAVIUS
0
Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
BRUTUS
0
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
OCTAVIUS
0
So I hope,
BRUTUS
0
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
CASSIUS
0
A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
ANTONY
0
Old Cassius still!
OCTAVIUS
0
Come, Antony, away!
CASSIUS
0
Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
BRUTUS
0
Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
LUCILIUS
0
[Stands forth.] My lord?
CASSIUS
0
Messala!
MESSALA
0
[Stands forth.] What says my general?
CASSIUS
0
Messala,
MESSALA
0
Believe not so.
CASSIUS
0
I but believe it partly,
BRUTUS
0
Even so, Lucilius.
CASSIUS
0
Now, most noble Brutus,
BRUTUS
0
Even by the rule of that philosophy
CASSIUS
0
Then, if we lose this battle,
BRUTUS
0
No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
CASSIUS
0
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
BRUTUS
0
Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
BRUTUS
0
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
CASSIUS
0
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
TITINIUS
0
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
PINDARUS
0
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
CASSIUS
0
This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
TITINIUS
0
They are, my lord.
CASSIUS
0
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
TITINIUS
0
I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
CASSIUS
0
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
PINDARUS
0
[Above.] O my lord!
CASSIUS
0
What news?
PINDARUS
0
[Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
CASSIUS
0
Come down; behold no more.
PINDARUS
0
So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
PINDARUS
1
TITINIUS
So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Where did you leave him?
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
All disconsolate,
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
He lies not like the living. O my heart!
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Is not that he?
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
No, this was he, Messala,
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
MESSALA
1
TITINIUS
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
TITINIUS
1
TITINIUS
Hie you, Messala,
TITINIUS
1
MESSALA
Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
MESSALA
1
MESSALA
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
Titinius' face is upward.
CATO
1
MESSALA
He is slain.
BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
CATO
1
MESSALA
Brave Titinius!
BRUTUS
1
MESSALA
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
BRUTUS
0
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
CATO
0
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
BRUTUS
0
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
LUCILIUS
0
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
FIRST SOLDIER
0
Yield, or thou diest.
LUCILIUS
0
Only I yield to die.
FIRST SOLDIER
0
We must not. A noble prisoner!
SECOND SOLDIER
0
Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
FIRST SOLDIER
0
I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
ANTONY
0
Where is he?
LUCILIUS
0
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
ANTONY
0
This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
BRUTUS
0
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
CLITUS
0
Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
BRUTUS
0
Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
CLITUS
0
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
BRUTUS
0
Peace then, no words.
CLITUS
0
I'll rather kill myself.
BRUTUS
0
Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
DARDANIUS
0
Shall I do such a deed?
CLITUS
0
O Dardanius!
DARDANIUS
0
O Clitus!
CLITUS
0
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
DARDANIUS
0
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
CLITUS
0
Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
BRUTUS
0
Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
VOLUMNIUS
0
What says my lord?
BRUTUS
0
Why, this, Volumnius:
VOLUMNIUS
0
Not so, my lord.
BRUTUS
0
Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
VOLUMNIUS
0
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
CLITUS
0
Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
BRUTUS
0
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
CLITUS
0
Fly, my lord, fly.
BRUTUS
0
Hence! I will follow.
STRATO
0
Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
BRUTUS
0
Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
OCTAVIUS
0
What man is that?
MESSALA
0
My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
STRATO
0
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
LUCILIUS
0
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
OCTAVIUS
0
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
STRATO
0
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
OCTAVIUS
0
Do so, good Messala.
MESSALA
0
How died my master, Strato?
STRATO
0
I held the sword, and he did run on it.
MESSALA
0
Octavius, then take him to follow thee
ANTONY
0
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
OCTAVIUS
0
According to his virtue let us use him
