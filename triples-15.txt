1
Caesar
UTUS. Not I.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I pray you, do.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
1
Caesar
ESAR. Antonio!
  ANTONY. 
1
Caesar
TONY. Caesar?
  CAESAR. 
1
Caesar
ESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,
  ANTONY. 
1
Caesar
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
1
Caesar
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
                                                     Exit Cinna.
  CASCA.

  CASSIUS.

Cassius
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him

  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.

Brutus
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.

                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
2

Lucius
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS.

Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS.

Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS.

Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS.

Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius

    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,

    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.

SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,

Lucius
Varro
Titinius
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro

  BRUTUS.

Lucius
Varro
Titinius

  BRUTUS.

Lucius
Varro
Titinius

  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius

Ghost
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.

Lucius

  BRUTUS.

Lucius

  LUCIUS.

Lucius
Varro
Titinius

  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro

Lucius

  ANTONY. 
1
Octavius
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  ANTONY. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.
  MESSENGER. 
2
Octavius

SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
2
Octavius

TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
3
Octavius

  CASSIUS.

Octavius

Octavius

Brutus
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS.

Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
3
Octavius

TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS.

Octavius
Messenger
Brutus

Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
    If you dare fight today, come to the field;
    If not, when you have stomachs.
                        Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.

SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS.

  TITINIUS. 
1
Cassius
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,

Pindarus
Cassius
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS.

Pindarus

Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.

Pindarus
Cassius

  TITINIUS. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. All disconsolate,

3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
3
Pindarus

  TITINIUS. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,

Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius

Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius

Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,

3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
  TITINIUS. 
4
Pindarus
Messala
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.

Brutus
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
1

ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS.

RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
1
Brutus
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
1
Brutus
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
1
Brutus
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
1
Brutus
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
1
Brutus
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS. 
1

  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Not I.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I pray you, do.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Caesar
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Caesar
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
1
Caesar
ESAR. Antonio!
  ANTONY. 
1
Caesar
TONY. Caesar?
  CAESAR. 
1
Caesar
ESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,
  ANTONY. 
1
Caesar
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
1
Caesar
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
1
Cassius
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cinna
Cassius
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
                                                     Exit Cinna.
  CASCA.

Cassius
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
1
Cassius
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  CASSIUS.

Brutus

UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.

                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
2
Brutus
Lucius
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS.

Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS.

Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS.

Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS.

Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Cassius
Brutus
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS.

EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,

    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,

    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.

Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
2

Titinius
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Brutus
Titinius
SSIUS. No more. Good night.

3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro

  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius

  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius

Ghost
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.

  LUCIUS.

Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS.

Lucius
Varro

  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
3
Lucius
Varro
Titinius
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Lucius

3
Lucius

  ANTONY. 
1
Octavius
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  ANTONY. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.
  MESSENGER. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
2
Octavius

TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
2
Octavius
Messenger
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
3
Octavius

  CASSIUS.

Octavius

Octavius

Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
3
Octavius

Brutus
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
3
Octavius
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  OCTAVIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
    If you dare fight today, come to the field;
    If not, when you have stomachs.
                        Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.
  CASSIUS.

2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Messala,

Messenger
Brutus
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
2
Messenger
Brutus
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know

  TITINIUS. 
1
Cassius
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Pindarus
Cassius
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,

Pindarus
Cassius
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
2
Pindarus

Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.

Pindarus

  TITINIUS. 
3
Pindarus

Titinius
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA.

Pindarus
Cassius

  TITINIUS. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. All disconsolate,

3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
3
Pindarus

  TITINIUS. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,

Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius

3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius

  TITINIUS. 
3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,

3
Pindarus
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
  TITINIUS. 
4
Pindarus
Messala
Cassius
Titinius
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.

Brutus
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
1

ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS.

RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
1
Brutus
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
1
Brutus
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
1

LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
1
Brutus
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
Brutus
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
1
Brutus
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
1
Brutus
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.
  CASSIUS.

ESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.

0

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Not I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I pray you, do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Antonio!
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Caesar?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  CASSIUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
    And so, good morrow to you every one.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus, my lord!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS.

    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,

TONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
  ANTONY.

TONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed

UTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.
  ANTONY.

TONY. That's all I seek;

TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I do, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

RVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,
  ANTONY.

TONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.

UTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was
    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. I do not doubt
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. With courtesy and with respect enough,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Thou hast described
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark, he is arrived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark, he is arrived.
    March gently on to meet him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along.

IRD SOLDIER. Stand!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius, be content,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Pindarus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man
  BRUTUS. 
0
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. In such a time as this it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I an itching palm?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Chastisement?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, bait not me,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Go to, you are not, Cassius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I say you are not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Away, slight man!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is't possible?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hear me, for I will speak.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is it come to this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You say you are a better soldier:
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. If you did, I care not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I durst not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. For your life you durst not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I denied you not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You did.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You love me not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not like your faults.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sheathe your dagger.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hath Cassius lived
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And my heart too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What's the matter?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How now, what's the matter?
  POET. 
0
ET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No more. Good night.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O my dear brother!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Everything is well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good night, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good night, good brother.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here in the tent.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Varro and Claudio!
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. Calls my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Nor I, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.
  VARRO. 
0
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  BRUTUS. 
0
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
0
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  CATO. 
0
TO. Brave Titinius!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  CATO. 
0
TO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Only I yield to die.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!
  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  ANTONY. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hence! I will follow.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.

0
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  CASSIUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
    And so, good morrow to you every one.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,

TONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?

TONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
  CASSIUS.

TONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed

TONY. That's all I seek;

TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.
  SERVANT.

RVANT. I do, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

TONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;

  VARRO.

RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.
  GHOST.

OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
  VARRO.

RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Nor I, my lord.
  BRUTUS.

  ANTONY.

TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS.

TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  BRUTUS. 
0
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
0
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  CATO.

  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  CATO.

  LUCILIUS.

  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  ANTONY. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS.

  DARDANIUS. 
0

0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0

  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.

0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.

  BRUTUS. 
0

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Antonio!

0

0
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  CASSIUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,

UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;

0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
    And so, good morrow to you every one.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Set on your foot,

LPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
  CAESAR.

LPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;

0
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.
  CAESAR.

CIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say.
  CAESAR.

ESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!

OTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar

0
RTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
    The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
    Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit
    That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
    Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
    Say I am merry. Come to me again,
    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

SSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence

UTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,

  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
    That fears him much, and my misgiving still

UTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!

TONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Mark Antony-
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. That's all I seek;
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, a word with you.

SSIUS. I know not what may fall; I like it not.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Be it so,
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I do, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
  SERVANT.

RVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.

UTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was
    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.
  ALL.

UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,

SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS.

  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Cicero is dead,

0
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS.

RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.

UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.
  GHOST.

OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST.

OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS.

  BRUTUS.

UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO.

TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.

SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY.

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS.

  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  BRUTUS. 
0
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.

0
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.

  STRATO.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
    Caesar, now be still;
    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.            Dies.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. What man is that?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. How died my master, Strato?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.

  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?

0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  CASSIUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
    And so, good morrow to you every one.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Set on your foot,
  BRUTUS.

LPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. What can be avoided

LPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;

0
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
  SERVANT.

RVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.
  CAESAR.

CIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say.
  CAESAR.

ESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!

OTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar

OTHSAYER. None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.

0
RTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
    The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
    Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit
    That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
    Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
    Say I am merry. Come to me again,
    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

UTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence

UTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. So oft as that shall be,
  DECIUS.

CIUS. What, shall we forth?
  CASSIUS. 
0

UTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
    That fears him much, and my misgiving still
    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!

UTUS. Only be patient till we have appeased
  ANTONY.

TONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Mark Antony-
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. That's all I seek;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, a word with you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By your pardon,

SSIUS. I know not what may fall; I like it not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Be it so,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I do, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was
    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.

  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS.

UTUS. Sheathe your dagger.

SSIUS. Hath Cassius lived
  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.

SSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. No more. Good night.

  VARRO.

RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS.

RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO.

AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO.

RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO.

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  BRUTUS. 
0
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;

NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.

ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS.

  CLITUS.

ITUS. O Dardanius!

RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS.

0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS.

0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
    Caesar, now be still;

  STRATO.

  OCTAVIUS.

TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0

  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.

  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.

0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face

0

0

0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0

  CASCA. 
0

  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets,
    And the complexion of the element
    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.

UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS.

CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

0
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability;
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy.
    And so, good morrow to you every one.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
0
GARIUS. Set on your foot,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Follow me then.                                Exeunt.

  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. What can be avoided
  CALPURNIA.

LPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;

ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;

0
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.

CIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!

OTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar

0
RTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
    The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
    Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit

    Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
    Say I am merry. Come to me again,
    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

SSIUS. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
  CASSIUS.

  CASSIUS. 
0

RVANT. I'll fetch him presently.                       Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
    That fears him much, and my misgiving still
    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!

TONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.
  CASSIUS.

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. That's all I seek;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, a word with you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By your pardon,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know not what may fall; I like it not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Be it so,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
    And dreadful objects so familiar,
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I do, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
  ANTONY.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was
    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.
  ALL.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0

SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS.

  BRUTUS.

  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.

UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA.

SSALA. Cicero is dead,

0
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA.

SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA.

SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS.

  BRUTUS.

UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  BRUTUS.

    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.
    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.
  GHOST.

OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS.

  GHOST.

  GHOST.

OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS.

CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS.

  LUCIUS.

TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it. They could be content
    To visit other places, and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.

SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY.

  ANTONY.

TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS.

TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.

SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY.

TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS.

TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS.

TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS.

SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS.

CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?

SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  BRUTUS. 
0
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
0
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  CATO. 
0
TO. Brave Titinius!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  CATO. 
0
TO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Only I yield to die.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!
  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  ANTONY. 
0
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hence! I will follow.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
    Caesar, now be still;
    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.            Dies.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. What man is that?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. How died my master, Strato?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0

0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0

  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO.

CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA.

SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS.

  BRUTUS.

  LUCIUS.

UTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;

TONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I do, Mark Antony.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
  ANTONY.

TONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.

URTH CITIZEN. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;

  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
  LEPIDUS. 
0
PIDUS. What, shall I find you here?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So you thought him,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. You may do your will,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Stand, ho!
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. I do not doubt
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. With courtesy and with respect enough,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Thou hast described
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark, he is arrived.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand, ho!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Stand!

  THIRD 
0
IRD SOLDIER. Stand!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius, be content,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Pindarus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. In such a time as this it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I an itching palm?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Chastisement?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, bait not me,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Go to, you are not, Cassius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I say you are not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Away, slight man!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is't possible?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hear me, for I will speak.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is it come to this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You say you are a better soldier:
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. If you did, I care not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I durst not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. For your life you durst not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I denied you not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You did.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You love me not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not like your faults.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sheathe your dagger.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hath Cassius lived
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And my heart too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What's the matter?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How now, what's the matter?
  POET. 
0
ET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No more. Good night.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O my dear brother!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Everything is well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good night, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good night, good brother.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here in the tent.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Varro and Claudio!
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. Calls my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
0
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO. 
0
AUDIO. Nor I, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
  VARRO. 
0
RRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
0
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  CATO. 
0
TO. Brave Titinius!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  CATO. 
0
TO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Only I yield to die.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!
  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hence! I will follow.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. What man is that?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. How died my master, Strato?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Not I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I pray you, do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
CAESAR
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
1
CAESAR
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Antonio!
  ANTONY. 
1
CAESAR
TONY. Caesar?
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,
  ANTONY. 
1
CAESAR
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus, my lord!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. Set on your foot,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Follow me then.                                Exeunt.
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
  SERVANT.

RVANT. My lord?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I will, my lord.                                Exit.
  CALPURNIA.

LPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. What can be avoided
  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
  SERVANT. 
1
SERVANT
RVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
  CALPURNIA.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is it come to this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You say you are a better soldier:
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. If you did, I care not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I durst not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. For your life you durst not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I denied you not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You did.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You love me not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not like your faults.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sheathe your dagger.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hath Cassius lived
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And my heart too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What's the matter?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How now, what's the matter?
  POET. 
0
ET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
  CASSIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
SSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. No more. Good night.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Lucius!
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Lucius!
    My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. O my dear brother!
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Everything is well.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Good night, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Good night, good brother.
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
  BRUTUS.

LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Here in the tent.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Varro and Claudio!
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. Calls my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
AUDIO. Nor I, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
1
TITINIUS
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
  TITINIUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
  BRUTUS.

MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS.

CILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Only I yield to die.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!
  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Hence! I will follow.
  STRATO.

RATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. What man is that?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. How died my master, Strato?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.
  MESSALA.

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Not I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I pray you, do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
CAESAR
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
1
CAESAR
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Antonio!
  ANTONY. 
1
CAESAR
TONY. Caesar?
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,
  ANTONY. 
1
CAESAR
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus, my lord!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. Set on your foot,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Follow me then.                                Exeunt.
  CAESAR.

ESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
  SERVANT.

  CAESAR.

LPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. What can be avoided
  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
  SERVANT. 
1
SERVANT
RVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT

  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is it come to this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You say you are a better soldier:
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. If you did, I care not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I durst not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. For your life you durst not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I denied you not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You did.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You love me not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not like your faults.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sheathe your dagger.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hath Cassius lived
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And my heart too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What's the matter?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How now, what's the matter?
  POET. 
0
ET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
  CASSIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
SSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. No more. Good night.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Lucius!
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Lucius!
    My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. O my dear brother!
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Everything is well.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Good night, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Good night, good brother.
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.

LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
  LUCIUS.

LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Here in the tent.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Varro and Claudio!
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. Calls my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
AUDIO. Nor I, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
1
TITINIUS
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
  TITINIUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
  BRUTUS.

MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS.

CILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Only I yield to die.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!
  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Hence! I will follow.
  STRATO.

RATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  BRUTUS.

UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. What man is that?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. How died my master, Strato?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.
  MESSALA.

0
UTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.

0

ESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.

0

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Not I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I pray you, do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis just,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Another general shout!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
CAESAR
UTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
  BRUTUS. 
1
CAESAR
UTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
1
CAESAR
SSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Antonio!
  ANTONY. 
1
CAESAR
TONY. Caesar?
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,
  ANTONY. 
1
CAESAR
TONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
  CAESAR. 
1
CAESAR
ESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What was the second noise for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, for that too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who offered him the crown?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Why, Antony.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. To what effect?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No, I am promised forth.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Good, I will expect you.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. So is he now in execution
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio
  CICERO. 
0
CERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Who's there?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. A Roman.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Casca, by your voice.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. So can I.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. There's a bargain made.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Yes, you are.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What, Lucius, ho!
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. Call'd you, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
  LUCIUS. 
0
CIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no color for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities;
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. I know not, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.
                                     Opens the letter and reads.
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!
    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
    "Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
                                                    Exit Lucius.
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council, and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Is he alone?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Do you know them?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome hither.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. He is welcome too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They are all welcome.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. No.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Let us not leave him out.
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. No, by no means.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then leave him out.
  CASCA. 
0
SCA. Indeed he is not fit.
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Yet I fear him,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, count the clock.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.
  TREBONIUS. 
0
EBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. But it is doubtful yet
  DECIUS. 
0
CIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
  CINNA. 
0
NNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  METELLUS. 
0
TELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus, my lord!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,
  PORTIA. 
0
RTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O ye gods,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows.
    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks?
  LUCIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
CIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
  LIGARIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
GARIUS. Set on your foot,
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Follow me then.                                Exeunt.
  CAESAR.

ESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
  SERVANT.

RVANT. My lord?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
  SERVANT. 
0
RVANT. I will, my lord.                                Exit.
  CALPURNIA.

LPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. What can be avoided
  CALPURNIA. 
0
LPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
  CAESAR. 
0
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
  CAESAR. 
1
SERVANT
ESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
  SERVANT. 
1
SERVANT
RVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.
  CAESAR.

  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Is it come to this?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You say you are a better soldier:
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. If you did, I care not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I durst not?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. For your life you durst not.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I denied you not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. You did.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. You love me not.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I do not like your faults.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sheathe your dagger.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Hath Cassius lived
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And my heart too.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. What's the matter?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.
  POET. 
0
ET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How now, what's the matter?
  POET. 
0
ET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Ha? Portia?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. She is dead.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Impatient of my absence,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. And died so?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so.
  CASSIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
SSIUS. O ye immortal gods!
  BRUTUS. 
1
LUCIUS
UTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
  CASSIUS. 
1
LUCIUS
SSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. No more, I pray you.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. With what addition?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Cicero one!
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Cicero is dead,
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. No, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Nothing, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. That, methinks, is strange.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. No, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. I do not think it good.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Your reason?
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. This it is:
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Hear me, good brother.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. No more. Good night.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Lucius!
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Lucius!
    My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. O my dear brother!
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Everything is well.
  CASSIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
SSIUS. Good night, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Good night, good brother.
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
1
TITINIUS
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Farewell, everyone.
                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Here in the tent.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Varro and Claudio!
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. Calls my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. It does, my boy.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. It is my duty, sir.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why comest thou?
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?
  GHOST. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
OST. Ay, at Philippi.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
  LUCIUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
CIUS. Nothing, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. My lord?
  CLAUDIO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
AUDIO. My lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Ay, saw you anything?
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.
  CLAUDIO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
AUDIO. Nor I, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
UTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
  VARRO. 
2
LUCIUS
TITINIUS
RRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. Prepare you, generals.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. They stand, and would have parley.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Antony,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Not stingless too.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. So I hope,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Old Cassius still!
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala!
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Messala,
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Believe not so.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. I but believe it partly,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even so, Lucilius.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. They are, my lord.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
  TITINIUS. 
0
TINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. What news?
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
  CASSIUS. 
0
SSIUS. Come down; behold no more.
  PINDARUS. 
0
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
  PINDARUS. 
1
TITINIUS
NDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Where did you leave him?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. All disconsolate,
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Is not that he?
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
  MESSALA. 
1
TITINIUS
SSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
  TITINIUS. 
1
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
  TITINIUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TINIUS. Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
                                                  Kills himself.
  BRUTUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
  MESSALA. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
SSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
  BRUTUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Titinius' face is upward.
  CATO. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TO. He is slain.
  BRUTUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
  CATO. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
TO. Brave Titinius!
  BRUTUS. 
2
MESSALA
TITINIUS
UTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
  CATO. 
0
TO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Only I yield to die.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!
  SECOND 
0
COND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
  FIRST 
0
RST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. Where is he?
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Peace then, no words.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. I'll rather kill myself.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. O Dardanius!
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. O Clitus!
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
  DARDANIUS. 
0
RDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. What says my lord?
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.
  VOLUMNIUS. 
0
LUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
  CLITUS. 
0
ITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Hence! I will follow.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
  BRUTUS. 
0
UTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. What man is that?
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
  LUCILIUS. 
0
CILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
  OCTAVIUS. 
0
TAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. How died my master, Strato?
  STRATO. 
0
RATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.
  MESSALA. 
0
SSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee
  ANTONY. 
0
TONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.
  OCTAVIUS.

TAVIUS. According to his virtue let us use him
