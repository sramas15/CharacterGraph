Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?

Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.

He would not?

Ha! say'st thou so?

I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for

Safer than trust too far.

Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though

Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a

0
I did her wrong.
Fool

Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
Lear
0
No.
Fool

Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

0
Why?
Fool
0
Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters,

I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses

Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars

Because they are not eight?

Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.

How comes that?

Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the

Not I. Pray you, what are they?

Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes

Not a word.

You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.

Now, Edmund, where's the villain?

Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,

But where is he?
Edm

Look, sir, I bleed.
Glou

Where is the villain, Edmund?
Edm

Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
Glou

Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].
Edm

Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;

Let him fly far.

When I dissuaded him from his intent

Strong and fast'ned villain!

How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither

If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Glou

O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
Reg

What, did my father's godson seek your life?
Glou
0
O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
Reg

Was he not companion with the riotous knights
Glou

I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!
Edm
0
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
Reg
0
No marvel then though he were ill affected.
Corn

Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
Edm

'Twas my duty, sir.
Glou

He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd
Corn

Is he pursued?
Glou

Ay, my good lord.

If he be taken, he shall never more

I shall serve you, sir,

For him I thank your Grace.

You know not why we came to visit you-

Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.

Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?

Ay.
Osw

Where may we set our horses?

I' th' mire.
Osw

Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.
Kent

I love thee not.
Osw
0
Why then, I care not for thee.
Kent
0
If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for
Osw
0
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
Kent
0
Fellow, I know thee.
Osw
0
What dost thou know me for?
Kent
0
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
Osw
0
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one
Kent
0
What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me!
Osw
0
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
Kent
0
Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and
Osw
0
Help, ho! murther! help!
Kent

Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!
Osw

Help, ho! murther! murther!
Edm

How now? What's the matter?                 Parts [them].

With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh ye!

Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?
Corn

Keep peace, upon your lives!

The messengers from our sister and the King
Corn

What is your difference? Speak.
Osw

I am scarce in breath, my lord.
Kent
0
No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You cowardly
Corn
0
Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?
Kent

Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not have
Corn

Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd
Kent

Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if
Corn
0
Peace, sirrah!
Kent
0
Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
Corn
0
Why art thou angry?
Kent
0
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Corn
0
What, art thou mad, old fellow?
Glou
0
How fell you out? Say that.
Kent
0
No contraries hold more antipathy
Corn
0
Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
Kent
0
His countenance likes me not.
Corn
0
No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
Kent
0
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.
Corn
0
This is some fellow
Kent
0
Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
Corn
0
What mean'st by this?
Kent
0
To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I

0
What was th' offence you gave him?
Osw
0
I never gave him any.
Kent
0
None of these rogues and cowards
Corn
0
Fetch forth the stocks!
Kent
0
Sir, I am too old to learn.
Corn
0
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
Reg
0
Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
Kent
0
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
Reg
0
Sir, being his knave, I will.
Corn
0
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
Glou
0
Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
Corn
0
I'll answer that.
Reg
0
My sister may receive it much more worse,
Glou
0
I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,
Kent
0
Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.
Glou
0
The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

Good King, that must approve the common saw,

No, I say.

I say yea.

No, no, they would not!

Yes, they have.

By Juno, I swear ay!

They durst not do't;

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!

Follow me not;

Made you no more offence but what you speak of?

None.

Why, fool?

We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no

Not i' th' stocks, fool.

My dear lord,

Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!

Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
Lear

Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?

Ay, my good lord.

The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father

I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.
Lear
0
O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
Fool

Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she
Lear
0
Good morrow to you both.
Corn
0
Hail to your Grace!
Reg
0
I am glad to see your Highness.
Lear
0
Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
Reg
0
I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
Lear
0
Say, how is that?
Reg
0
I cannot think my sister in the least
Lear
0
My curses on her!
Reg
0
O, sir, you are old!
Lear
0
Ask her forgiveness?
Reg
0
Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.
Lear
0
[rises] Never, Regan!
Corn
0
Fie, sir, fie!
Lear
0
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Reg
0
O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
Lear
0
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
Reg
0
Good sir, to th' purpose.
Lear
0
Who put my man i' th' stocks?
Corn
0
What trumpet's that?
Reg
0
I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,
Lear
0
This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
Corn
0
What means your Grace?
Lear
0
Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
Gon
0
Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?
Lear
0
O sides, you are too tough!
Corn
0
I set him there, sir; but his own disorders
Lear
0
You? Did you?
Reg
0
I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
Lear
0
Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
Gon
0
At your choice, sir.
Lear
0
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
Reg
0
Not altogether so.
Lear
0
Is this well spoken?
Reg
0
I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
Gon
0
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
Reg
0
Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,
Lear
0
I gave you all-
Reg
0
And in good time you gave it!
Lear
0
Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
Reg
0
And speak't again my lord. No more with me.
Lear
0
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
Gon
0
Hear, me, my lord.
Reg
0
What need one?
Lear
0
O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
Corn
0
Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
Reg
0
This house is little; the old man and 's people
Gon
0
'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
Reg
0
For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
Gon
0
So am I purpos'd.
Corn
0
Followed the old man forth.
Glou
0
The King is in high rage.
Corn
0
Whither is he going?
Glou
0
He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.
Corn
0
'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
Gon
0
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
Glou
0
Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
Reg
0
O, sir, to wilful men
Corn
0
Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.
Kent
0
Who's there, besides foul weather?
Gent
0
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
Kent
0
I know you. Where's the King?
Gent
0
Contending with the fretful elements;
Kent
0
But who is with him?
Gent
0
None but the fool, who labours to outjest
Kent
0
Sir, I do know you,
Gent
0
I will talk further with you.
Kent
0
No, do not.
Gent
0
Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
Kent
0
Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:
Lear
0
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
Fool
0
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this
Lear
0
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
Fool
0
He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece.
Lear
0
No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
Kent
0
Who's there?
Fool
0
Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a

Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night

Let the great gods,

Alack, bareheaded?

My wits begin to turn.

Lear
0
True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
Fool

This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a

Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing! When
Edm
0
Most savage and unnatural!
Glou

Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the Dukes,

This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke

0
Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.
Lear
0
Let me alone.
Kent
0
Good my lord, enter here.
Lear
0
Wilt break my heart?
Kent
0
I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
Lear
0
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
Kent
0
Good my lord, enter here.
Lear
0
Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.
Edg
0
[within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
Fool
0
Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help me!
Kent
0
Give me thy hand. Who's there?
Fool
0
A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.
Kent
0
What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
Edg
0
Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn
Lear
0
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come
Edg
0
Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
Lear
0
What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
Fool
0
Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.
Lear
0
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Kent
0
He hath no daughters, sir.
Lear
0
Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
Edg
0
Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo, loo!
Fool
0
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
Edg
0
Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy word
Lear
0
What hast thou been?
Edg
0
A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair,
Lear
0
Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
Fool
0
Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to swim
Edg
0
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at curfew,
Kent
0
How fares your Grace?
Lear
0
What's he?
Kent
0
Who's there? What is't you seek?
Glou
0
What are you there? Your names?
Edg
0
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole,
Glou
0
What, hath your Grace no better company?
Edg
0
The prince of darkness is a gentleman!
Glou
0
Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
Edg
0
Poor Tom 's acold.
Glou
0
Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer
Lear
0
First let me talk with this philosopher.
Kent
0
Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.
Lear
0
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
Edg
0
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
Lear
0
Let me ask you one word in private.
Kent
0
Importune him once more to go, my lord.
Glou
0
Canst thou blame him?
Lear
0
O, cry you mercy, sir.
Edg
0
Tom's acold.
Glou
0
In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.
Lear
0
Come, let's in all.
Kent
0
This way, my lord.
Lear
0
With him!
Kent
0
Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
Glou
0
Take him you on.
Kent
0
Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
Lear
0
Come, good Athenian.
Glou
0
No words, no words! hush.
Edg
0
Child Rowland to the dark tower came;
Corn
0
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
Edm
0
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to
Corn
0
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil
Edm
0
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!
Corn
0
Go with me to the Duchess.
Edm
0
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty
Corn

True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.
Edm

I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer

All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.

Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the

Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a

No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a

To have a thousand with red burning spits
Edg

The foul fiend bites my back.
Fool

He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's
Lear
0
It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
Edg
0
Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at trial,
Fool
0
     Her boat hath a leak,
Edg
0
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.
Kent
0
How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.
Lear
0
I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.
Edg
0
Let us deal justly.
Lear
0
Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before
Fool
0
Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
Lear
0
She cannot deny it.
Fool
0
Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
Lear
0
And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
Edg
0
Bless thy five wits!
Kent
0
O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
Edg
0
[aside] My tears begin to take his part so much
Lear
0
The little dogs and all,
Edg
0
Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
Lear
0
Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her
Kent
0
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
Lear
0
Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.
Fool
0
And I'll go to bed at noon.
Glou
0
Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?
Kent
0
Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.
Glou
0
Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.
Kent
0
Oppressed nature sleeps.
Glou
0
Come, come, away!
Edg
0
When we our betters see bearing our woes,
Corn
0
[to Goneril] Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him
Reg
0
Hang him instantly.
Gon
0
Pluck out his eyes.
Corn
0
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister
Osw
0
My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence.
Corn
0
Get horses for your mistress.
Gon
0
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
Corn
0
Edmund, farewell.
Reg
0
Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
Corn
0
Bind fast his corky arms.
Glou
0
What mean, your Graces? Good my friends, consider
Corn
0
Bind him, I say.
Reg
0
Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
Glou
0
Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.
Corn
0
To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-
Glou
0
By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
Reg
0
So white, and such a traitor!
Glou
0
Naughty lady,
Corn
0
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
Reg
0
Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.
Corn
0
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Reg
0
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
Glou
0
I have a letter guessingly set down,
Corn
0
Cunning.
Reg
0
And false.
Corn
0
Where hast thou sent the King?
Glou
0
To Dover.
Reg
0
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-
Corn
0
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
Glou
0
I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
Reg
0
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
Glou
0
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Corn
0
See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
Glou
0
He that will think to live till he be old,
Reg
0
One side will mock another. Th' other too!
Corn
0
If you see vengeance-
Reg
0
How now, you dog?
Reg
0
What do you mean?
Corn
0
My villain!                               Draw and fight.
Reg
0
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
Corn
0
Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
Glou
0
All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?
Reg
0
Out, treacherous villain!
Glou
0
O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.
Reg
0
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
Corn
0
I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.
Edg
0
Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
Old Man
0
O my good lord,
Glou
0
Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.
Old Man
0
You cannot see your way.
Glou
0
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
Old Man
0
How now? Who's there?
Edg
0
[aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?
Old Man
0
'Tis poor mad Tom.
Edg
0
[aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
Old Man
0
Fellow, where goest?
Glou
0
Is it a beggarman?
Old Man
0
Madman and beggar too.
Glou
0
He has some reason, else he could not beg.
Edg
0
[aside] How should this be?
Glou
0
Is that the naked fellow?
Old Man
0
Ay, my lord.
Glou
0
Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake
Old Man
0
Alack, sir, he is mad!
Glou
0
'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.
Old Man
0
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
Glou
0
Sirrah naked fellow-
Edg
0
Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.
Glou
0
Come hither, fellow.
Edg
0
[aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
Glou
0
Know'st thou the way to Dover?
Edg
0
Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been
Glou
0
Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
Edg
0
Ay, master.
Glou
0
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
Edg
0
Give me thy arm.
Gon
0
Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
Osw
0
Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.
Gon
0
[to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.
Edm
0
Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.
Gon
0
My most dear Gloucester!
Osw
0
Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.
Gon
0
I have been worth the whistle.
Alb
0
O Goneril,
Gon
0
No more! The text is foolish.
Alb
0
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
Gon
0
Milk-liver'd man!
Alb
0
See thyself, devil!
Gon
0
O vain fool!
Alb
0
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!
Gon
0
Marry, your manhood mew!
Alb
0
What news?
Gent
0
O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,
Alb
0
Gloucester's eyes?
Gent
0
A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
Alb
0
This shows you are above,
Gent
0
Both, both, my lord.
Gon
0
[aside] One way I like this well;
Alb
0
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Gent
0
Come with my lady hither.
Alb
0
He is not here.
Gent
0
No, my good lord; I met him back again.
Alb
0
Knows he the wickedness?
Gent
0
Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,
Alb
0
Gloucester, I live
Kent
0
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
Gent
0
Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his
Kent
0
Who hath he left behind him general?
Gent
0
The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
Kent
0
Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
Gent
0
Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,
Kent
0
O, then it mov'd her?
Gent
0
Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
Kent
0
Made she no verbal question?
Gent
0
Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father
Kent
0
It is the stars,
Gent
0
No.
Kent
0
Was this before the King return'd?
Gent
0
No, since.
Kent
0
Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;
Gent
0
Why, good sir?
Kent
0
A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,
Gent
0
Alack, poor gentleman!
Kent
0
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
Gent
0
'Tis so; they are afoot.
Kent
0
Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear
Cor
0
Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now
Doct
0
There is means, madam.
Cor
0
All blest secrets,
Mess
0
News, madam.
Cor
0
'Tis known before. Our preparation stands
Reg
0
But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
Osw
0
Ay, madam.
Reg
0
Himself in person there?
Osw
0
Madam, with much ado.
Reg
0
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
Osw
0
No, madam.
Reg
0
What might import my sister's letter to him?
Osw
0
I know not, lady.
Reg
0
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
Osw
0
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
Reg
0
Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.
Osw
0
I may not, madam.
Reg
0
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Osw
0
Madam, I had rather-
Reg
0
I know your lady does not love her husband;
Osw
0
I, madam?
Reg
0
I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.
Osw
0
Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
Reg
0
Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.
Glou
0
When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?
Edg
0
You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
Glou
0
Methinks the ground is even.
Edg
0
Horrible steep.
Glou
0
No, truly.
Edg
0
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
Glou
0
So may it be indeed.
Edg
0
Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd
Glou
0
Methinks y'are better spoken.
Edg
0
Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful
Glou
0
Set me where you stand.
Edg
0
Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
Glou
0
Let go my hand.
Edg
0
Now fare ye well, good sir.
Glou
0
With all my heart.
Edg
0
[aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Glou
0
O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.
Edg
0
Gone, sir, farewell.-
Glou
0
Away, and let me die.
Edg
0
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
Glou
0
But have I fall'n, or no?
Edg
0
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Glou
0
Alack, I have no eyes!
Edg
0
Give me your arm.
Glou
0
Too well, too well.
Edg
0
This is above all strangeness.
Glou
0
A poor unfortunate beggar.
Edg
0
As I stood here below, methought his eyes
Glou
0
I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear
Edg
0
Bear free and patient thoughts.
Lear
0
No, they cannot touch me for coming;
Edg
0
O thou side-piercing sight!
Lear
0
Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press
Edg
0
Sweet marjoram.
Lear
0
Pass.
Glou
0
I know that voice.
Lear
0
Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a dog,
Glou
0
The trick of that voice I do well remember.
Lear
0
Ay, every inch a king!
Glou
0
O, let me kiss that hand!
Lear
0
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
Glou
0
O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
Lear
0
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
Glou
0
Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
Edg
0
[aside] I would not take this from report. It is,
Lear
0
Read.
Glou
0
What, with the case of eyes?
Lear
0
O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no
Glou
0
I see it feelingly.
Lear
0
What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.
Glou
0
Ay, sir.
Lear
0
And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
Edg
0
O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
Lear
0
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
Glou
0
Alack, alack the day!
Lear
0
When we are born, we cry that we are come
Gent
0
O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
Lear
0
No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
Gent
0
You shall have anything.
Lear
0
No seconds? All myself?
Gent
0
Good sir-
Lear
0
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!
Gent
0
You are a royal one, and we obey you.
Lear
0
Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it
Gent
0
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
Edg
0
Hail, gentle sir.
Gent
0
Sir, speed you. What's your will?
Edg
0
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
Gent
0
Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that
Edg
0
But, by your favour,
Gent
0
Near and on speedy foot. The main descry
Edg
0
I thank you sir. That's all.
Gent
0
Though that the Queen on special cause is here,
Edg
0
I thank you, sir
Glou
0
You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
Edg
0
Well pray you, father.
Glou
0
Now, good sir, what are you?
Edg
0
A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
Glou
0
Hearty thanks.
Osw
0
A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
Glou
0
Now let thy friendly hand
Osw
0
Wherefore, bold peasant,
Edg
0
Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.
Osw
0
Let go, slave, or thou diest!
Edg
0
Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An chud
Osw
0
Out, dunghill!
Edg

Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.
Osw
0
Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
Edg
0
I know thee well. A serviceable villain,
Glou
0
What, is he dead?
Edg
0
Sit you down, father; rest you.
Glou
0
The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
Edg
0
Give me your hand.
Cor
0
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
Kent
0
To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.
Cor
0
Be better suited.
Kent
0
Pardon, dear madam.
Cor
0
Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the King?
Doct
0
Madam, sleeps still.
Cor
0
O you kind gods,
Doct
0
So please your Majesty
Cor
0
Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
Gent
0
Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep
Doct
0
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
Cor
0
Very well.
Doct
0
Please you draw near. Louder the music there!
Cor
0
O my dear father, restoration hang
Kent
0
Kind and dear princess!
Cor
0
Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Doct
0
Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
Cor
0
How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?
Lear
0
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
Cor
0
Sir, do you know me?
Lear
0
You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?
Cor
0
Still, still, far wide!
Doct
0
He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
Lear
0
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,
Cor
0
O, look upon me, sir,
Lear
0
Pray, do not mock me.
Cor
0
And so I am! I am!
Lear
0
Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.
Cor
0
No cause, no cause.
Lear
0
Am I in France?
Kent
0
In your own kingdom, sir.
Lear
0
Do not abuse me.
Doct
0
Be comforted, good madam. The great rage
Cor
0
Will't please your Highness walk?
Lear
0
You must bear with me.
Gent
0
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
Kent
0
Most certain, sir.
Gent
0
Who is conductor of his people?
Kent
0
As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
Gent
0
They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of Kent
Kent
0
Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers of
Gent
0
The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
Kent
0
My point and period will be throughly wrought,
Edm
0
Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
Reg
0
Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
Edm
0
Tis to be doubted, madam.
Reg
0
Now, sweet lord,
Edm
0
In honour'd love.
Reg
0
But have you never found my brother's way
Edm
0
That thought abuses you.
Reg
0
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
Edm
0
No, by mine honour, madam.
Reg
0
I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
Edm
0
Fear me not.
Gon
0
[aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Alb
0
Our very loving sister, well bemet.
Edm
0
Sir, you speak nobly.
Reg
0
Why is this reason'd?
Gon
0
Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
Alb
0
Let's then determine
Edm
0
I shall attend you presently at your tent.
Reg
0
Sister, you'll go with us?
Gon
0
No.
Reg
0
'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.
Gon
0
[aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go.
Edg
0
If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,
Alb
0
I'll overtake you.- Speak.
Edg
0
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
Alb
0
Stay till I have read the letter.
Edg
0
I was forbid it.
Alb
0
Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.
Edm
0
The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.
Alb
0
We will greet the time.                             Exit.
Edm
0
To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
Edg
0
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
Glou
0
Grace go with you, sir!
Edg
0
Away, old man! give me thy hand! away!
Glou
0
No further, sir. A man may rot even here.
Edg
0
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Glou
0
And that's true too.                             Exeunt.
Edm
0
Some officers take them away. Good guard
Cor
0
We are not the first
Lear
0
No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.
Edm
0
Take them away.
Lear
0
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
Edm
0
Come hither, Captain; hark.
Capt
0
I'll do't, my lord.
Edm
0
About it! and write happy when th' hast done.
Capt
0
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
Alb
0
Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
Edm
0
Sir, I thought it fit
Alb
0
Sir, by your patience,
Reg
0
That's as we list to grace him.
Gon
0
Not so hot!
Reg
0
In my rights
Gon
0
That were the most if he should husband you.
Reg
0
Jesters do oft prove prophets.
Gon
0
Holla, holla!
Reg
0
Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
Gon
0
Mean you to enjoy him?
Alb
0
The let-alone lies not in your good will.
Edm
0
Nor in thine, lord.
Alb
0
Half-blooded fellow, yes.
Reg
0
[to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
Alb
0
Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
Gon
0
An interlude!
Alb
0
Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
Reg
0
Sick, O, sick!
Gon
0
[aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
Edm
0
There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the world
Alb
0
A herald, ho!
Edm
0
A herald, ho, a herald!
Alb
0
Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
Reg
0
My sickness grows upon me.
Alb
0
She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
Capt
0
Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.
Her
0
(reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists of
Edm
0
Sound!                                     First trumpet.
Her
0
Again!                                    Second trumpet.
Her
0
Again!                                     Third trumpet.
Alb
0
Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Her
0
What are you?
Edg
0
Know my name is lost;
Alb
0
Which is that adversary?
Edg
0
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
Edm
0
Himself. What say'st thou to him?
Edg
0
Draw thy sword,
Edm
0
In wisdom I should ask thy name;
Alb
0
Save him, save him!
Gon
0
This is mere practice, Gloucester.
Alb
0
Shut your mouth, dame,
Gon
0
Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
Alb
0
Most monstrous!
Gon
0
Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.
Alb
0
Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.
Edm
0
What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,
Edg
0
Let's exchange charity.
Edm
0
Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.
Alb
0
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
Edg
0
Worthy prince, I know't.
Alb
0
Where have you hid yourself?
Edg
0
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
Edm
0
This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
Alb
0
If there be more, more woful, hold it in;
Edg
0
This would have seem'd a period
Alb
0
But who was this?
Edg
0
Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Gent
0
Help, help! O, help!
Edg
0
What kind of help?
Alb
0
Speak, man.
Edg
0
What means that bloody knife?
Gent
0
'Tis hot, it smokes.
Alb
0
Who dead? Speak, man.
Gent
0
Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister
Edm
0
I was contracted to them both. All three
Edg
0
Here comes Kent.
Alb
0
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
Kent
0
I am come
Alb
0
Great thing of us forgot!
Kent
0
Alack, why thus?
Edm
0
Yet Edmund was belov'd.
Alb
0
Even so. Cover their faces.
Edm
0
I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
Alb
0
Run, run, O, run!
Edg
0
To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
Edm
0
Well thought on. Take my sword;
Alb
0
Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]
Edm
0
He hath commission from thy wife and me
Alb
0
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
Lear
0
Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
Kent
0
Is this the promis'd end?
Edg
0
Or image of that horror?
Alb
0
Fall and cease!
Lear
0
This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,
Kent
0
O my good master!
Lear
0
Prithee away!
Edg
0
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
Lear
0
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
Capt
0
'Tis true, my lords, he did.
Lear
0
Did I not, fellow?
Kent
0
If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,
Lear
0
This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
Kent
0
The same-
Lear
0
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
Kent
0
No, my good lord; I am the very man-
Lear
0
I'll see that straight.
Kent
0
That from your first of difference and decay
Lear
0
You're welcome hither.
Kent
0
Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Lear
0
Ay, so I think.
Alb
0
He knows not what he says; and vain is it
Edg
0
Very bootless.
Capt
0
Edmund is dead, my lord.
Alb
0
That's but a trifle here.
Lear
0
And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
Edg
0
He faints! My lord, my lord!
Kent
0
Break, heart; I prithee break!
Edg
0
Look up, my lord.
Kent
0
Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him
Edg
0
He is gone indeed.
Kent
0
The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.
Alb
0
Bear them from hence. Our present business
Kent
0
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
Alb
0
The weight of this sad time we must obey,
