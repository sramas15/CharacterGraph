Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

IAGO

RODERIGO
'Sblood, but you will not hear me.
If ever I did dream of such a matter,
Abhor me.

RODERIGO

IAGO
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

IAGO

RODERIGO
Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war,
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, "Certes," says he,
"I have already chose my officer."
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine
(A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife)
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be belee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor. This counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I- God bless the mark!- his Moorship's ancient.

RODERIGO
1
IAGO
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

IAGO
1
RODERIGO
Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service,
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
And not by old gradation, where each second
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor.

RODERIGO
1
IAGO
          I would not follow him then.

IAGO
1
RODERIGO
O, sir, content you.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
That doting on his own obsequious bondage
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd.
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And throwing but shows of service on their lords
Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,
And such a one do I profess myself.
For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
In following him, I follow but myself;
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end.
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In complement extern, 'tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

RODERIGO
1
IAGO
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,
If he can carry't thus!

IAGO
1
RODERIGO
                    Call up her father,
Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,
Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't
As it may lose some color.

RODERIGO
1
IAGO
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

IAGO

As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities.

I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.

Sir, sir, sir-

In simple and pure soul I come to you.

IAGO

'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God,
if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you
think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a
Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.

RODERIGO
2
IAGO
BRABANTIO
Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you,
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor-
If this be known to you, and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
But if you know not this, my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.

BRABANTIO

RODERIGO
              Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!

Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light!

IAGO

RODERIGO
                 Farewell, for I must leave you.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
To be produced- as, if I stay, I shall-
Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,
However this may gall him with some check,
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead their business; in which regard,
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,
Yet for necessity of present life,
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,
And there will I be with him. So farewell.

BRABANTIO

RODERIGO
It is too true an evil: gone she is,
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers.
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

RODERIGO
1
BRABANTIO
Truly, I think they are.

BRABANTIO

RODERIGO
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?

RODERIGO
1
BRABANTIO
            Yes, sir, I have indeed.

BRABANTIO

Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO

I think I can discover him, if you please
To get good guard and go along with me.

BRABANTIO

Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.

Though in the trade of war I have slain men,

Against your honor
That, with the little godliness I have,
I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
That the magnifico is much beloved,
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the Duke's. He will divorce you,
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
Will give him cable.

Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,
I shall promulgate- I fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege, and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reach'd. For know, Iago,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
I would not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the sea's worth. But, look! What lights come yond?

Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
It is a business of some heat. The galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels;
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for,
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The Senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out.

O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou- to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion. I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practicer
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.

For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
But altogether lacks the abilities

Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her;
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field,
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration, and what mighty magic-
For such proceeding I am charged withal-
I won his daughter.

It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect,
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven

Her father loved me, oft invited me,
Still question'd me the story of my life
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have pass'd.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days
To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history;
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline;
But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively. I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.

Patience her injury a mockery makes.

He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar or to gall,
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.

Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so
that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed
up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with
many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with
industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of
reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of
our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions.
But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings,
our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to
be a sect or scion.

better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou
the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put
money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long
continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his
to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an
answerable sequestration- put but money in thy purse. These Moors
are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money. The
food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him
shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth;
when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her
choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in
thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate
way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony
and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle
Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell,
thou shalt enjoy her- therefore make money. A pox of drowning
thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be

And will as tenderly be led by the nose

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me
with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and
telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for
prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be
fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When
the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be,
again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite,
loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties-
all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor;
very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and
unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this
fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose
affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a
finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present
itself- a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds
look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found
him already.

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin,
But partly led to diet my revenge,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards,
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife.
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),
Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
For making him egregiously an ass
And practicing upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.

It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,
that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere
perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into
triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what
sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these
beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much
was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and
there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five

Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
That hold their honors in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle,
Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,

While I spare speech, which something now offends me-

Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.

Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on,
And he that is approved in this offense,
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?

                 Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio;
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help,
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamor- as it so fell out-
The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight
I ne'er might say before. When I came back-
For this was brief- I found them close together,
At blow and thrust, even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
From him that fled some strange indignity,
Which patience could not pass.

As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily

is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and

of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her;
importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so
free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a
vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This
broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter;

And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
That she repeals him for her body's lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.

And wit depends on dilatory time.

And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.

Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.

OTHELLO
CASSIO
                 Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
And fearful to be granted.

OTHELLO

IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                    I will deny thee nothing,
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.

Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.

Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.

DESDEMONA

Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

OTHELLO

Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again.

IAGO

OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
My noble lord-

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
            What dost thou say, Iago?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
          Why of thy thought, Iago?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
O, yes, and went between us very oft.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Indeed!

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Honest, my lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Honest? Ay, honest.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
My lord, for aught I know.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
What dost thou think?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Think, my lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.
I heard thee say even now, thou like'st not that,
When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, "Indeed!"
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
My lord, you know I love you.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                           I think thou dost;
And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just
They're close dilations, working from the heart,
That passion cannot rule.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                      For Michael Cassio,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I think so too.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                   Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Certain, men should be what they seem.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Nay, yet there's more in this.
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                Good my lord, pardon me;
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit
With meditations lawful?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                        I do beseech you-
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                      What dost thou mean?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Ha!

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
       O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
O misery!

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
        Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago,
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this-
Away at once with love or jealousy!

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.
I would not have your free and noble nature
Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to't.
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Dost thou say so?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
              And so she did.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                                 Why, go to then.
She that so young could give out such a seeming,
To seel her father's eyes up close as oak-
He thought 'twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                  I am bound to thee forever.

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

OTHELLO

Not a jot, not a jot.

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                         I'faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved;
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I will not.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
               Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
Which my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-
My lord, I see you're moved.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                      No, not much moved.
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
And yet, how nature erring from itself-

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends-
Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me. I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear,
Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,
May fall to match you with her country forms,
And happily repent.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
             Farewell, farewell.
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
[Going.] My lord, I take my leave.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
[Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
For sure he fills it up with great ability,
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
You shall by that perceive him and his means.
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears-
As worthy cause I have to fear I am-
And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Fear not my government.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I once more take my leave.

OTHELLO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
Prerogatived are they less than the base;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe't.

DESDEMONA

EMILIA
OTHELLO
CASSIO
           How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.

OTHELLO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I am to blame.

DESDEMONA
3
EMILIA
OTHELLO
CASSIO
             Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

OTHELLO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I have a pain upon my forehead here.

DESDEMONA
3
EMILIA
OTHELLO
CASSIO
Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.

OTHELLO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
          Your napkin is too little;
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

DESDEMONA
3
EMILIA
OTHELLO
CASSIO
I am very sorry that you are not well.

EMILIA
3
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I am glad I have found this napkin;
This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago. What he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA

How now, what do you here alone?

EMILIA

IAGO
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA

A thing for me? It is a common thing-

EMILIA
4
IAGO
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Ha!

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
To have a foolish wife.

EMILIA

IAGO
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
O, is that all? What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                        What handkerchief?

EMILIA
4
IAGO
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
That which so often you did bid me steal.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Hast stol'n it from her?

EMILIA
4
IAGO
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
And, to the advantage, I being here took't up.
Look, here it is.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
              A good wench; give it me.

EMILIA
4
IAGO
OTHELLO

What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
To have me filch it?

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
[Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?

EMILIA
4
IAGO
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA

If't be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again. Poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.

IAGO

OTHELLO
Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.

OTHELLO

                      Ha, ha, false to me?

Why, how now, general! No more of that.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO

Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Than but to know't a little.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO

CASSIO
                         How now, my lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me;
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips.
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I am sorry to hear this.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA

I had been happy if the general camp,
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
So I had nothing known. O, now forever
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell,
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit,
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

IAGO

CASSIO
Is't possible, my lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof;
Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath!

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO

CASSIO
                        Is't come to this?

OTHELLO

Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

IAGO

OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
My noble lord-

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
               O grace! O heaven defend me!
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool,
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit, and from hence
I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA

I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
And loses that it works for.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                      By the world,
I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;
I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,
Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?

OTHELLO

                 Would? Nay, I will.

IAGO
4
EMILIA

And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?
Behold her topp'd?

OTHELLO

IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
            Death and damnation! O!

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I do not like the office;
But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;
One of this kind is Cassio.
In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves";
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry, "O sweet creature!" and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,
That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kiss'd; and then
Cried, "Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!"

OTHELLO

IAGO

O monstrous! monstrous!

IAGO

EMILIA
OTHELLO

                           Nay, this was but his dream.

OTHELLO

CASSIO
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

IAGO
4

And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.

OTHELLO

                     I'll tear her all to pieces.

IAGO
4
EMILIA
OTHELLO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this;
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

IAGO

I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
I am sure it was your wife's- did I today
See Cassio wipe his beard with.

If it be that, or any that was hers,

CASSIO
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago,
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

CASSIO
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
In the due reverence of a sacred vow                      Kneels.
I here engage my words.

                    Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.                             They rise.

                    I greet thy love,

Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassio's not alive.

My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
But let her live.

Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

CLOWN

DESDEMONA
I dare not say he lies anywhere.

DESDEMONA
1
CLOWN
Why, man?

CLOWN
1
DESDEMONA
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
stabbing.

DESDEMONA
1
CLOWN
Go to! Where lodges he?

CLOWN
1
DESDEMONA
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

DESDEMONA
1
CLOWN
Can anything be made of this?

CLOWN
1
DESDEMONA
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own
throat.

DESDEMONA
1
CLOWN
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?

CLOWN
1
DESDEMONA
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
and by them answer.

DESDEMONA

CLOWN
Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.

CLOWN

To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
I will attempt the doing it.

Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

EMILIA

I know not, madam.

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
                      Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humors from him.

EMILIA

DESDEMONA
                         Look, where he comes.

DESDEMONA

I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.

Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
How do you, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

EMILIA
OTHELLO
              Well, my good lord.

OTHELLO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout,
For here's a young and sweating devil here
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
What promise, chuck?

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

OTHELLO

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
Here, my lord.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
That which I gave you.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
I have it not about me.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Not?

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
No, faith, my lord.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
That's a fault. That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies. She dying gave it me,
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so, and take heed on't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
                    Is't possible?

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,
And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
Conserved of maiden's hearts.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
                     Indeed! is't true?

OTHELLO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

DESDEMONA

Then would to God that I had never seen't!

OTHELLO

Ha! wherefore?

DESDEMONA

Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

OTHELLO

I say, it is not lost.

OTHELLO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Fetch't, let me see it.

DESDEMONA

Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.

DESDEMONA

Come, come,

OTHELLO

The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
                I pray, talk me of Cassio.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
                A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you-

OTHELLO

EMILIA

The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
In sooth, you are to blame.

OTHELLO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Away!

EMILIA

DESDEMONA
Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA

EMILIA
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief;
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.

DESDEMONA

IAGO

How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?

CASSIO
3
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honor. I would not be delay'd.
If my offense be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past nor present sorrows
Nor purposed merit in futurity
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content
And shut myself up in some other course
To Fortune's alms.

DESDEMONA

IAGO
EMILIA
CASSIO
          Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him
Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.

IAGO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Is my lord angry?

EMILIA
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
                He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.

IAGO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother. And can he be angry?
Something of moment then. I will go meet him.
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.

DESDEMONA
3
IAGO
EMILIA
CASSIO
I prithee, do so.

EMILIA

IAGO
CASSIO
Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.

DESDEMONA
3
IAGO
EMILIA
CASSIO
Alas the day, I never gave him cause!

EMILIA
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
CASSIO
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous. 'Tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

EMILIA

Lady, amen.

DESDEMONA

More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!

BIANCA
IAGO

             Pardon me, Bianca.

Take me this work out.

BIANCA

                 O Cassio, whence came this?

Is't come to this? Well, well.

CASSIO

BIANCA
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                         Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,

That this is from some mistress, some remembrance.
No, by my faith, Bianca.

BIANCA

I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well. Ere it be demanded-
As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

CASSIO

                      Why, I pray you?

Not that I love you not.

BIANCA

IAGO
CASSIO

And say if I shall see you soon at night.

To kiss in private?

OTHELLO

             An unauthorized kiss.

IAGO

Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

OTHELLO

Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
They that mean virtuously and yet do so,
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.

So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief-

OTHELLO

What then?

IAGO

Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

OTHELLO

She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?

IAGO

Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not.
But for the handkerchief-

OTHELLO

By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Thou said'st- O, it comes o'er my memory,
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
Boding to all- he had my handkerchief.

IAGO

OTHELLO
Ay, what of that?

OTHELLO
1

Who having, by their own importunate suit,
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
But they must blab-

OTHELLO

IAGO
             Hath he said anything?

He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
No more than he'll unswear.

OTHELLO

Lie-

OTHELLO

Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they
belie her. Lie with her! 'Zounds, that's fulsome! Handkerchief-
confessions- handkerchief! To confess and be hanged for his labor-
first, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without
some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish!
Noses, ears, and lips. Is't possible? Confess? Handkerchief? O
devil!

IAGO
1
OTHELLO
Work on,
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
My lord, I say! Othello!

My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.

Rub him about the temples.

IAGO

OTHELLO
CASSIO
                             No, forbear;
The lethargy must have his quiet course.
If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
He will recover straight. When he is gone,
I would on great occasion speak with you.

OTHELLO

Dost thou mock me?

IAGO

OTHELLO

A horned man's a monster and a beast.

IAGO

Did he confess it?

IAGO

CASSIO
OTHELLO
                      Good sir, be a man;
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you. There's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

OTHELLO

O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
                                   Stand you awhile apart,
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;
Bade him anon return and here speak with me
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife.
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
               Dost thou hear, Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.

IAGO

CASSIO
OTHELLO
                               That's not amiss;
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behavior
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
How quickly should you speed!

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
                        Alas, poor caitiff!

OTHELLO

Look, how he laughs already!

IAGO

I never knew a woman love man so.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.

OTHELLO

Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.

IAGO

CASSIO
OTHELLO
Do you hear, Cassio?

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
                  Now he importunes him
To tell it o'er. Go to; well said, well said.

IAGO

CASSIO
OTHELLO
She gives it out that you shall marry her.
Do you intend it?

CASSIO

IAGO
OTHELLO
Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

IAGO
CASSIO
Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.

IAGO

CASSIO
OTHELLO
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

CASSIO

OTHELLO
Prithee, say true.

I am a very villain else.

2
IAGO
CASSIO
Have you scored me? Well.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my
promise.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and
thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus
about my neck-

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
it.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
me. Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
Well, I must leave her company.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Before me! look where she comes.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA
3
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to
take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work that
you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it
there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?
There, give it your hobbyhorse. Wheresoever you had it, I'll take
out no work on't.

CASSIO
3
IAGO
OTHELLO
BIANCA
How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

OTHELLO
3
IAGO
CASSIO
BIANCA
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

BIANCA
3
IAGO
OTHELLO
CASSIO
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
come when you are next prepared for.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
After her, after her.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Will you sup there?

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
Faith, I intend so.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
with you.

CASSIO
2
IAGO
OTHELLO
Prithee, come; will you?

IAGO
2
OTHELLO
CASSIO
Go to; say no more.

OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
[Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
O Iago!

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
And did you see the handkerchief?

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Was that mine?

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair
woman! a sweet woman!

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Nay, you must forget that.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it,
and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature.
She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Nay, that's not your way.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
needle, an admirable musician. O, she will sing the savageness
out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention-

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
She's the worse for all this.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a
condition!

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Ay, too gentle.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
O, 'tis foul in her.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
With mine officer!

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
That's fouler.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate
with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This
night, Iago.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
she hath contaminated.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more
by midnight.

OTHELLO
2
IAGO
CASSIO
Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that
same?

IAGO
2
CASSIO
OTHELLO
Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
Come from the Duke. And, see your wife is with him.

LODOVICO
3
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
God save the worthy general!

OTHELLO
3
IAGO
CASSIO
LODOVICO
                              With all my heart, sir.

LODOVICO
3
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.

OTHELLO
3
IAGO
CASSIO
LODOVICO
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

IAGO
4
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
I am very glad to see you, signior;
Welcome to Cyprus.

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

IAGO
4
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
Lives, sir.

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breech; but you shall make all well.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
Are you sure of that?

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
My lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
[Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you will-"

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
A most unhappy one. I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
Fire and brimstone!

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
My lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
Are you wise?

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
What, is he angry?

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                    May be the letter moved him;
For, as I think, they do command him home,
Deputing Cassio in his government.

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
By my troth, I am glad on't.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
                               Indeed!

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
                                     My lord?

OTHELLO

IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
I am glad to see you mad.

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
                        Why, sweet Othello?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
Devil!                                        Strikes her.

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
I have not deserved this.

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
Though I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much.
Make her amends; she weeps.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
                     O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
[Going.] I will not stay to offend you.

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Truly, an obedient lady.
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
Mistress!

DESDEMONA
4
IAGO
CASSIO
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
My lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
What would you with her, sir?

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                             Who, I, my lord?

OTHELLO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
LODOVICO
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on,
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir- O well-painted passion!-
I am commanded home. Get you away;
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
I do entreat that we may sup together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate
Call all in all sufficient? This the nature
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
The shot of accident nor dart of chance
Could neither graze nor pierce?

IAGO
4
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
                            He is much changed.

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?

IAGO
4
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure
What he might be: if what he might he is not,
I would to heaven he were!

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                   What, strike his wife!

IAGO
4
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst!

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                           Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood,
And new create this fault?

IAGO
4
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
LODOVICO
                       Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech. Do but go after,
And mark how he continues.

LODOVICO
4
IAGO
CASSIO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.             Exeunt.

OTHELLO
0
You have seen nothing, then?

EMILIA
1
OTHELLO
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

EMILIA
1
OTHELLO
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
What, did they never whisper?

EMILIA
1
OTHELLO
                               Never, my lord.

OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
Nor send you out o' the way?

EMILIA
1
OTHELLO
Never.

OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

EMILIA
1
OTHELLO
Never, my lord.

OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
That's strange.

EMILIA
1
OTHELLO
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
             Bid her come hither; go.

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
My lord, what is your will?

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                              Pray, chuck, come hither.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
What is your pleasure?

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                         Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
        What horrible fancy's this?

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
[To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
Cough, or cry "hem," if anybody come.
Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch.

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words,
But not the words.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Why, what art thou?

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Come, swear it, damn thyself;
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn'd;
Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
              Heaven doth truly know it.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
O Desdemona! Away! away! away!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                   Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction, had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well;
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
Where either I must live or bear no life;
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,
Ay, there, look grim as hell!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write "whore" upon? What committed?
Committed? O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;
The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
And will not hear it. What committed?
Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
          By heaven, you do me wrong.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Are not you a strumpet?

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
                      No, as I am a Christian.
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
What, not a whore?

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
                 No, as I shall be saved.

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Is't possible?

DESDEMONA
2
EMILIA
OTHELLO
O, heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                        I cry you mercy then;
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
And keep the gate of hell!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains.
I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Faith, half asleep.

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
With who?

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
Why, with my lord, madam.

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Who is thy lord?

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
                    He that is yours, sweet lady.

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep, nor answer have I none
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember,
And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA
1
DESDEMONA
                       Here's a change indeed!

DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might have chid me so, for in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                     What's the matter, lady?

EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
Am I that name, Iago?

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                           What name, fair lady?

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
Such as she says my lord did say I was.

EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Why did he so?

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? Would it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
It is my wretched fortune.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                                Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
                      Nay, heaven doth know.

EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company?
What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
                            Speak within door.

EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
You are a fool; go to.

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
                  O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form,
Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
And ever will, though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say "whore."
It doth abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
The business of the state does him offense,
And he does chide with you.

DESDEMONA
2
IAGO
EMILIA
If 'twere no other-

IAGO
2
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO
3
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

IAGO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
RODERIGO
What in the contrary?

RODERIGO
3
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency
than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed
no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace
what already I have foolishly suffered.

RODERIGO

IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona
would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath
received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance; but I find none.

Very well.

RODERIGO

Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this

me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just
exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy

in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than
ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it; if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from
this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.

Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?

Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
Cassio in Othello's place.

RODERIGO

IAGO

Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
to Venice.

IAGO

EMILIA
DESDEMONA
RODERIGO
O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some
accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
Cassio.

RODERIGO
3
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
How do you mean, removing of him?

IAGO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
RODERIGO
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
his brains.

RODERIGO
3
IAGO
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
And that you would have me to do?

IAGO
3
EMILIA
DESDEMONA
RODERIGO
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows
not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going
thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and
one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second
your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not
amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a
necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to
waste. About it.

My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her. She had a song of "willow";

And she died singing it. That song tonight
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.

Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall; say that they slack their duties
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite,
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is. And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too. And have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well; else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
As gifts to Desdemona;
It must not be. If Cassio do remain,

CASSIO
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia, run you to the citadel,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!
Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.                 Exeunt.

OTHELLO

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore,
Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
I cannot give it vital growth again,
It must needs wither; I'll smell it on the tree.      Kisses her.
O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more;
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
And love thee after. One more, and this the last;
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly,
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

DESDEMONA

OTHELLO

If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
Solicit for it straight.

DESDEMONA

OTHELLO
Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?

OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.
No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

DESDEMONA

OTHELLO

OTHELLO

Hum!

DESDEMONA

And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

OTHELLO

DESDEMONA

OTHELLO

Ay, and for that thou diest.

DESDEMONA

That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.

OTHELLO

                  Peace, and be still!

Thou gavest to Cassio.

DESDEMONA

OTHELLO
              No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.

OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
                        Sweet soul, take heed,
Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.

DESDEMONA
1
OTHELLO
Ay, but not yet to die.

OTHELLO
1
DESDEMONA
                          Yes, presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

DESDEMONA
1
OTHELLO
Then Lord have mercy on me!

OTHELLO
1
DESDEMONA
                              I say, amen.

DESDEMONA
1
OTHELLO
And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love. I never gave him token.

OTHELLO
1
DESDEMONA
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
O perjured woman! Thou dost stone my heart,
And makest me call what I intend to do
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
I saw the handkerchief.

DESDEMONA
1
OTHELLO
               He found it then;
I never gave it him. Send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.

OTHELLO

                  He hath confess'd.

DESDEMONA

Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?
I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife.

Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe

Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
And here another. The one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo.

Now here's another discontented paper,
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
But that, belike, Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him.

There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came
That I was cast. And even but now he spake
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.

You must forsake this room, and go with us.
Your power and your command is taken off,
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
If there be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long,
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.

Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
And smote him, thus.                               Stabs himself.
