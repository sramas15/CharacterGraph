RODERIGO
0
Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly
IAGO
0
'Sblood, but you will not hear me.
RODERIGO
0
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
IAGO
0
Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
RODERIGO
0
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
IAGO
0
Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service,
RODERIGO
0
          I would not follow him then.
IAGO
0
O, sir, content you.
RODERIGO
0
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,
IAGO
0
                    Call up her father,
RODERIGO
0
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
IAGO
0
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
RODERIGO
0
What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
IAGO
0
Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!
BRABANTIO
0
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
RODERIGO
0
Signior, is all your family within?
IAGO
0
Are your doors lock'd?
BRABANTIO
0
                  Why? Wherefore ask you this?
IAGO
0
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd! For shame, put on your gown;
BRABANTIO
0
What, have you lost your wits?
RODERIGO
0
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
BRABANTIO
0
Not I. What are you?
RODERIGO
0
My name is Roderigo.
BRABANTIO
0
                    The worser welcome.
RODERIGO
0
Sir, sir, sir-
BRABANTIO
0
              But thou must needs be sure
RODERIGO
0
                     Patience, good sir.
BRABANTIO
0
What tell'st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;
RODERIGO
0
                  Most grave Brabantio,
IAGO
0
'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God,
BRABANTIO
0
What profane wretch art thou?
IAGO
0
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the
BRABANTIO
0
Thou are a villain.
IAGO
0
                         You are- a senator.
BRABANTIO
0
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
RODERIGO
0
Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you,
BRABANTIO
0
              Strike on the tinder, ho!
IAGO
0
                 Farewell, for I must leave you.
BRABANTIO
0
It is too true an evil: gone she is,
RODERIGO
0
Truly, I think they are.
BRABANTIO
0
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
RODERIGO
0
            Yes, sir, I have indeed.
BRABANTIO
0
Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
RODERIGO
0
I think I can discover him, if you please
BRABANTIO
0
Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
IAGO
0
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
OTHELLO
0
'Tis better as it is.
IAGO
0
                         Nay, but he prated
OTHELLO
0
              Let him do his spite.
IAGO
0
Those are the raised father and his friends.
OTHELLO
0
              Not I; I must be found.
IAGO
0
By Janus, I think no.
OTHELLO
0
The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant?
CASSIO
0
            The Duke does greet you, general,
OTHELLO
0
              What is the matter, think you?
CASSIO
0
Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
OTHELLO
0
            'Tis well I am found by you.
CASSIO
0
           Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO
0
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;
CASSIO
0
I do not understand.
IAGO
0
                       He's married.
CASSIO

OTHELLO
                                   To who?
IAGO
1
OTHELLO
Marry, to- Come, captain, will you go?
OTHELLO
1
OTHELLO
                                    Have with you.
CASSIO
1
OTHELLO
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
IAGO
1
OTHELLO
It is Brabantio. General, be advised,
OTHELLO
1
OTHELLO
                 Holla! Stand there!
RODERIGO
1
OTHELLO
Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO
1
OTHELLO
                        Down with him, thief!
IAGO
1
OTHELLO
You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.
OTHELLO
1
OTHELLO
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
BRABANTIO
1
OTHELLO
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
OTHELLO
1
OTHELLO
                  Hold your hands,
BRABANTIO
1
OTHELLO
                   To prison, till fit time
OTHELLO
1
OTHELLO
              What if I do obey?
FIRST OFFICER
1
OTHELLO
       'Tis true, most worthy signior;
BRABANTIO
1
OTHELLO
               How? The Duke in council?
DUKE
0
There is no composition in these news
FIRST SENATOR
0
           Indeed they are disproportion'd;
DUKE
0
And mine, a hundred and forty.
SECOND SENATOR
0
                     And mine, two hundred.
DUKE
0
Nay, it is possible enough to judgement.
SAILOR
0
[Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!
FIRST OFFICER
0
A messenger from the galleys.
DUKE
0
                               Now, what's the business?
SAILOR
0
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,
DUKE
0
How say you by this change?
FIRST SENATOR
0
                   This cannot be,
DUKE
0
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
FIRST OFFICER
0
Here is more news.
MESSENGER
0
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
FIRST SENATOR
0
Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
MESSENGER
0
Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem
DUKE
0
'Tis certain then for Cyprus.
FIRST SENATOR
0
He's now in Florence.
DUKE
0
Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch.
FIRST SENATOR
0
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
DUKE
0
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
BRABANTIO
0
So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me:
DUKE
0
                    Why, what's the matter?
BRABANTIO
0
My daughter! O, my daughter!
ALL
0
                                   Dead?
BRABANTIO
0
                                   Ay, to me.
DUKE
0
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
BRABANTIO
0
             Humbly I thank your Grace.
ALL
0
                  We are very sorry for't.
DUKE
0
[To Othello.] What in your own part can you say to this?
BRABANTIO
0
Nothing, but this is so.
OTHELLO
0
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
BRABANTIO
0
           A maiden never bold,
DUKE
0
                 To vouch this is no proof,
FIRST SENATOR
0
But, Othello, speak.
OTHELLO
0
                    I do beseech you,
DUKE
0
                    Fetch Desdemona hither.
OTHELLO
0
Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
DUKE
0
Say it, Othello.
OTHELLO
0
Her father loved me, oft invited me,
DUKE
0
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
BRABANTIO
0
              I pray you, hear her speak.
DESDEMONA
0
                     My noble father,
BRABANTIO
0
                 God be with you! I have done.
DUKE
0
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence
BRABANTIO
0
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
DUKE
0
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
OTHELLO
0
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
DUKE
0
                         If you please,
BRABANTIO
0
             I'll not have it so.
OTHELLO
0
Nor I.
DESDEMONA
0
     Nor I. I would not there reside
DUKE
0
What would you, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA
0
That I did love the Moor to live with him,
OTHELLO
0
Let her have your voices.
DUKE
0
Be it as you shall privately determine,
DESDEMONA
0
Tonight, my lord?
DUKE
0
                       This night.
OTHELLO
0
                                With all my heart.
DUKE
0
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
OTHELLO
0
             So please your Grace, my ancient;
DUKE
0
                 Let it be so.
FIRST SENATOR
0
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
BRABANTIO
0
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;
OTHELLO
0
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
RODERIGO
0
Iago!
IAGO
0
What say'st thou, noble heart?
RODERIGO
0
What will I do, thinkest thou?
IAGO
0
Why, go to bed and sleep.
RODERIGO
0
I will incontinently drown myself.
IAGO
0
If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
RODERIGO
0
It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
IAGO
0
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
RODERIGO
0
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
IAGO
0
Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
RODERIGO
0
It cannot be.
IAGO
0
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
RODERIGO
0
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
IAGO
0
Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
RODERIGO
0
Where shall we meet i' the morning?
IAGO
0
At my lodging.
RODERIGO
0
I'll be with thee betimes.
IAGO
0
Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
RODERIGO
0
What say you?
IAGO
0
No more of drowning, do you hear?
RODERIGO
0
I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.
IAGO
0
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
MONTANO
0
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
0
Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;
MONTANO
0
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
MONTANO
0
                If that the Turkish fleet
THIRD GENTLEMAN
0
News, lads! Our wars are done.
MONTANO
0
How? Is this true?
THIRD GENTLEMAN
0
           The ship is here put in,
MONTANO
0
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
THIRD GENTLEMAN
0
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
MONTANO
0
                        Pray heavens he be,
THIRD GENTLEMAN
0
Come, let's do so,
CASSIO
0
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
MONTANO
0
I she well shipp'd?
CASSIO
0
His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
FOURTH GENTLEMAN
0
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
CASSIO
0
My hopes do shape him for the governor.
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
CASSIO
0
                I pray you, sir, go forth,
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
I shall.                                    Exit.
MONTANO
0
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
CASSIO
0
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
CASSIO
0
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
CASSIO
0
He has had most favorable and happy speed:
MONTANO
0
               What is she?
CASSIO
0
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
DESDEMONA
0
           I thank you, valiant Cassio.
CASSIO
0
He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught
DESDEMONA
0
O, but I fear- How lost you company?
CASSIO
0
The great contention of the sea and skies
SECOND GENTLEMAN
0
They give their greeting to the citadel;
CASSIO
0
                     See for the news.
IAGO
0
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
DESDEMONA
0
           Alas, she has no speech.
IAGO
0
In faith, too much;
EMILIA
0
You have little cause to say so.
IAGO
0
Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,
DESDEMONA
0
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
IAGO
0
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
EMILIA
0
You shall not write my praise.
IAGO
0
                                 No, let me not.
DESDEMONA
0
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
IAGO
0
O gentle lady, do not put me to't,
DESDEMONA
0
Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?
IAGO
0
Ay, madam.
DESDEMONA
0
I am not merry, but I do beguile
IAGO
0
I am about it, but indeed my invention
DESDEMONA
0
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
IAGO
0
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
DESDEMONA
0
Worse and worse.
EMILIA
0
How if fair and foolish?
IAGO
0
She never yet was foolish that was fair,
DESDEMONA
0
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the
IAGO
0
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
DESDEMONA
0
O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what
IAGO
0
She that was ever fair and never proud,
DESDEMONA
0
To do what?
IAGO
0
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
DESDEMONA
0
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,
CASSIO
0
He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the
IAGO
0
[Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.
CASSIO
0
'Tis truly so.
DESDEMONA
0
Let's meet him and receive him.
CASSIO
0
Lo, where he comes!
OTHELLO
0
O my fair warrior!
DESDEMONA
0
                 My dear Othello!
OTHELLO
0
It gives me wonder great as my content
DESDEMONA
0
                 The heavens forbid
OTHELLO
0
                   Amen to that, sweet powers!
IAGO
0
                    [Aside.] O, you are well tuned now!
OTHELLO
0
            Come, let us to the castle.
IAGO
0
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou
RODERIGO
0
With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
IAGO
0
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me
RODERIGO
0
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest
IAGO
0
Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If
RODERIGO
0
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
IAGO
0
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the
RODERIGO
0
Well.
IAGO
0
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may
RODERIGO
0
I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
IAGO
0
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must

0
Adieu.                                              Exit.
IAGO
0
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
HERALD
0
It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,
OTHELLO
0
Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
CASSIO
0
Iago hath direction what to do;
OTHELLO
0
           Iago is most honest.
CASSIO
0
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
IAGO
0
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our
CASSIO
0
She's a most exquisite lady.
IAGO
0
And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
CASSIO
0
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
IAGO
0
What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
CASSIO
0
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
IAGO
0
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
CASSIO
0
She is indeed perfection.
IAGO
0
Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
CASSIO
0
Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains
IAGO
0
O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
CASSIO
0
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily
IAGO
0
What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
CASSIO
0
Where are they?
IAGO
0
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
CASSIO
0
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.
IAGO
0
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
IAGO
1
CASSIO
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
CASSIO

CASSIO
'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
MONTANO

CASSIO
Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a

Some wine, ho!

'Fore God, an excellent song.
IAGO

CASSIO
I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in

Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
IAGO

CASSIO
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he

MONTANO
1
CASSIO
I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
O sweet England!
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Will you hear't again?
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
IAGO
1
CASSIO
It's true, good lieutenant.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man
IAGO
1
CASSIO
And so do I too, lieutenant.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
ALL

CASSIO
Excellent well.
CASSIO

CASSIO
Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
MONTANO
0
To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
IAGO
0
You see this fellow that is gone before;
MONTANO
0
                 But is he often thus?
IAGO
0
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
MONTANO
0
                       It were well
IAGO
0
[Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
MONTANO

And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
IAGO

            Not I, for this fair island.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
            Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"
CASSIO

CASSIO
'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!
MONTANO

CASSIO
What's the matter, lieutenant?
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a

CASSIO
Beat me!
CASSIO

CASSIO
Dost thou prate, rogue?                   Strikes Roderigo.
MONTANO
1
CASSIO
Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
MONTANO
1
CASSIO
Come, come, you're drunk.
CASSIO

CASSIO
Drunk?                                          They fight.

    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;

Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,

He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?

But for a satisfaction of my thought;
OTHELLO

          Why of thy thought, Iago?

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,

You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;

Ha!
IAGO

       O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
OTHELLO

O misery!
IAGO

Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
OTHELLO

        Why, why is this?
IAGO

I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
OTHELLO

Dost thou say so?
IAGO

She did deceive her father, marrying you;
OTHELLO

              And so she did.
IAGO

                                 Why, go to then.
OTHELLO

                  I am bound to thee forever.

Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
OTHELLO

And yet, how nature erring from itself-

Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-

This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
DESDEMONA

           How now, my dear Othello!

Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.

EMILIA

DESDEMONA
I am glad I have found this napkin;
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
How now, what do you here alone?
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
A thing for me? It is a common thing-
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
Ha!
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
To have a foolish wife.
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
O, is that all? What will you give me now
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
                        What handkerchief?
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
What handkerchief?
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
Hast stol'n it from her?
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
              A good wench; give it me.
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
[Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
EMILIA
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
If't be not for some purpose of import,
IAGO
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
IAGO
1
DESDEMONA
Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.

Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                      Ha, ha, false to me?
IAGO

Why, how now, general! No more of that.
OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
IAGO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                         How now, my lord?
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
IAGO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I am sorry to hear this.
OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I had been happy if the general camp,
IAGO

OTHELLO
Is't possible, my lord?
OTHELLO

OTHELLO
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
IAGO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                        Is't come to this?
OTHELLO

Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
IAGO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
My noble lord-
OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
               O grace! O heaven defend me!
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                      By the world,
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                 Would? Nay, I will.
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
            Death and damnation! O!
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I do not like the office;
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
O monstrous! monstrous!
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                           Nay, this was but his dream.
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
IAGO

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
And this may help to thicken other proofs

                     I'll tear her all to pieces.
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                         If it be that-
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
If it be that, or any that was hers,
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                         Yet be content.
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
O, blood, blood, blood!
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                    Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
                    I greet thy love,
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
OTHELLO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
           Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
IAGO
2
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
DESDEMONA
0
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
CLOWN
0
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
DESDEMONA
0
Why, man?
CLOWN
0
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
DESDEMONA
0
Go to! Where lodges he?
CLOWN
0
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
DESDEMONA
0
Can anything be made of this?
CLOWN
0
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
DESDEMONA
0
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
CLOWN
0
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
DESDEMONA
0
Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
CLOWN
0
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
DESDEMONA
0
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
EMILIA
0
I know not, madam.
DESDEMONA
0
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
EMILIA
0
                      Is he not jealous?
DESDEMONA
0
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
EMILIA
0
                         Look, where he comes.
DESDEMONA
0
I will not leave him now till Cassio
OTHELLO
0
Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
DESDEMONA
0
              Well, my good lord.
OTHELLO
0
Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
DESDEMONA
0
It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
OTHELLO
0
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
DESDEMONA
0
You may, indeed, say so;
OTHELLO
0
A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
DESDEMONA
0
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
OTHELLO
0
What promise, chuck?
DESDEMONA
0
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
OTHELLO
0
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
DESDEMONA
0
Here, my lord.
OTHELLO
0
That which I gave you.
DESDEMONA
0
I have it not about me.
OTHELLO
0
Not?
DESDEMONA
0
No, faith, my lord.
OTHELLO
0
That's a fault. That handkerchief
DESDEMONA
0
                    Is't possible?
OTHELLO
0
'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
DESDEMONA
0
                     Indeed! is't true?
OTHELLO
0
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
DESDEMONA
0
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
OTHELLO
0
Ha! wherefore?
DESDEMONA
0
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
OTHELLO
0
Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
DESDEMONA
0
Heaven bless us!
OTHELLO
0
Say you?
DESDEMONA
0
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
OTHELLO
0
How?
DESDEMONA
0
I say, it is not lost.
OTHELLO
0
Fetch't, let me see it.
DESDEMONA
0
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
OTHELLO
0
Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
DESDEMONA
0
Come, come,
OTHELLO
0
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA
0
                I pray, talk me of Cassio.
OTHELLO
0
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA
0
                A man that all his time
OTHELLO
0
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA
0
In sooth, you are to blame.
OTHELLO
0
Away!                                                Exit.
EMILIA
0
Is not this man jealous?
DESDEMONA
0
I ne'er saw this before.
EMILIA
0
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
IAGO
0
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
DESDEMONA
0
How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
CASSIO
0
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
DESDEMONA
0
          Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
IAGO
0
Is my lord angry?
EMILIA
0
                He went hence but now,
IAGO
0
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
DESDEMONA
0
I prithee, do so.                             Exit Iago.
EMILIA
0
Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
DESDEMONA
0
Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
EMILIA
0
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
DESDEMONA
0
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
EMILIA
0
Lady, amen.
DESDEMONA
0
I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout.
CASSIO
0
I humbly thank your ladyship.
BIANCA
0
Save you, friend Cassio!
CASSIO
0
                         What make you from home?
BIANCA
0
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
CASSIO
0
             Pardon me, Bianca.
BIANCA
0
                 O Cassio, whence came this?
CASSIO
0
                         Go to, woman!
BIANCA
0
                   Why, whose is it?
CASSIO
0
I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.
BIANCA
0
Leave you! wherefore?
CASSIO
0
I do attend here on the general;
BIANCA
0
                      Why, I pray you?
CASSIO
0
Not that I love you not.
BIANCA
0
                         But that you do not love me.
CASSIO
0
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
BIANCA
0
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.            Exeunt.
IAGO
0
Will you think so?
OTHELLO
0
                Think so, Iago?
IAGO
0
                                   What,
OTHELLO
0
             An unauthorized kiss.
IAGO
0
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
OTHELLO
0
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
IAGO
0
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
OTHELLO
0
What then?
IAGO
0
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
OTHELLO
0
She is protectress of her honor too.
IAGO
0
Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
OTHELLO
0
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
IAGO
0
Ay, what of that?
OTHELLO
0
               That's not so good now.
IAGO
0
                                          What,
OTHELLO
0
             Hath he said anything?
IAGO
0
He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
OTHELLO
0
                     What hath he said?
IAGO
0
Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
OTHELLO
0
What? what?
IAGO
0
Lie-
OTHELLO
0
With her?
IAGO
0
             With her, on her, what you will.
OTHELLO
0
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they
IAGO
0
Work on,
CASSIO
0
What's the matter?
IAGO
0
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
CASSIO
0
Rub him about the temples.
IAGO
0
                             No, forbear;
OTHELLO
0
Dost thou mock me?
IAGO
0
                      I mock you? No, by heaven.
OTHELLO
0
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
IAGO
0
There's many a beast then in a populous city,
OTHELLO
0
Did he confess it?
IAGO
0
                      Good sir, be a man;
OTHELLO
0
O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
IAGO
0
                                   Stand you awhile apart,
OTHELLO
0
               Dost thou hear, Iago?
IAGO
0
                               That's not amiss;
IAGO
1
CASSIO
                               That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
The worser that you give me the addition
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
                        Alas, poor caitiff!
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Look, how he laughs already!
IAGO
1
CASSIO
I never knew a woman love man so.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Do you hear, Cassio?
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
                  Now he importunes him
IAGO
1
CASSIO
She gives it out that you shall marry her.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Prithee, say true.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
I am a very villain else.
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Have you scored me? Well.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Well, I must leave her company.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Before me! look where she comes.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
BIANCA
1
CASSIO
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
OTHELLO
1
CASSIO
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
BIANCA
1
CASSIO
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
IAGO
1
CASSIO
After her, after her.
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Will you sup there?
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Faith, I intend so.
IAGO
1
CASSIO
Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
CASSIO
1
CASSIO
Prithee, come; will you?
IAGO
0
Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
OTHELLO
0
[Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
IAGO
0
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
OTHELLO
0
O Iago!
IAGO
0
And did you see the handkerchief?
OTHELLO
0
Was that mine?
IAGO
0
Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
OTHELLO
0
I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair
IAGO
0
Nay, you must forget that.
OTHELLO
0
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
IAGO
0
Nay, that's not your way.
OTHELLO
0
Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
IAGO
0
She's the worse for all this.
OTHELLO
0
O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a
IAGO
0
Ay, too gentle.
OTHELLO
0
Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
IAGO
0
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
OTHELLO
0
I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
IAGO
0
O, 'tis foul in her.
OTHELLO
0
With mine officer!
IAGO
0
That's fouler.
OTHELLO
0
Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate
IAGO
0
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
OTHELLO
0
Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
IAGO
0
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more
OTHELLO
0
Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that
IAGO
0
Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
LODOVICO
0
God save the worthy general!
OTHELLO
0
                              With all my heart, sir.
LODOVICO
0
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.
OTHELLO
0
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
DESDEMONA
0
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
IAGO
0
I am very glad to see you, signior;
LODOVICO
0
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
IAGO
0
Lives, sir.
DESDEMONA
0
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
OTHELLO
0
Are you sure of that?
DESDEMONA
0
My lord?
OTHELLO
0
[Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you will-"
LODOVICO
0
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
DESDEMONA
0
A most unhappy one. I would do much
OTHELLO
0
Fire and brimstone!
DESDEMONA
0
My lord?
OTHELLO
0
Are you wise?
DESDEMONA
0
What, is he angry?
LODOVICO
0
                    May be the letter moved him;
DESDEMONA
0
By my troth, I am glad on't.
OTHELLO
0
                               Indeed!
DESDEMONA
0
                                     My lord?
OTHELLO
0
I am glad to see you mad.
DESDEMONA
0
                        Why, sweet Othello?
OTHELLO
0
Devil!                                        Strikes her.
DESDEMONA
0
I have not deserved this.
LODOVICO
0
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
OTHELLO
0
                     O devil, devil!
DESDEMONA
0
[Going.] I will not stay to offend you.
LODOVICO
0
Truly, an obedient lady.
OTHELLO
0
Mistress!
DESDEMONA
0
My lord?
OTHELLO
0
What would you with her, sir?
LODOVICO
0
                             Who, I, my lord?
OTHELLO
0
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
LODOVICO
0
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate
IAGO
0
                            He is much changed.
LODOVICO
0
Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?
IAGO
0
He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure
LODOVICO
0
                   What, strike his wife!
IAGO
0
Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
LODOVICO
0
                           Is it his use?
IAGO
0
                       Alas, alas!
LODOVICO
0
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.             Exeunt.
OTHELLO
0
You have seen nothing, then?
EMILIA
0
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
OTHELLO
0
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
EMILIA
0
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
OTHELLO
0
What, did they never whisper?
EMILIA
0
                               Never, my lord.
OTHELLO
0
Nor send you out o' the way?
EMILIA
0
Never.
OTHELLO
0
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
EMILIA
0
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO
0
That's strange.
EMILIA
0
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
OTHELLO
0
             Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
DESDEMONA
0
My lord, what is your will?
OTHELLO
0
                              Pray, chuck, come hither.
DESDEMONA
0
What is your pleasure?
OTHELLO
0
                         Let me see your eyes;
DESDEMONA
0
        What horrible fancy's this?
OTHELLO
0
[To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,
DESDEMONA
0
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
OTHELLO
0
Why, what art thou?
DESDEMONA
0
Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
OTHELLO
0
Come, swear it, damn thyself;
DESDEMONA
0
              Heaven doth truly know it.
OTHELLO
0
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
DESDEMONA
0
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
OTHELLO
0
O Desdemona! Away! away! away!
DESDEMONA
0
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
OTHELLO
0
                   Had it pleased heaven
DESDEMONA
0
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
OTHELLO
0
O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
DESDEMONA
0
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
OTHELLO
0
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
DESDEMONA
0
          By heaven, you do me wrong.
OTHELLO
0
Are not you a strumpet?
DESDEMONA
0
                      No, as I am a Christian.
OTHELLO
0
What, not a whore?
DESDEMONA
0
                 No, as I shall be saved.
OTHELLO
0
Is't possible?
DESDEMONA
0
O, heaven forgive us!
OTHELLO
0
                        I cry you mercy then;
OTHELLO
1
EMILIA
                        I cry you mercy then;
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Faith, half asleep.
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
With who?
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
Why, with my lord, madam.
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Who is thy lord?
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
                    He that is yours, sweet lady.
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
                       Here's a change indeed!
DESDEMONA
0
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
IAGO
1
EMILIA
What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
IAGO
1
EMILIA
                     What's the matter, lady?
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Am I that name, Iago?
IAGO
1
EMILIA
                           What name, fair lady?
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Why did he so?
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
It is my wretched fortune.
IAGO
1
EMILIA
                                Beshrew him for't!
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
                      Nay, heaven doth know.
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
IAGO
1
EMILIA
                            Speak within door.
EMILIA
1
EMILIA
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
IAGO
1
EMILIA
You are a fool; go to.
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
                  O good Iago,
IAGO
1
EMILIA
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
DESDEMONA
1
EMILIA
If 'twere no other-
IAGO
1
EMILIA
'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
IAGO
1
EMILIA
'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
IAGO
1
EMILIA
What in the contrary?
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
IAGO
1
EMILIA
You charge me most unjustly.
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Well, go to, very well.
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Very well.
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
IAGO
1
EMILIA
You have said now.
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
It hath not appeared.
IAGO
1
EMILIA
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
IAGO
1
EMILIA
O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
How do you mean, removing of him?
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
And that you would have me to do?
IAGO
1
EMILIA
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
RODERIGO
1
EMILIA
I will hear further reason for this.
IAGO
1
EMILIA
And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.
LODOVICO
0
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
OTHELLO
0
O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
LODOVICO
0
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
DESDEMONA
0
Your honor is most welcome.
OTHELLO
0
                              Will you walk, sir?
DESDEMONA
0
My lord?
OTHELLO
0
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
DESDEMONA
0
I will, my lord.
EMILIA
0
How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
DESDEMONA
0
He says he will return incontinent.
EMILIA
0
                      Dismiss me?
DESDEMONA
0
It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
EMILIA
0
I would you had never seen him!
DESDEMONA
0
So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
EMILIA
0
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
DESDEMONA
0
All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
EMILIA
0
                       Come, come, you talk.
DESDEMONA
0
My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
EMILIA
0
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
DESDEMONA
0
                              No, unpin me here.
EMILIA
0
A very handsome man.
DESDEMONA
0
He speaks well.
EMILIA
0
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
DESDEMONA
0
[Sings.]
EMILIA
0
It's the wind.
DESDEMONA
0
[Sings.]
EMILIA
0
                  'Tis neither here nor there.
DESDEMONA
0
I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
EMILIA
0
              There be some such, no question.
DESDEMONA
0
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
EMILIA
0
Why, would not you?
DESDEMONA
0
                 No, by this heavenly light!
EMILIA
0
Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
DESDEMONA
0
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
EMILIA
0
The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
DESDEMONA
0
         In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
EMILIA
0
In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
DESDEMONA
0
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
EMILIA
0
Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
DESDEMONA
0
I do not think there is any such woman.
EMILIA
0
Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
DESDEMONA
0
Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
IAGO
0
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
RODERIGO
0
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
IAGO
0
Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
Retires
0
RODERIGO
0
I have no great devotion to the deed;
IAGO
0
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
RODERIGO
0
I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
CASSIO
0
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
RODERIGO
0
                    O, I am slain!
CASSIO
0
I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
OTHELLO
0
The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
RODERIGO
0
O, villain that I am!
OTHELLO
0
                       It is even so.
CASSIO
0
O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
OTHELLO
0
'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
CASSIO
0
What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!
GRATIANO
0
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
CASSIO
0
O, help!
LODOVICO
0
Hark!
RODERIGO
0
O wretched villain!
LODOVICO
0
Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
RODERIGO
0
Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
LODOVICO
1
IAGO
Hark!
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
IAGO
1
IAGO
Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
LODOVICO
1
IAGO
We do not know.
IAGO
1
IAGO
                    Did not you hear a cry?
CASSIO
1
IAGO
Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
IAGO
1
IAGO
                                      What's the matter?
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
LODOVICO
1
IAGO
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
IAGO
1
IAGO
What are you here that cry so grievously?
CASSIO
1
IAGO
Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
IAGO
1
IAGO
O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
CASSIO
1
IAGO
I think that one of them is hereabout,
IAGO
1
IAGO
                  O treacherous villains!
RODERIGO
1
IAGO
O, help me here!
CASSIO
1
IAGO
That's one of them.
IAGO
1
IAGO
                      O murtherous slave! O villain!
RODERIGO
1
IAGO
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
IAGO
1
IAGO
Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
LODOVICO
1
IAGO
As you shall prove us, praise us.
IAGO
1
IAGO
Signior Lodovico?
LODOVICO
1
IAGO
He, sir.
IAGO
1
IAGO
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
Cassio?
IAGO
1
IAGO
How is't, brother?
CASSIO
1
IAGO
My leg is cut in two.
IAGO
1
IAGO
                        Marry, heaven forbid!
BIANCA
1
IAGO
What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
IAGO
1
IAGO
Who is't that cried?
BIANCA
1
IAGO
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
IAGO
1
IAGO
O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
CASSIO
1
IAGO
No.
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
IAGO
1
IAGO
Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
BIANCA
1
IAGO
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
IAGO
1
IAGO
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
What, of Venice?
IAGO
1
IAGO
Even he, sir. Did you know him?
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
                            Know him! ay.
IAGO
1
IAGO
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
               I am glad to see you.
IAGO
1
IAGO
How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
GRATIANO
1
IAGO
Roderigo!
IAGO
1
IAGO
He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
CASSIO
1
IAGO
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
IAGO
1
IAGO
[To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
EMILIA
1
IAGO
'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
IAGO
1
IAGO
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
EMILIA
1
IAGO
Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
IAGO
1
IAGO
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
BIANCA
1
IAGO
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
IAGO
1
IAGO
O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
EMILIA
1
IAGO
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
BIANCA
1
IAGO
I am no strumpet, but of life as honest
EMILIA
1
IAGO
                     As I! foh! fie upon thee!
IAGO
1
IAGO
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
OTHELLO
0
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
DESDEMONA
0
Who's there? Othello?
OTHELLO
0
                        Ay, Desdemona.
DESDEMONA
0
Will you come to bed, my lord?
OTHELLO
0
Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA
0
Ay, my lord.
OTHELLO
0
If you bethink yourself of any crime
DESDEMONA
0
Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
OTHELLO
0
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.
DESDEMONA
0
Talk you of killing?
OTHELLO
0
Ay, I do.
DESDEMONA
0
Then heaven have mercy on me!
OTHELLO
0
Amen, with all my heart!
DESDEMONA
0
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
OTHELLO
0
Hum!
DESDEMONA
0
And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
OTHELLO
0
Think on thy sins.
DESDEMONA
0
                 They are loves I bear to you.
OTHELLO
0
Ay, and for that thou diest.
DESDEMONA
0
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
OTHELLO
0
                  Peace, and be still!
DESDEMONA
0
I will so. What's the matter?
OTHELLO
0
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
DESDEMONA
0
              No, by my life and soul!
OTHELLO
0
                        Sweet soul, take heed,
DESDEMONA
0
Ay, but not yet to die.
OTHELLO
0
                          Yes, presently:
DESDEMONA
0
Then Lord have mercy on me!
OTHELLO
0
                              I say, amen.
DESDEMONA
0
And have you mercy too! I never did
OTHELLO
0
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
DESDEMONA
0
               He found it then;
OTHELLO
0
                  He hath confess'd.
DESDEMONA
0
What, my lord?
OTHELLO
0
That he hath used thee.
DESDEMONA
0
                      How? unlawfully?
OTHELLO
0
Ay.
DESDEMONA
0
He will not say so.
OTHELLO
0
                      No, his mouth is stopp'd;
DESDEMONA
0
O, my fear interprets! What, is he dead?
OTHELLO
0
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
DESDEMONA
0
Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!
OTHELLO
0
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?
DESDEMONA
0
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
OTHELLO
0
Down, strumpet!
DESDEMONA
0
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
OTHELLO
0
Nay, if you strive-
DESDEMONA
0
But half an hour!
OTHELLO
0
                    Being done, there is no pause.
DESDEMONA
0
But while I say one prayer!
OTHELLO
0
                       It is too late.     He stifles her.
EMILIA
0
[Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO
0
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
EMILIA
0
[Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO
0
                                     Who's there?
EMILIA
0
[Within.] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
OTHELLO
0
Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
EMILIA
0
[Within.] I do beseech you
OTHELLO
0
I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.
EMILIA
0
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!
OTHELLO
0
What, now?
EMILIA
0
But now, my lord.
OTHELLO
0
It is the very error of the moon;
EMILIA
0
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
OTHELLO
0
          Roderigo kill'd?
EMILIA
0
             No, Cassio is not kill'd.
OTHELLO
0
Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,
DESDEMONA
0
O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
EMILIA
0
                                  Alas, what cry is that?
OTHELLO
0
That? what?
EMILIA
0
Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice.
DESDEMONA
0
A guiltless death I die.
EMILIA
0
O, who hath done this deed?
DESDEMONA
0
Nobody; I myself. Farewell;
OTHELLO
0
Why, how should she be murther'd?
EMILIA
0
                                   Alas, who knows?
OTHELLO
0
You heard her say herself, it was not I.
EMILIA
0
She said so; I must needs report the truth.
OTHELLO
0
She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
EMILIA
0
                   O, the more angel she,
OTHELLO
0
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
EMILIA
0
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
OTHELLO
0
She was false as water.
EMILIA
0
                         Thou art rash as fire, to say
OTHELLO
0
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
EMILIA
0
My husband?
OTHELLO
0
Thy husband.
EMILIA
0
That she was false to wedlock?
OTHELLO
0
Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
EMILIA
0
                         My husband?
OTHELLO
0
Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
EMILIA
0
                       My husband?
OTHELLO
0
What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
EMILIA
0
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
OTHELLO
0
                            He, woman;
EMILIA
0
If he say so, may his pernicious soul
OTHELLO
0
Ha!
EMILIA
0
Do thy worst;
OTHELLO
0
                    Peace, you were best.
EMILIA
0
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
MONTANO
0
What is the matter? How now, general?
EMILIA
0
O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,
GRATIANO
0
What is the matter?
EMILIA
0
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.
IAGO
0
I told him what I thought, and told no more
EMILIA
0
But did you ever tell him she was false?
IAGO
0
I did.
EMILIA
0
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
IAGO
0
With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
EMILIA
0
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
ALL
0
O heavens forfend!
EMILIA
0
And your reports have set the murther on.
OTHELLO
0
Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.
GRATIANO
0
'Tis a strange truth.
MONTANO
0
O monstrous act!
EMILIA
0
                  Villainy, villainy, villainy!
IAGO
0
What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
EMILIA
0
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;
OTHELLO
0
O! O! O!                                 Falls on the bed.
EMILIA
0
          Nay, lay thee down and roar;
OTHELLO
0
           [Rises.] O, she was foul!
GRATIANO
0
Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
OTHELLO
0
'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows
EMILIA
0
O heaven! O heavenly powers!
IAGO
0
'Zounds! Hold your peace.
EMILIA
0
                        'Twill out, 'twill. I peace?
IAGO
0
Be wise, and get you home.
EMILIA
0
                         I will not.
GRATIANO
0
                                   Fie!
EMILIA
0
O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak'st of
IAGO
0
                         Villainous whore!
EMILIA
0
She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
IAGO
0
                         Filth, thou liest!
EMILIA
0
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
OTHELLO
0
                 Are there not stones in heaven
GRATIANO
0
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
EMILIA
0
Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.          Exit Iago.
GRATIANO
0
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
MONTANO
0
'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
OTHELLO
0
                  I am not valiant neither,

         What did thy song bode, lady?
OTHELLO

I have another weapon in this chamber;
GRATIANO

[Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
OTHELLO

Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
OTHELLO

GRATIANO
Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
GRATIANO

GRATIANO
What is the matter?
OTHELLO

GRATIANO
                     Behold, I have a weapon;
LODOVICO

GRATIANO
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
That's he that was Othello. Here I am.
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
Wrench his sword from him.
IAGO

GRATIANO
                               I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
O thou Othello, that wert once so good,
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
                     Why, anything;
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
Ay.
CASSIO
1
GRATIANO
Dear general, I never gave you cause.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
IAGO
1
GRATIANO
Demand me nothing; what you know, you know.
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
What, not to pray?
GRATIANO
1
GRATIANO
                   Torments will ope your lips.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
Well, thou dost best.
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
O villain!
CASSIO
1
GRATIANO
            Most heathenish and most gross!
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
Now here's another discontented paper,
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
                    O the pernicious caitiff!
CASSIO
1
GRATIANO
              I found it in my chamber;
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
                      O fool! fool! fool!
CASSIO
1
GRATIANO
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
You must forsake this room, and go with us.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
Soft you; a word or two before you go.
LODOVICO
1
GRATIANO
O bloody period!
GRATIANO
1
GRATIANO
                 All that's spoke is marr'd.
OTHELLO
1
GRATIANO
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee. No way but this,
CASSIO
1
GRATIANO
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
LODOVICO

        [To Iago.] O Spartan dog,
