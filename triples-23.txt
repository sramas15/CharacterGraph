4
Sailor
Desdemona
Messenger
Brabantio
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have pass'd.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline;
    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively. I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
  DUKE.

    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

    Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.
    To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

  IAGO. 
4
Othello
Desdemona
Cassio
Roderigo
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
    Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:

    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;

Desdemona
Othello
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:

Desdemona
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
                                        Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
  EMILIA. 
1
Desdemona
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
2
Iago
Desdemona
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
  IAGO.

    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO.

Iago

Iago

  OTHELLO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona
Othello
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona
Othello
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona
Othello
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona

  OTHELLO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona

  OTHELLO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona
Othello
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona
Othello
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
3
Iago
Desdemona
Othello
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.

  CLOWN. 
1
Desdemona
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
Desdemona
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
1
Desdemona
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
1
Desdemona
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
1
Desdemona
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
Desdemona
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
1
Desdemona
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,

1
Desdemona
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
1
Desdemona

Desdemona

Desdemona
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA.

Desdemona

  EMILIA.

Desdemona

  DESDEMONA. 
2
Desdemona
Othello
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
2
Desdemona
Othello
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;

Desdemona
Othello
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
2
Desdemona
Othello
HELLO. What promise, chuck?

Desdemona
Othello
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

  OTHELLO.

Desdemona
Othello
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA.

Desdemona
Othello
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO.

Desdemona

Cassio
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,

    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
    No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.

  IAGO.

GO. By Janus, I think no.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant?

HELLO.               What is the matter, think you?
  CASSIO.

ABANTIO.                How? The Duke in council?
  DUKE.

KE. There is no composition in these news

  SECOND

COND SENATOR.                      And mine, two hundred.

  SAILOR.

  FIRST

RST SENATOR.                    This cannot be,

RST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
  DUKE.

KE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
  BRABANTIO.

ABANTIO. So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me:
  DUKE.

  ALL.

L.                   We are very sorry for't.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. [To Othello.] What in your own part can you say to this?
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  To vouch this is no proof,
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I do beseech you,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                     Fetch Desdemona hither.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Say it, Othello.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have pass'd.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline;
    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively. I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.               I pray you, hear her speak.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                      My noble father,

0
ABANTIO.                  God be with you! I have done.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
  DUKE.

KE.                          If you please,

0
ABANTIO.              I'll not have it so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor I.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.      Nor I. I would not there reside
  DUKE. 
0
KE. What would you, Desdemona?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Let her have your voices.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be it as you shall privately determine,
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Tonight, my lord?

  FIRST

RST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
  BRABANTIO.

HELLO. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,

DERIGO. Iago!
  IAGO.

GO. What say'st thou, noble heart?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, go to bed and sleep.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. At my lodging.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I'll be with thee betimes.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What say you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.

NTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?
  FIRST

RST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;

SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.
  SECOND

SSIO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.

SDEMONA.            Alas, she has no speech.

  EMILIA.

  IAGO.

GO. She that was ever fair and never proud,

SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO.

    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

  CASSIO.

SSIO. 'Fore God, an excellent song.

GO. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in

GO. O sweet England!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man

0
GO. And so do I too, lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
  ALL.

L. Excellent well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
  MONTANO.

NTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
  IAGO.

GO. You see this fellow that is gone before;
  MONTANO.

NTANO.                  But is he often thus?

NTANO.                        It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
    And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
  MONTANO.

  IAGO. 
0
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"
  CASSIO.

    Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!
    Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir-
    Help, masters!- Here's a goodly watch indeed!
                                                        A bell rings.
    Who's that that rings the bell?- Diablo, ho!
    The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed forever.

HELLO.                         I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,
    But never more be officer of mine.

SDEMONA.                   What's the matter?
  OTHELLO.

  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, past all surgery.

  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I know not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a

  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

GO. How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
    Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.                      Exit.

    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle everything he does

0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  IAGO. 
0
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Say you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. How?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come, come,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 I pray, talk me of Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 A man that all his time
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Away!                                                Exit.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Is not this man jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
    They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                 He went hence but now,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I prithee, do so.                             Exit Iago.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Lady, amen.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I humbly thank your ladyship.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. I humbly thank your ladyship.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.

ANCA. Save you, friend Cassio!
  CASSIO.

SSIO.                          What make you from home?
  BIANCA.

ANCA. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
  CASSIO.

SSIO.              Pardon me, Bianca.
  BIANCA.

ANCA.                  O Cassio, whence came this?
  CASSIO.

SSIO.                          Go to, woman!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                    Why, whose is it?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Leave you! wherefore?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I do attend here on the general;
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                       Why, I pray you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Not that I love you not.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                          But that you do not love me.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.            Exeunt.

GO. Will you think so?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                 Think so, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                    What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              An unauthorized kiss.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What then?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She is protectress of her honor too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, what of that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                That's not so good now.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                           What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Hath he said anything?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      What hath he said?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What? what?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lie-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. With her?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.              With her, on her, what you will.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they

0
GO. Work on,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What's the matter?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Rub him about the temples.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                              No, forbear;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou mock me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       I mock you? No, by heaven.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A horned man's a monster and a beast.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There's many a beast then in a populous city,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Did he confess it?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       Good sir, be a man;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                    Stand you awhile apart,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                Dost thou hear, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                That's not amiss;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. The worser that you give me the addition
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO.                         Alas, poor caitiff!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look, how he laughs already!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I never knew a woman love man so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do you hear, Cassio?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Prithee, say true.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am a very villain else.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Have you scored me? Well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. After her, after her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you sup there?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I intend so.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Prithee, come; will you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
  IAGO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, you must forget that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, that's not your way.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She's the worse for all this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, too gentle.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, 'tis foul in her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. With mine officer!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. That's fouler.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
  IAGO.

GO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico

DOVICO. God save the worthy general!

HELLO.                               With all my heart, sir.
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am very glad to see you, signior;
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lives, sir.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord

HELLO. Are you sure of that?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you will-"
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. A most unhappy one. I would do much
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fire and brimstone!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Are you wise?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. What, is he angry?
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO.                     May be the letter moved him;

SDEMONA. By my troth, I am glad on't.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                                Indeed!
  DESDEMONA.

HELLO. I am glad to see you mad.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                         Why, sweet Othello?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Devil!                                        Strikes her.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have not deserved this.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      O devil, devil!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Going.] I will not stay to offend you.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Truly, an obedient lady.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Mistress!
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What would you with her, sir?
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO.                              Who, I, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                             He is much changed.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO.                    What, strike his wife!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO.                            Is it his use?
  IAGO.

GO.                        Alas, alas!
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. I am sorry that I am deceived in him.             Exeunt.
  LODOVICO. 
0
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You have seen nothing, then?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, did they never whisper?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                Never, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Never.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Never, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's strange.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                               Pray, chuck, come hither.

HELLO.                          Let me see your eyes;

SDEMONA.         What horrible fancy's this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why, what art thou?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Heaven doth truly know it.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Desdemona! Away! away! away!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Had it pleased heaven
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           By heaven, you do me wrong.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Are not you a strumpet?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                       No, as I am a Christian.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, not a whore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, as I shall be saved.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't possible?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. With who?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who is thy lord?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                     He that is yours, sweet lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Here's a change indeed!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                      What's the matter, lady?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                 Beshrew him for't!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                             Speak within door.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You are a fool; go to.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                   O good Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. If 'twere no other-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What in the contrary?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

HELLO.                               Will you walk, sir?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will, my lord.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;

SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA.

ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA.

SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
    No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO.

SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,

    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;

                                   Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.

SDEMONA. Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
  OTHELLO.

SDEMONA. But half an hour!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     Being done, there is no pause.

SDEMONA. But while I say one prayer!

HELLO. I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.
    Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
    Where art thou?                                 Unlocks the door.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, now?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But now, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. It is the very error of the moon;
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Roderigo kill'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.              No, Cassio is not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,

SDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
  EMILIA.

ILIA. O, who hath done this deed?
  DESDEMONA.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA.

HELLO. She was false as water.
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                        My husband?
  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Are there not stones in heaven
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.          Exit Iago.
  GRATIANO.

HELLO.                   I am not valiant neither,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.          What did thy song bode, lady?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. [Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What is the matter?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
    O! O! O!

DERIGO. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
  IAGO.

GO. Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.           I would not follow him then.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, sir, content you.
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,
  IAGO.

GO.                     Call up her father,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
  IAGO.

DERIGO. What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
  IAGO.

GO. Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!
  BRABANTIO.

ABANTIO. What is the reason of this terrible summons?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Signior, is all your family within?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Are your doors lock'd?
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.                   Why? Wherefore ask you this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd! For shame, put on your gown;
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. What, have you lost your wits?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Not I. What are you?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. My name is Roderigo.
  BRABANTIO.

ABANTIO.                     The worser welcome.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Sir, sir, sir-

ABANTIO.               But thou must needs be sure
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                      Patience, good sir.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. What tell'st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                   Most grave Brabantio,

0
GO. 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God,

GO. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the

ABANTIO. Thou are a villain.
  IAGO.

GO.                          You are- a senator.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
  RODERIGO.

ABANTIO. It is too true an evil: gone she is,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Truly, I think they are.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.             Yes, sir, I have indeed.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               Let him do his spite.

HELLO.               Not I; I must be found.
  IAGO.

GO. By Janus, I think no.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.               What is the matter, think you?
  CASSIO.

HELLO.             'Tis well I am found by you.
  CASSIO.

SSIO.            Ancient, what makes he here?

  IAGO. 
0
GO. You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
  BRABANTIO.

ABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   Hold your hands,

  FIRST 
0
RST OFFICER.        'Tis true, most worthy signior;

ABANTIO.                How? The Duke in council?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is no composition in these news
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR.            Indeed they are disproportion'd;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. And mine, a hundred and forty.
  SECOND 
0
COND SENATOR.                      And mine, two hundred.

ILOR. [Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!
  FIRST

RST OFFICER. A messenger from the galleys.
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                                Now, what's the business?
  SAILOR. 
0
ILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. How say you by this change?
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR.                    This cannot be,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
  FIRST 
0
RST OFFICER. Here is more news.
  MESSENGER. 
0
SSENGER. The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,

  FIRST

  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me:
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                     Why, what's the matter?
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. My daughter! O, my daughter!
  ALL.

ABANTIO.              Humbly I thank your Grace.
  ALL. 
0
L.                   We are very sorry for't.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. [To Othello.] What in your own part can you say to this?
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  To vouch this is no proof,
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I do beseech you,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                     Fetch Desdemona hither.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Say it, Othello.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have pass'd.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline;
    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively. I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.               I pray you, hear her speak.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      My noble father,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.                  God be with you! I have done.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                          If you please,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.              I'll not have it so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor I.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.      Nor I. I would not there reside
  DUKE. 
0
KE. What would you, Desdemona?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Let her have your voices.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be it as you shall privately determine,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Tonight, my lord?
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                        This night.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                                 With all my heart.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.

0
HELLO.              So please your Grace, my ancient;
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  Let it be so.
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What say'st thou, noble heart?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, go to bed and sleep.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. At my lodging.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I'll be with thee betimes.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What say you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
  IAGO.

  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
  SECOND

COND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
  MONTANO.

NTANO.                 If that the Turkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;

  THIRD

IRD GENTLEMAN. News, lads! Our wars are done.

NTANO. How? Is this true?
  THIRD

SSIO. His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
    Of very expert and approved allowance;
    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
    Stand in bold cure.

NTANO. But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

SSIO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts

    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.

GO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            Alas, she has no speech.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. In faith, too much;
  EMILIA.

  IAGO. 
0
GO. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
  IAGO.

GO. I am about it, but indeed my invention
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Worse and worse.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. How if fair and foolish?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She never yet was foolish that was fair,
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the
  IAGO.

GO. There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,

SDEMONA. O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She that was ever fair and never proud,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. To do what?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Iago is most honest.
    Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest
    Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,
    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
    Good night.
                           Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
  IAGO.

GO. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She's a most exquisite lady.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She is indeed perfection.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Where are they?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

GO. Some wine, ho!
  CASSIO.

SSIO. 'Fore God, an excellent song.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in

SSIO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

GO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he

SSIO. To the health of our general!
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
  IAGO.

GO. O sweet England!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And so do I too, lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
  ALL. 
0
L. Excellent well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You see this fellow that is gone before;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                  But is he often thus?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.

0
NTANO.                        It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
    And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
  MONTANO.

NTANO. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor

GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!

  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
  MONTANO.

NTANO. Come, come, you're drunk.

    Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!

    Help, masters!- Here's a goodly watch indeed!
                                                        A bell rings.
    Who's that that rings the bell?- Diablo, ho!
    The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed forever.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                         I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,
    But never more be officer of mine.

SDEMONA.                   What's the matter?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.

  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, past all surgery.

GO. Marry, heaven forbid!

  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I know not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
  IAGO.

  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

GO. How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
    Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.                      Exit.

0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         I do beseech you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       What dost thou mean?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fear not my government.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  IAGO. 
0
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Say you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. How?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come, come,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 I pray, talk me of Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 A man that all his time
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Away!                                                Exit.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Is not this man jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
    They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                 He went hence but now,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I prithee, do so.                             Exit Iago.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Lady, amen.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout.
  CASSIO.

ANCA.                       Why, I pray you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Not that I love you not.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                          But that you do not love me.
  CASSIO.

GO.                                    What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              An unauthorized kiss.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What then?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She is protectress of her honor too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, what of that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                That's not so good now.

GO.                                           What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Hath he said anything?
  IAGO.

GO. He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      What hath he said?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What? what?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lie-
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. With her?
  IAGO.

GO.              With her, on her, what you will.
  OTHELLO.

GO. Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!
  CASSIO.

GO.                                    Stand you awhile apart,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                Dost thou hear, Iago?

GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. The worser that you give me the addition
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
  CASSIO.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Look, how he laughs already!
  IAGO.

GO. I never knew a woman love man so.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
  IAGO.

GO. Do you hear, Cassio?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                   Now he importunes him
  IAGO.

GO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Prithee, say true.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am a very villain else.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Have you scored me? Well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. After her, after her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you sup there?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I intend so.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Prithee, come; will you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, you must forget that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, that's not your way.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She's the worse for all this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, too gentle.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, 'tis foul in her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. With mine officer!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. That's fouler.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more
  OTHELLO.

SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. [Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you will-"
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper.

SDEMONA. A most unhappy one. I would do much

HELLO. Fire and brimstone!
  DESDEMONA.

GO. He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO.                    What, strike his wife!

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. You have seen nothing, then?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard

HELLO. What, did they never whisper?
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Never.

HELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

HELLO. That's strange.
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?

HELLO. Why, what art thou?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Heaven doth truly know it.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
  OTHELLO.

SDEMONA.           By heaven, you do me wrong.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Are not you a strumpet?

SDEMONA.                       No, as I am a Christian.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What, not a whore?

SDEMONA.                  No, as I shall be saved.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Is't possible?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;

GO.                      What's the matter, lady?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,

SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO.

GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO.

  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very

GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups

SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the

  IAGO.

GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
    No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO.

SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!

SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!

SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, villain that I am!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                        It is even so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
     Exit.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!

DERIGO. O wretched villain!
  LODOVICO.

  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. We do not know.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,

GO.                   O treacherous villains!

DERIGO. O, help me here!

SSIO. That's one of them.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.
  IAGO.

GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
    Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA.

GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect

SSIO. No.

GO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. What, of Venice?
  IAGO.

ATIANO.                             Know him! ay.

ATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Roderigo!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  IAGO.

GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
                                   Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
    Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

HELLO.                         Ay, Desdemona.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Will you come to bed, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Ay, my lord.
  OTHELLO.

0
HELLO. Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.

SDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.

SDEMONA. I will so. What's the matter?

    Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw.

ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.

ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,

    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
    As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!

  EMILIA.

ILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
    O! O! O!

  FIRST

ABANTIO.                How? The Duke in council?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is no composition in these news
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR.            Indeed they are disproportion'd;
  DUKE.

  SAILOR.

0
ABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  To vouch this is no proof,
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I do beseech you,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                     Fetch Desdemona hither.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Say it, Othello.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have pass'd.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline;
    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively. I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.               I pray you, hear her speak.

  DUKE. 
0
KE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
  OTHELLO.

  DUKE.

KE.                          If you please,

0
ABANTIO.              I'll not have it so.

0
SDEMONA.      Nor I. I would not there reside

SDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him,

0
DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. At my lodging.
  RODERIGO.

  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What say you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.

SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid

    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,

SSIO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.

GO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. She is indeed perfection.
  IAGO.

GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man

GO. And so do I too, lieutenant.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to

NTANO.                        It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
    And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
  MONTANO.

NTANO. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor

GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"

    You will be shamed forever.

SSIO. I know not.
  IAGO.

GO. Is't possible?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a

  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
    Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.                      Exit.

    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle everything he does
    With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,
    For thy solicitor shall rather die
    Than give thy cause away.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Madam, here comes my lord.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, I'll take my leave.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Nay, stay and hear me speak.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Well, do your discretion.                   Exit Cassio.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ha! I like not that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou say?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             I do believe 'twas he.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, my lord!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Who is't you mean?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Went he hence now?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Ay, sooth; so humbled
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. But shall't be shortly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                           The sooner, sweet, for you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall't be tonight at supper?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                                 No, not tonight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Tomorrow dinner then?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I shall not dine at home;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  Why, this is not a boon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I will deny thee nothing,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Indeed!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Honest, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Honest? Ay, honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, for aught I know.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou think?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Think, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, you know I love you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                            I think thou dost;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       For Michael Cassio,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         I do beseech you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       What dost thou mean?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fear not my government.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  IAGO. 
0
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Say you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. How?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come, come,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 I pray, talk me of Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 A man that all his time
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Away!                                                Exit.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Is not this man jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
    They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                 He went hence but now,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I prithee, do so.                             Exit Iago.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Lady, amen.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout.
  CASSIO.

  CASSIO.

SSIO.                          Go to, woman!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                    Why, whose is it?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Leave you! wherefore?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I do attend here on the general;
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                       Why, I pray you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Not that I love you not.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA.                          But that you do not love me.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.            Exeunt.

GO. Will you think so?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                 Think so, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                    What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              An unauthorized kiss.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What then?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She is protectress of her honor too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, what of that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                That's not so good now.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                           What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Hath he said anything?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      What hath he said?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What? what?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lie-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. With her?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.              With her, on her, what you will.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Work on,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What's the matter?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Rub him about the temples.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                              No, forbear;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou mock me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       I mock you? No, by heaven.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A horned man's a monster and a beast.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There's many a beast then in a populous city,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Did he confess it?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       Good sir, be a man;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                    Stand you awhile apart,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                Dost thou hear, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                That's not amiss;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. The worser that you give me the addition
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO.                         Alas, poor caitiff!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look, how he laughs already!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I never knew a woman love man so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do you hear, Cassio?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Prithee, say true.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am a very villain else.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Have you scored me? Well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. After her, after her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you sup there?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I intend so.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Prithee, come; will you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, you must forget that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, that's not your way.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She's the worse for all this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, too gentle.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, 'tis foul in her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. With mine officer!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. That's fouler.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
  IAGO.

GO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico

HELLO.                               With all my heart, sir.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
  IAGO.

GO. I am very glad to see you, signior;

DOVICO. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
  IAGO.

GO. Lives, sir.

SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. [Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you will-"
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. A most unhappy one. I would do much

HELLO. Fire and brimstone!
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Are you wise?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. What, is he angry?

DOVICO.                     May be the letter moved him;

SDEMONA. By my troth, I am glad on't.

HELLO.                      O devil, devil!
  DESDEMONA.

DOVICO.                              Who, I, my lord?

HELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.

GO.                             He is much changed.
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO.                    What, strike his wife!
  IAGO.

GO. Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You have seen nothing, then?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, did they never whisper?
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                                Never, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Never.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Never, my lord.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. That's strange.
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?

HELLO. [To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,

SDEMONA. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why, what art thou?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Heaven doth truly know it.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Desdemona! Away! away! away!
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                    Had it pleased heaven
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,

0
SDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           By heaven, you do me wrong.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Are not you a strumpet?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                       No, as I am a Christian.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What, not a whore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, as I shall be saved.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Is't possible?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;

SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  IAGO.

GO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes

GO.                      What's the matter, lady?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,

SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO.

GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO.

GO.                                 Beshrew him for't!
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA.

ILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!

GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.

GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and

GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

DOVICO. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Your honor is most welcome.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                               Will you walk, sir?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will, my lord.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
    No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
    Falls.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, villain that I am!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                        It is even so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
     Exit.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. O, help!
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O wretched villain!
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. We do not know.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                   O treacherous villains!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, help me here!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That's one of them.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
    Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What, of Venice?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.                             Know him! ay.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Roderigo!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
                                   Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
    Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                      As I! foh! fie upon thee!
  IAGO.

  IAGO.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Who's there? Othello?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         Ay, Desdemona.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Will you come to bed, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Ay, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If you bethink yourself of any crime
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Talk you of killing?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, I do.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then heaven have mercy on me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Amen, with all my heart!
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Hum!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Think on thy sins.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                  They are loves I bear to you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   Peace, and be still!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will so. What's the matter?

HELLO.                   He hath confess'd.
  DESDEMONA.

HELLO. Ay.

HELLO.                     Being done, there is no pause.

SDEMONA. But while I say one prayer!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                        It is too late.     He stifles her.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. [Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. [Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                                      Who's there?

HELLO. What, now?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. But now, my lord.
  OTHELLO.

ILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Roderigo kill'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.              No, Cassio is not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,

SDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                                   Alas, what cry is that?

ILIA. O, who hath done this deed?
  DESDEMONA.

ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She was false as water.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Thou art rash as fire, to say
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. My husband?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thy husband.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. That she was false to wedlock?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
  EMILIA.

HELLO.                             He, woman;

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
    As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!

0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
    O! O! O!

0
ABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  To vouch this is no proof,
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                     I do beseech you,
  DUKE.

KE.                     Fetch Desdemona hither.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Say it, Othello.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have pass'd.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline;
    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively. I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.               I pray you, hear her speak.

  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
  DUKE.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              So please your Grace, my ancient;
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  Let it be so.
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What say'st thou, noble heart?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, go to bed and sleep.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. At my lodging.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I'll be with thee betimes.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What say you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
  IAGO. 
0
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                 If that the Turkish fleet
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                 If that the Turkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
    It is impossible to bear it out.
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN. News, lads! Our wars are done.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. How? Is this true?
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN.            The ship is here put in,
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                         Pray heavens he be,
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN. Come, let's do so,
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN. Come, let's do so,
    For every minute is expectancy
    Of more arrivance.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. I she well shipp'd?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
    Of very expert and approved allowance;
    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
    Stand in bold cure.
                              A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
  FOURTH 
0
URTH GENTLEMAN. The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. My hopes do shape him for the governor.
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO.                 I pray you, sir, go forth,
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. I shall.                                    Exit.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He has had most favorable and happy speed:
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                What is she?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            I thank you, valiant Cassio.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, but I fear- How lost you company?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. The great contention of the sea and skies
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. They give their greeting to the citadel;
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO.                      See for the news.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            Alas, she has no speech.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. In faith, too much;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You have little cause to say so.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You shall not write my praise.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  No, let me not.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O gentle lady, do not put me to't,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am not merry, but I do beguile
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am about it, but indeed my invention
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Worse and worse.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. How if fair and foolish?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She never yet was foolish that was fair,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She that was ever fair and never proud,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. To do what?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis truly so.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Let's meet him and receive him.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Lo, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O my fair warrior!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  My dear Othello!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. It gives me wonder great as my content
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                  The heavens forbid
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Amen to that, sweet powers!
  IAGO.

GO.                     [Aside.] O, you are well tuned now!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Come, let us to the castle.
  IAGO.

GO. Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou

0
DERIGO. With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the

0
DERIGO. Well.
  IAGO.

GO. Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may

DERIGO. Adieu.                                              Exit.
  IAGO.

GO. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;

RALD. It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,
  HERALD. 
0
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Iago hath direction what to do;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Iago is most honest.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Iago is most honest.
    Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest
    Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,
    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
    Good night.
                           Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She's a most exquisite lady.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She is indeed perfection.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Where are they?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Some wine, ho!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Fore God, an excellent song.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he

SSIO. To the health of our general!
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O sweet England!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And so do I too, lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
  ALL. 
0
L. Excellent well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You see this fellow that is gone before;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                  But is he often thus?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                        It were well
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                        It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
    And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
  IAGO. 
0
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. What's the matter, lieutenant?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Beat me!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Dost thou prate, rogue?                   Strikes Roderigo.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Come, come, you're drunk.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Drunk?                                          They fight.

                                                       Exit Roderigo.
    Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!
    Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir-
    Help, masters!- Here's a goodly watch indeed!
                                                        A bell rings.
    Who's that that rings the bell?- Diablo, ho!
    The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed forever.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      What is the matter here?
  MONTANO.

NTANO. 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

HELLO. Hold, for your lives!

GO. Hold, ho! Lieutenant- sir- Montano- gentlemen-

GO. I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,

HELLO. How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
  MONTANO.

NTANO. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Now, by heaven,

NTANO. If partially affined, or leagued in office,

HELLO.                         I know, Iago,

0
HELLO.                         I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,
    But never more be officer of mine.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                   What's the matter?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, past all surgery.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Marry, heaven forbid!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my
  IAGO. 
0
GO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What was he that you followed with your sword?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I know not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a

GO. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be

0
SSIO. You advise me well.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Good night, honest Iago.                              Exit.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

DERIGO. I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that

GO. How poor are they that have not patience!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
    Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.                      Exit.

  FIRST

  FIRST

  CLOWN.

OWN. Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But,
  FIRST

RST MUSICIAN. Well, sir, we will not.
  CLOWN.

  CLOWN.

  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
  CASSIO.

  CASSIO.

SSIO. Why, no; the day had broke
  IAGO.

SDEMONA. Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here
    I give thee warrant of thy place, assure thee,
    If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
    To the last article. My lord shall never rest;
    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle everything he does
    With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,
    For thy solicitor shall rather die
    Than give thy cause away.

  IAGO.

GO. Ha! I like not that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou say?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             I do believe 'twas he.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, my lord!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Who is't you mean?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Went he hence now?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Ay, sooth; so humbled
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. But shall't be shortly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                           The sooner, sweet, for you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall't be tonight at supper?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                                 No, not tonight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Tomorrow dinner then?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I shall not dine at home;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  Why, this is not a boon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I will deny thee nothing,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Indeed!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Honest, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Honest? Ay, honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, for aught I know.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou think?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Think, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, you know I love you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                            I think thou dost;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       For Michael Cassio,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         I do beseech you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       What dost thou mean?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fear not my government.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  IAGO. 
0
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief

    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full

GO.                                    What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              An unauthorized kiss.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What then?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She is protectress of her honor too.

GO. Her honor is an essence that's not seen;

HELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, what of that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                That's not so good now.

GO.                                           What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Hath he said anything?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                      What hath he said?

GO. Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What's the matter?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
  CASSIO.

  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       I mock you? No, by heaven.
  OTHELLO.

GO. There's many a beast then in a populous city,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Did he confess it?
  IAGO.

GO.                       Good sir, be a man;

GO.                                That's not amiss;
  IAGO.

GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. The worser that you give me the addition
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
  CASSIO.

SSIO.                         Alas, poor caitiff!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look, how he laughs already!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I never knew a woman love man so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do you hear, Cassio?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Prithee, say true.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am a very villain else.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Have you scored me? Well.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. After her, after her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you sup there?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I intend so.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Prithee, come; will you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair

GO. Nay, you must forget that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, that's not your way.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She's the worse for all this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a

0
GO. Ay, too gentle.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
  IAGO.

GO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, 'tis foul in her.
  OTHELLO.

0
GO. That's fouler.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate

GO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed

HELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.

GO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more

HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

  OTHELLO.

    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,

    And keep the gate of hell!

ILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. With who?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who is thy lord?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                     He that is yours, sweet lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Here's a change indeed!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                      What's the matter, lady?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                 Beshrew him for't!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                             Speak within door.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You are a fool; go to.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                   O good Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. If 'twere no other-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What in the contrary?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

DOVICO. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.

0
DOVICO. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Your honor is most welcome.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                               Will you walk, sir?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will, my lord.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
    No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
  CASSIO.

SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, villain that I am!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                        It is even so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
     Exit.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!
  GRATIANO.

SSIO. O, help!
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O wretched villain!
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. We do not know.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                   O treacherous villains!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, help me here!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That's one of them.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
    Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
  IAGO.

GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
  CASSIO.

SSIO. No.

ATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
  IAGO.

GO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  BIANCA.

ANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
  IAGO.

GO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What, of Venice?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.                             Know him! ay.
  IAGO.

GO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  IAGO.

GO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Roderigo!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
  CASSIO.

SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO.

GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  IAGO.

GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
                                   Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
    Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
  EMILIA.

HELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?

SDEMONA. Ay, my lord.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What, now?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But now, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. It is the very error of the moon;
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Roderigo kill'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.              No, Cassio is not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                   Alas, what cry is that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That? what?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. A guiltless death I die.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, who hath done this deed?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Nobody; I myself. Farewell;
  OTHELLO.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She was false as water.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Thou art rash as fire, to say
  OTHELLO.

ILIA. My husband?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thy husband.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. That she was false to wedlock?

ILIA.                          My husband?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                        My husband?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                             He, woman;
  EMILIA.

HELLO.                     Peace, you were best.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
    As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
  ALL.

  EMILIA. 
0

HELLO.            [Rises.] O, she was foul!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows
  EMILIA.

ILIA. O heaven! O heavenly powers!
  IAGO.

ATIANO.                                    Fie!

ILIA. O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak'st of
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Villainous whore!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Filth, thou liest!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Are there not stones in heaven
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.          Exit Iago.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am not valiant neither,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.          What did thy song bode, lady?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. [Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What is the matter?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
    O! O! O!
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

HELLO. That's he that was Othello. Here I am.

DOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Wrench his sword from him.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,

0
DOVICO. O thou Othello, that wert once so good,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Why, anything;

0
DOVICO. This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.

  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. What, not to pray?
  GRATIANO.

  CASSIO.

SSIO. There is besides in Roderigo's letter,

DOVICO. You must forsake this room, and go with us.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. O bloody period!
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO.                  All that's spoke is marr'd.
  OTHELLO.

RST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.

HELLO.                     I do beseech you,

HELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.

KE. Say it, Othello.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    Still question'd me the story of my life
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have pass'd.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline;
    But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively. I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
  DUKE.

KE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.

DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO.

  RODERIGO.

GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times

0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO.

GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the

    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,

    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,

    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
    And bring all Cyprus comfort.

    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.

    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
    And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?

HELLO.                         I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,
    But never more be officer of mine.

HELLO. All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.

SSIO. I know not.
  IAGO.

GO. Is't possible?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
  IAGO.

GO. Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place,
  CASSIO.

  IAGO.

GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

GO. How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
    Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.                      Exit.

GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO.

GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO.

GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO.

GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO.

SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN.

OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA.

ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born

SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;

SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO.

SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief

SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Say you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. How?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.

SDEMONA. Come, come,
  OTHELLO.

ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
    They eat us hungerly, and when they are full

GO. Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                 He went hence but now,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,

SDEMONA. I prithee, do so.                             Exit Iago.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
  EMILIA.

ILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;

SDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

GO.                                    What,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              An unauthorized kiss.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What then?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She is protectress of her honor too.
  IAGO.

GO. Her honor is an essence that's not seen;

HELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
  IAGO.

GO. Ay, what of that?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                That's not so good now.

GO. Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!
  CASSIO.

SSIO. What's the matter?
  IAGO.

GO.                                That's not amiss;
  IAGO.

                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. The worser that you give me the addition

GO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.

  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Look, how he laughs already!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I never knew a woman love man so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do you hear, Cassio?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
  IAGO.

GO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
  CASSIO.

  CASSIO.

HELLO. Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
  CASSIO.

SSIO. So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls

0
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.

GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. After her, after her.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you sup there?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Faith, I intend so.

GO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak

GO. Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Iago!
  IAGO.

GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO.

GO. Nay, that's not your way.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
  IAGO.

GO. She's the worse for all this.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a

0
GO. Ay, too gentle.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!

HELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You have seen nothing, then?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, did they never whisper?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                Never, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor send you out o' the way?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Never.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Never, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's strange.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Bid her come hither; go.         Exit Emilia.
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                               Pray, chuck, come hither.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. What is your pleasure?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                          Let me see your eyes;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.         What horrible fancy's this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. [To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why, what art thou?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Heaven doth truly know it.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O Desdemona! Away! away! away!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Had it pleased heaven
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           By heaven, you do me wrong.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Are not you a strumpet?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                       No, as I am a Christian.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, not a whore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, as I shall be saved.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't possible?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. With who?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who is thy lord?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                     He that is yours, sweet lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Here's a change indeed!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                      What's the matter, lady?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                 Beshrew him for't!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                             Speak within door.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You are a fool; go to.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                   O good Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. If 'twere no other-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What in the contrary?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

HELLO. O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.

DOVICO. Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Your honor is most welcome.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                               Will you walk, sir?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will, my lord.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
    No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!

SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!

DERIGO. O, villain that I am!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                        It is even so.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!

HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
     Exit.

  IAGO.

GO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. We do not know.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO.

GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO.

GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO.

DERIGO. O, help me here!

GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO.

GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO.

GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. No.

                                   Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
    Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?

GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,

  OTHELLO.

    Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
    Where art thou?                                 Unlocks the door.
  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, now?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But now, my lord.
  OTHELLO.

ILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Roderigo kill'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.              No, Cassio is not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,

ILIA. O, who hath done this deed?
  DESDEMONA.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She was false as water.
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                        My husband?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                             He, woman;

ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
    As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!

  EMILIA.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
  ALL.

  EMILIA. 
0

  OTHELLO.

ATIANO. 'Tis a strange truth.
  MONTANO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            [Rises.] O, she was foul!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows
  EMILIA.

ILIA. O heaven! O heavenly powers!
  IAGO.

ATIANO.                                    Fie!

ILIA. O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak'st of
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Villainous whore!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Filth, thou liest!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Are there not stones in heaven
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.          Exit Iago.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am not valiant neither,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.          What did thy song bode, lady?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. [Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What is the matter?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day
    That with this little arm and this good sword
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
    O! O! O!
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. That's he that was Othello. Here I am.
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Wrench his sword from him.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,

DOVICO. O thou Othello, that wert once so good,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      Why, anything;

0
DOVICO. This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.

HELLO. Ay.

  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. What, not to pray?
  GRATIANO.

  CASSIO.

SSIO. There is besides in Roderigo's letter,

0
DOVICO. You must forsake this room, and go with us.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. O bloody period!
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO.                  All that's spoke is marr'd.
  OTHELLO.

  IAGO.

HELLO.                   Hold your hands,

  FIRST

RST OFFICER.        'Tis true, most worthy signior;

ABANTIO.                How? The Duke in council?
  DUKE. 
0
KE. There is no composition in these news
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR.            Indeed they are disproportion'd;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. And mine, a hundred and forty.
  SECOND 
0
COND SENATOR.                      And mine, two hundred.

ILOR. [Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!
  FIRST

RST OFFICER. A messenger from the galleys.
  DUKE.

KE.                                Now, what's the business?
  SAILOR. 
0
ILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,
  DUKE.

KE. How say you by this change?
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR.                    This cannot be,
  DUKE.

RST OFFICER. Here is more news.
  MESSENGER.

SSENGER. The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,

  ALL.

  DUKE.

  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.            A maiden never bold,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                  To vouch this is no proof,
  FIRST 
0
RST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I do beseech you,
  DUKE. 
0
KE.                     Fetch Desdemona hither.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Say it, Othello.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
  DUKE. 
0
KE. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.               I pray you, hear her speak.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      My noble father,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.                  God be with you! I have done.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
  DUKE. 
0
KE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
  DUKE.

KE.                          If you please,
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO.              I'll not have it so.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nor I.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.      Nor I. I would not there reside
  DUKE. 
0
KE. What would you, Desdemona?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Let her have your voices.
  DUKE. 
0
KE. Be it as you shall privately determine,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Tonight, my lord?
  DUKE.

RST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
  BRABANTIO. 
0
ABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Iago!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What say'st thou, noble heart?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, go to bed and sleep.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. At my lodging.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I'll be with thee betimes.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What say you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?
  FIRST 
0
RST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
  MONTANO.

NTANO.                 If that the Turkish fleet

IRD GENTLEMAN. News, lads! Our wars are done.

NTANO. How? Is this true?
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN.            The ship is here put in,
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
  MONTANO.

NTANO.                         Pray heavens he be,
  THIRD 
0
IRD GENTLEMAN. Come, let's do so,

SSIO. Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,

URTH GENTLEMAN. The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea

SSIO. My hopes do shape him for the governor.
  SECOND

COND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO.                 I pray you, sir, go forth,
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. I shall.                                    Exit.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He has had most favorable and happy speed:
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                What is she?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            I thank you, valiant Cassio.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, but I fear- How lost you company?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. The great contention of the sea and skies
  SECOND 
0
COND GENTLEMAN. They give their greeting to the citadel;
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO.                      See for the news.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            Alas, she has no speech.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. In faith, too much;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You have little cause to say so.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You shall not write my praise.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  No, let me not.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O gentle lady, do not put me to't,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am not merry, but I do beguile
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am about it, but indeed my invention
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Worse and worse.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. How if fair and foolish?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She never yet was foolish that was fair,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She that was ever fair and never proud,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. To do what?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. 'Tis truly so.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Let's meet him and receive him.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Lo, where he comes!
  OTHELLO.

DERIGO. With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me

DERIGO. I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest
  IAGO.

GO. Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If

DERIGO. Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

GO. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;

0
RALD. It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Iago hath direction what to do;
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.            Iago is most honest.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
  IAGO.

GO. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our

0
SSIO. She's a most exquisite lady.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She is indeed perfection.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Where are they?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.
  IAGO.

GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
  CASSIO.

GO. O sweet England!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And so do I too, lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to

  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You see this fellow that is gone before;
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO.                  But is he often thus?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
  MONTANO.

NTANO.                        It were well

SSIO. Dost thou prate, rogue?                   Strikes Roderigo.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. Come, come, you're drunk.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Drunk?                                          They fight.

GO. [Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say; go out and cry a mutiny.

HELLO.                      What is the matter here?

HELLO. How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
  CASSIO.

SSIO. I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

HELLO.                    Now, by heaven,

  CASSIO.

SSIO. Ay, past all surgery.
  IAGO.

SSIO. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my

GO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily

GO. What was he that you followed with your sword?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I know not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the

HELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

HELLO.                           The sooner, sweet, for you.

HELLO.                         I shall not dine at home;

HELLO. Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;

0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Indeed!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Honest, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Honest? Ay, honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, for aught I know.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou think?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Think, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, you know I love you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                            I think thou dost;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       For Michael Cassio,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         I do beseech you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       What dost thou mean?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fear not my government.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Say you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. How?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come, come,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 I pray, talk me of Cassio.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 A man that all his time
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Away!                                                Exit.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Is not this man jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                 He went hence but now,
  IAGO. 
0

  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO.

0
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO.

SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.

ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.

SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!

SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.

0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,

GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!

DOVICO. Hark!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O wretched villain!
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  IAGO. 
0

GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?

SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO.

GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                   O treacherous villains!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, help me here!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That's one of them.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. No.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What, of Venice?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.                             Know him! ay.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Roderigo!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
  BIANCA. 
0
ANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
  BIANCA.

ANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest

SDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
  OTHELLO.

ILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?

0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO.

SDEMONA.            Alas, she has no speech.

GO. To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the

GO. [Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. 'Tis truly so.

  IAGO.

HELLO. Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Iago hath direction what to do;
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.            Iago is most honest.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
  IAGO.

GO. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our

0
SSIO. She's a most exquisite lady.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. She is indeed perfection.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains
  IAGO. 
0
GO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily
  IAGO.

GO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Where are they?
  IAGO.

GO. Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.
  IAGO.

GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
  CASSIO.

CASSIO
SSIO. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
  MONTANO.

CASSIO
NTANO. Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a

CASSIO
GO. Some wine, ho!
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. 'Fore God, an excellent song.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he

CASSIO
SSIO. To the health of our general!
  MONTANO. 
1
CASSIO
NTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. O sweet England!
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. And so do I too, lieutenant.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
  ALL. 
1
CASSIO
L. Excellent well.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
  MONTANO.

CASSIO
NTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. You see this fellow that is gone before;
  MONTANO. 
1
CASSIO
NTANO.                  But is he often thus?
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
  MONTANO. 
1
CASSIO
NTANO.                        It were well
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
  IAGO.

CASSIO
GO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
    I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.              Exit Roderigo.

CASSIO
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!
  MONTANO. 
1
CASSIO
NTANO. What's the matter, lieutenant?
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a
  RODERIGO. 
1
CASSIO
DERIGO. Beat me!
  CASSIO.

CASSIO
SSIO. Dost thou prate, rogue?                   Strikes Roderigo.
  MONTANO. 
1
CASSIO
NTANO. Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
  MONTANO. 
1
CASSIO
NTANO. Come, come, you're drunk.
  CASSIO.

CASSIO

    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
    Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.

HELLO.                                 No, not tonight.

SDEMONA. Tomorrow dinner then?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I shall not dine at home;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  Why, this is not a boon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I will deny thee nothing,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Indeed!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Honest, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Honest? Ay, honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, for aught I know.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou think?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Think, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, you know I love you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                            I think thou dost;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       For Michael Cassio,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         I do beseech you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       What dost thou mean?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fear not my government.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
                                        Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
  EMILIA. 
1
DESDEMONA
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!

3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  OTHELLO.

  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Say you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. How?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I say, it is not lost.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch't, let me see it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Come, come,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                 I pray, talk me of Cassio.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. The handkerchief!
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA.                 A man that all his time

HELLO. The handkerchief!

SDEMONA. In sooth, you are to blame.
  OTHELLO.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Is not this man jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Is my lord angry?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                 He went hence but now,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I prithee, do so.                             Exit Iago.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;

SDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Lady, amen.
  DESDEMONA.

CASSIO
GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

CASSIO
GO. Do you hear, Cassio?
  OTHELLO.

CASSIO
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him

CASSIO
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see

1
CASSIO
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
1
CASSIO
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

HELLO. O Iago!
  IAGO.

GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
  OTHELLO.

GO. Nay, you must forget that.
  OTHELLO.

GO. Ay, too gentle.
  OTHELLO.

GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA.

EMILIA
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

SDEMONA. I will, my lord.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. O, villain that I am!

HELLO.                        It is even so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!

SSIO. O, help!
  LODOVICO.

DOVICO. Hark!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O wretched villain!
  LODOVICO.

DERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
  LODOVICO.

IAGO
DOVICO. Hark!
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. We do not know.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                   O treacherous villains!
  RODERIGO. 
1
IAGO
DERIGO. O, help me here!
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. That's one of them.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
1
IAGO
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,

1
IAGO
GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. No.

IAGO
ATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,

1
IAGO
ANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. What, of Venice?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO.                             Know him! ay.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Roderigo!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  EMILIA. 
1
IAGO
ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA. 
1
IAGO
ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,

IAGO
ANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

1
IAGO
GO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
  EMILIA. 
1
IAGO
ILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

SDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.

ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She was false as water.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Thou art rash as fire, to say
  OTHELLO.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
  ALL.

  EMILIA.

  OTHELLO.

ATIANO. 'Tis a strange truth.
  MONTANO.

CASSIO
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

CASSIO
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does

CASSIO
GO. It's true, good lieutenant.

CASSIO
NTANO.                  But is he often thus?
  IAGO.

CASSIO
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"

  CASSIO.

    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.

SDEMONA. Nay, stay and hear me speak.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Well, do your discretion.                   Exit Cassio.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ha! I like not that.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou say?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             I do believe 'twas he.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. How now, my lord!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Who is't you mean?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                    Went he hence now?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Ay, sooth; so humbled
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. But shall't be shortly?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                           The sooner, sweet, for you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall't be tonight at supper?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                                 No, not tonight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Tomorrow dinner then?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                         I shall not dine at home;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  Why, this is not a boon;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     I will deny thee nothing,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.             What dost thou say, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Indeed!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Honest, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Honest? Ay, honest.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, for aught I know.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What dost thou think?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Think, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. My lord, you know I love you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                            I think thou dost;
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                       For Michael Cassio,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                         I do beseech you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       What dost thou mean?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Fear not my government.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
                                        Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
  EMILIA. 
1
DESDEMONA
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                          Yet be content.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O, blood, blood, blood!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                     Do not rise yet.                  Kneels.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                     I greet thy love,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can anything be made of this?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
  CLOWN. 
0
OWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Is he not jealous?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Look, where he comes.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will not leave him now till Cassio
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.               Well, my good lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. You may, indeed, say so;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What promise, chuck?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Here, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That which I gave you.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have it not about me.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That's a fault. That handkerchief
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen't!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha! wherefore?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
  OTHELLO. 
0

CASSIO
GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

CASSIO
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him

CASSIO
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
1
CASSIO
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. Was that mine?

  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                                 Beshrew him for't!
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                             Speak within door.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You are a fool; go to.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA.                   O good Iago,
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. If 'twere no other-
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. What in the contrary?
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

HELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I will, my lord.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O, villain that I am!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO.                        It is even so.
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!
  GRATIANO.

ATIANO. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
  CASSIO.

SSIO. O, help!
  LODOVICO. 
0
DOVICO. Hark!
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. O wretched villain!
  LODOVICO.

DERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
  LODOVICO.

IAGO
DOVICO. Hark!
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. We do not know.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                     Did not you hear a cry?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                                       What's the matter?
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                   O treacherous villains!
  RODERIGO. 
1
IAGO
DERIGO. O, help me here!
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. That's one of them.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                       O murtherous slave! O villain!
  RODERIGO. 
1
IAGO
DERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Who is't that cried?
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. No.
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. What, of Venice?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Even he, sir. Did you know him?
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO.                             Know him! ay.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Roderigo!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  EMILIA. 
1
IAGO
ILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
  EMILIA. 
1
IAGO
ILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
  EMILIA. 
1
IAGO
ILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
  BIANCA. 
1
IAGO
ANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest

IAGO
ILIA.                      As I! foh! fie upon thee!

SDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
  OTHELLO.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Roderigo kill'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.              No, Cassio is not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,

SDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
  EMILIA.

  DESDEMONA.

ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She was false as water.

DERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.
  IAGO.

GO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
  IAGO.

GO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. It cannot be.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
  IAGO.

GO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
  IAGO.

GO. At my lodging.
  RODERIGO.

  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. What say you?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. No more of drowning, do you hear?
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO. I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.

SSIO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame,
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.

GO. And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
  CASSIO.

  IAGO. 
0
GO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
  CASSIO. 
0
SSIO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
  IAGO.

GO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

CASSIO
GO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
    As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honors in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle. But here they come.
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

SSIO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

CASSIO
GO. Will you hear't again?
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does

CASSIO
NTANO.                  But is he often thus?
  IAGO. 
1
CASSIO
GO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.

CASSIO
GO.             Not I, for this fair island.
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
                                          A cry within, "Help, help!"

  CASSIO.

    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
    And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.

GO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. But for a satisfaction of my thought;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Why of thy thought, Iago?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O, yes, and went between us very oft.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Indeed!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
  IAGO.

GO. Honest, my lord?

GO. My lord, for aught I know.

HELLO. What dost thou think?

  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I think so too.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                    Men should be what they seem;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, yet there's more in this.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                 Good my lord, pardon me;

HELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,

  IAGO. 
0
GO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O misery!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.         Why, why is this?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Dost thou say so?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. She did deceive her father, marrying you;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.               And so she did.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                                  Why, go to then.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am bound to thee forever.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          I'faith, I fear it has.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I will not.
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                Should you do so, my lord,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                       No, not much moved.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. And yet, how nature erring from itself-
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.              Farewell, farewell.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
  IAGO. 
0
GO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
  OTHELLO.

GO. I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
    To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
    She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA.            How now, my dear Othello!
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. I am to blame.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA.              Why do you speak so faintly?
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead here.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
  OTHELLO. 
1
DESDEMONA
HELLO.           Your napkin is too little;
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
DESDEMONA
SDEMONA. I am very sorry that you are not well.
                                        Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
  EMILIA. 
1
DESDEMONA
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago. What he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. How now, what do you here alone?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. A thing for me? It is a common thing-
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. Ha!
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. To have a foolish wife.
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO.                         What handkerchief?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. What handkerchief?
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Hast stol'n it from her?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO.               A good wench; give it me.
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
  EMILIA. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
ILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import,
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
  IAGO. 
2
IAGO
DESDEMONA
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
  IAGO.

DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.                                        Exit Emilia.
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood
    Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
    Look, where he comes!
  OTHELLO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                       Ha, ha, false to me?

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Why, how now, general! No more of that.
  OTHELLO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO

  IAGO.

IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                          How now, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I am sorry to hear this.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Is't possible, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO

  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                         Is't come to this?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. My noble lord-
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. If thou dost slander her and torture me,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                O grace! O heaven defend me!
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                       By the world,
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                  Would? Nay, I will.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I do not like the office;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O monstrous! monstrous!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO.                            Nay, this was but his dream.
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. And this may help to thicken other proofs
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                      I'll tear her all to pieces.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO.                          If it be that-
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
GO. If it be that, or any that was hers,
  OTHELLO. 
3
IAGO
DESDEMONA
OTHELLO
HELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
  IAGO. 
3
IAGO

IAGO
DESDEMONA

SDEMONA. Why, man?
  CLOWN.

OWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he?
  CLOWN.

  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know not, madam.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse

SDEMONA.                     Is't possible?
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                      Indeed! is't true?
  OTHELLO.

SDEMONA. Heaven bless us!

CASSIO
GO.                                That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
                                                     Othello retires.
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

CASSIO
HELLO.                   Now he importunes him

CASSIO
HELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
  CASSIO.

CASSIO
SSIO. Well, I must leave her company.
  IAGO.

CASSIO
GO. Before me! look where she comes.
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
  BIANCA. 
1
CASSIO
ANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
  CASSIO. 
1
CASSIO
SSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

GO. And did you see the handkerchief?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was that mine?
  IAGO.

HELLO.                    Had it pleased heaven
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.           By heaven, you do me wrong.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Are not you a strumpet?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                       No, as I am a Christian.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, not a whore?

1
EMILIA
HELLO.                         I cry you mercy then;
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello. [Raises his voice.] You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. With who?
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. Who is thy lord?
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA.                     He that is yours, sweet lady.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA.                        Here's a change indeed!
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                      What's the matter, lady?
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                            What name, fair lady?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why did he so?
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                                 Beshrew him for't!
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA.                       Nay, heaven doth know.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO.                             Speak within door.
  EMILIA. 
1
EMILIA
ILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You are a fool; go to.
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA.                   O good Iago,
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
  DESDEMONA. 
1
EMILIA
SDEMONA. If 'twere no other-
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. 'Tis but so, I warrant.                      Trumpets within.
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
                                         Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. What in the contrary?
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You charge me most unjustly.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Well, go to, very well.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Very well.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. You have said now.
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. It hath not appeared.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. And that you would have me to do?
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
  RODERIGO. 
1
EMILIA
DERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
  IAGO. 
1
EMILIA
GO. And you shall be satisfied.                           Exeunt.

SDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                       Dismiss me?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,

0
ILIA. I would you had never seen him!
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        Come, come, you talk.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;

ILIA. Shall I go fetch your nightgown?

SDEMONA.                               No, unpin me here.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. A very handsome man.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. He speaks well.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. It's the wind.
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. [Sings.]
  EMILIA.

ILIA.                   'Tis neither here nor there.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.               There be some such, no question.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, would not you?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.                  No, by this heavenly light!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA.          In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
  DESDEMONA.

SDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
  RODERIGO. 
0
DERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
  CASSIO.

SSIO. That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
  RODERIGO.

DERIGO.                     O, I am slain!

SSIO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!

  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. What are you here that cry so grievously?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. I think that one of them is hereabout,
  IAGO.

IAGO
GO.                   O treacherous villains!
  RODERIGO. 
1
IAGO

  LODOVICO. 
1
IAGO
DOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. Signior Lodovico?
  LODOVICO.

IAGO
DOVICO. He, sir.
  IAGO.

  GRATIANO. 
1
IAGO
ATIANO. Cassio?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. How is't, brother?
  CASSIO. 
1
IAGO
SSIO. My leg is cut in two.

IAGO
GO.                         Marry, heaven forbid!
  BIANCA.

ANCA. What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO

  BIANCA.

IAGO
ANCA. O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,

IAGO
GO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
  CASSIO.

IAGO
GO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's well said:

IAGO
SSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man.
  IAGO. 
1
IAGO
GO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
  EMILIA.

HELLO.                        It is too late.     He stifles her.
  EMILIA.

ILIA. [Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!
  OTHELLO.

HELLO. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
  EMILIA.

ILIA. [Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                                      Who's there?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. [Within.] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. [Within.] I do beseech you
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What, now?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But now, my lord.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. It is the very error of the moon;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.           Roderigo kill'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.              No, Cassio is not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                   Alas, what cry is that?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. That? what?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice.
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. A guiltless death I die.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, who hath done this deed?
  DESDEMONA. 
0
SDEMONA. Nobody; I myself. Farewell;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Why, how should she be murther'd?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                                    Alas, who knows?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. You heard her say herself, it was not I.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                    O, the more angel she,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. She was false as water.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          Thou art rash as fire, to say
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. My husband?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Thy husband.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. That she was false to wedlock?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          My husband?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                        My husband?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                             He, woman;
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. If he say so, may his pernicious soul
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Ha!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Do thy worst;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                     Peace, you were best.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. What is the matter? How now, general?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. What is the matter?
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I told him what I thought, and told no more
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?
  IAGO. 
0
GO. I did.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
  IAGO. 
0
GO. With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
  ALL. 
0
L. O heavens forfend!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. And your reports have set the murther on.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. 'Tis a strange truth.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. O monstrous act!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                   Villainy, villainy, villainy!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. O! O! O!                                 Falls on the bed.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.           Nay, lay thee down and roar;
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.            [Rises.] O, she was foul!
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. 'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O heaven! O heavenly powers!
  IAGO. 
0
GO. 'Zounds! Hold your peace.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                         'Twill out, 'twill. I peace?
  IAGO.

GO. Be wise, and get you home.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.                          I will not.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO.                                    Fie!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak'st of
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Villainous whore!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
  IAGO. 
0
GO.                          Filth, thou liest!
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                  Are there not stones in heaven
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA. Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.          Exit Iago.
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
  MONTANO. 
0
NTANO. 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO.                   I am not valiant neither,
  EMILIA. 
0
ILIA.          What did thy song bode, lady?
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber;
  GRATIANO. 
0
ATIANO. [Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
  OTHELLO. 
0
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
  GRATIANO. 
1
GRATIANO
ATIANO. What is the matter?
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO.                      Behold, I have a weapon;
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. That's he that was Othello. Here I am.
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. Wrench his sword from him.
  IAGO. 
1
GRATIANO
GO.                                I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. O thou Othello, that wert once so good,
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO.                      Why, anything;
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. Ay.
  CASSIO. 
1
GRATIANO
SSIO. Dear general, I never gave you cause.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
  IAGO. 
1
GRATIANO
GO. Demand me nothing; what you know, you know.
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. What, not to pray?
  GRATIANO. 
1
GRATIANO
ATIANO.                    Torments will ope your lips.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. Well, thou dost best.
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. O villain!
  CASSIO. 
1
GRATIANO
SSIO.             Most heathenish and most gross!
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. Now here's another discontented paper,
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO.                     O the pernicious caitiff!
  CASSIO. 
1
GRATIANO
SSIO.               I found it in my chamber;
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO.                       O fool! fool! fool!
  CASSIO. 
1
GRATIANO
SSIO. There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. You must forsake this room, and go with us.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. Soft you; a word or two before you go.
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO. O bloody period!
  GRATIANO. 
1
GRATIANO
ATIANO.                  All that's spoke is marr'd.
  OTHELLO. 
1
GRATIANO
HELLO. I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee. No way but this,
  CASSIO. 
1
GRATIANO
SSIO. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
  LODOVICO. 
1
GRATIANO
DOVICO.         [To Iago.] O Spartan dog,
