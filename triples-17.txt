KING

DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
    Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,
    And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
    When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
    Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
    That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
    And make us heirs of all eternity.
    Therefore, brave conquerors- for so you are
    That war against your own affections
    And the huge army of the world's desires-
    Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
    Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
    Our court shall be a little Academe,
    Still and contemplative in living art.
    You three, Berowne, Dumain, and Longaville,
    Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
    My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
    That are recorded in this schedule here.
    Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
    That his own hand may strike his honour down
    That violates the smallest branch herein.
    If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
    Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.
    The mind shall banquet, though the body pine.
    Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits
    Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

DUMAIN
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
    The grosser manner of these world's delights
    He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;
    To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,
    With all these living in philosophy.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
I can but say their protestation over;
    So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
    That is, to live and study here three years.
    But there are other strict observances,
    As: not to see a woman in that term,
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
    And one day in a week to touch no food,
    And but one meal on every day beside,
    The which I hope is not enrolled there;
    And then to sleep but three hours in the night
    And not be seen to wink of all the day-
    When I was wont to think no harm all night,
    And make a dark night too of half the day-
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
    O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
    Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
    I only swore to study with your Grace,
    And stay here in your court for three years' space.

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
    What is the end of study, let me know.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Why, that to know which else we should not know.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
    To know the thing I am forbid to know,
    As thus: to study where I well may dine,
    When I to feast expressly am forbid;
    Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
    When mistresses from common sense are hid;
    Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,
    Study to break it, and not break my troth.
    If study's gain be thus, and this be so,
    Study knows that which yet it doth not know.
    Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
These be the stops that hinder study quite,
    And train our intellects to vain delight.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
    Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,
    As painfully to pore upon a book
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.
    Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;
    So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
    Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
    Study me how to please the eye indeed,
    By fixing it upon a fairer eye;
    Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,
    And give him light that it was blinded by.
    Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,
    That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;
    Small have continual plodders ever won,
    Save base authority from others' books.
    These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
    That give a name to every fixed star
    Have no more profit of their shining nights
    Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
    Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
    And every godfather can give a name.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
How well he's read, to reason against reading!

DUMAIN
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
How follows that?

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN
2
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
In reason nothing.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Something then in rhyme.

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
    That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
    Before the birds have any cause to sing?
    Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
    At Christmas I no more desire a rose
    Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows;
    But like of each thing that in season grows;
    So you, to study now it is too late,
    Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;
    And though I have for barbarism spoke more
    Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
    Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore,
    And bide the penance of each three years' day.
    Give me the paper; let me read the same;
    And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
[Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of
    my court'- Hath this been proclaimed?

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
Four days ago.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her
    tongue.' Who devis'd this penalty?

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
Marry, that did I.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Sweet lord, and why?

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
A dangerous law against gentility.
    [Reads] 'Item. If any man be seen to talk with a woman within
    the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the
    rest of the court can possibly devise.'
    This article, my liege, yourself must break;
    For well you know here comes in embassy
    The French king's daughter, with yourself to speak-
    A mild of grace and complete majesty-
    About surrender up of Aquitaine
    To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father;
    Therefore this article is made in vain,
    Or vainly comes th' admired princess hither.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
So study evermore is over-shot.
    While it doth study to have what it would,
    It doth forget to do the thing it should;
    And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
    'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
We must of force dispense with this decree;
    She must lie here on mere necessity.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Necessity will make us all forsworn
    Three thousand times within this three years' space;
    For every man with his affects is born,
    Not by might mast'red, but by special grace.
    If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:
    I am forsworn on mere necessity.
    So to the laws at large I write my name;        [Subscribes]
    And he that breaks them in the least degree
    Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
    Suggestions are to other as to me;
    But I believe, although I seem so loath,
    I am the last that will last keep his oath.
    But is there no quick recreation granted?

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
    With a refined traveller of Spain,
    A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
    That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
    One who the music of his own vain tongue
    Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
    A man of complements, whom right and wrong
    Have chose as umpire of their mutiny.
    This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
    For interim to our studies shall relate,
    In high-born words, the worth of many a knight
    From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
    How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
    But I protest I love to hear him lie,
    And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
    A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
    And so to study three years is but short.
      Enter DULL, a constable, with a letter, and COSTARD

DULL
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Which is the Duke's own person?

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
This, fellow. What wouldst?

DULL
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's
    farborough; but I would see his own person in flesh and blood.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
This is he.

DULL
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Signior Arme- Arme- commends you. There's villainy abroad;
    this letter will tell you more.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
A letter from the magnificent Armado.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
To hear, or forbear hearing?

LONGAVILLE
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to
    forbear both.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
    in the merriness.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
    The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
In what manner?

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was
    seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form,
    and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is in
    manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner- it is the
    manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form- in some form.

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
For the following, sir?

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the
    right!

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Will you hear this letter with attention?

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
As we would hear an oracle.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole
    dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god and body's fost'ring
    patron'-

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Not a word of Costard yet.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
[Reads] 'So it is'-

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling
    true, but so.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Peace!

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Be to me, and every man that dares not fight!

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
No words!

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I
    did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome
    physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook
    myself to walk. The time When? About the sixth hour; when beasts
    most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment
    which is called supper. So much for the time When. Now for the
    ground Which? which, I mean, I upon; it is ycleped thy park. Then
    for the place Where? where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene
    and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow-white pen
    the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest, beholdest,
    surveyest, or seest. But to the place Where? It standeth
    north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy
    curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain,
    that base minnow of thy mirth,'

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Me?

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Me?

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
'that shallow vassal,'

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Still me?

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
O, me!

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed
    edict and continent canon; which, with, O, with- but with this I
    passion to say wherewith-'

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
With a wench.
    King. 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy
    more sweet understanding, a woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed
    duty pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
    punishment, by thy sweet Grace's officer, Antony Dull, a man of
    good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation.'

DULL
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Me, an't shall please you; I am Antony Dull.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
'For Jaquenetta- so is the weaker vessel called, which I
    apprehended with the aforesaid swain- I keep her as a vessel of
    thy law's fury; and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice,
    bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and
    heart-burning heat of duty,
                                         DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

BEROWNE
2
DUMAIN
LONGAVILLE
This is not so well as I look'd for, but the best that
    ever I heard.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to
    this?

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Sir, I confess the wench.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Did you hear the proclamation?

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
    marking of it.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a
    wench.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Well, it was proclaimed damsel.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
This maid will serve my turn, sir.

KING
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week
    with bran and water.

COSTARD
2
DUMAIN
BEROWNE
LONGAVILLE
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

KING
0
BEROWNE
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
    My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o'er;
    And go we, lords, to put in practice that
    Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.

BEROWNE
0
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat
    These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
    Sirrah, come on.

COSTARD
0
BEROWNE
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken
    with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl; and therefore
    welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile
    again; and till then, sit thee down, sorrow.
                                                          Exeunt

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
    melancholy?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, no; O Lord, sir, no!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender
    juvenal?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Why tough signior? Why tough signior?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
    appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old
    time, which we may name tough.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Pretty and apt.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and
    my saying pretty?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Thou pretty, because little.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
And therefore apt, because quick.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Speak you this in my praise, master?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
In thy condign praise.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I will praise an eel with the same praise.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
that an eel is ingenious?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
That an eel is quick.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I am answer'd, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I love not to be cross'd.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I have promised to study three years with the Duke.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You may do it in an hour, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Impossible.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
How many is one thrice told?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete
    man.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
    amounts to.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
It doth amount to one more than two.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Which the base vulgar do call three.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
True.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three
    studied ere ye'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years'
    to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the
    dancing horse will tell you.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
A most fine figure!

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] To prove you a cipher.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
    a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing
    my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
    the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
    ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy. I
    think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort
    me, boy; what great men have been in love?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Hercules, master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;
    and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great
    carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a
    porter; and he was in love.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
    in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in
    love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A woman, master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Of what complexion?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the
    four.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Tell me precisely of what complexion.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Of the sea-water green, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Is that one of the four complexions?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
    of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He
    surely affected her for her wit.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
My love is most immaculate white and red.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such
    colours.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Define, define, well-educated infant.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!

MOTH
1
ARMADO
     If she be made of white and red,
               Her faults will ne'er be known;
             For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,
               And fears by pale white shown.
             Then if she fear, or be to blame,
               By this you shall not know;
             For still her cheeks possess the same
               Which native she doth owe.
    A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.

ARMADO

MOTH
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
    since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or if it were, it
    would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
    example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love
    that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind
    Costard; she deserves well.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
[Aside] To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I say, sing.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Forbear till this company be past.
                Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA

DULL
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and
    you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a
    must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at
    the park; she is allow'd for the day-woman. Fare you well.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

JAQUENETTA
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Man!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will visit thee at the lodge.

JAQUENETTA
1
MOTH
ARMADO
That's hereby.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I know where it is situate.

JAQUENETTA
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Lord, how wise you are!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I will tell thee wonders.

JAQUENETTA
1
MOTH
ARMADO
With that face?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I love thee.

JAQUENETTA
1
MOTH
ARMADO
So I heard you say.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
And so, farewell.

JAQUENETTA
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Fair weather after you!

DULL
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Fair weather after you!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
    pardoned.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full
    stomach.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Thou shalt be heavily punished.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but
    lightly rewarded.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Take away this villain; shut him up.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Come, you transgressing slave, away.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, sir; that were fast, and loose. Thou shalt to prison.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I
    have seen, some shall see.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
What shall some see?

COSTARD
0
ARMADO
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is
    not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore
    I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as
    another man, and therefore I can be quiet.

ARMADO

I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
    which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread.
    I shall be forsworn- which is a great argument of falsehood- if I
    love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted?
    Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but
    Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent
    strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
    Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club, and therefore
    too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second cause
    will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello
    he regards not; his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory
    is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum;
    for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me, some
    extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.
    Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

BOYET

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits.
    Consider who the King your father sends,
    To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
    Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
    To parley with the sole inheritor
    Of all perfections that a man may owe,
    Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
    Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
    Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
    As Nature was in making graces dear,
    When she did starve the general world beside
    And prodigally gave them all to you.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
    Needs not the painted flourish of your praise.
    Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
    Not utt'red by base sale of chapmen's tongues;
    I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
    Than you much willing to be counted wise
    In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
    But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
    You are not ignorant all-telling fame
    Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,
    Till painful study shall outwear three years,
    No woman may approach his silent court.
    Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
    Before we enter his forbidden gates,
    To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
    Bold of your worthiness, we single you
    As our best-moving fair solicitor.
    Tell him the daughter of the King of France,
    On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
    Importunes personal conference with his Grace.
    Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
    Like humble-visag'd suitors, his high will.

BOYET

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
Proud of employment, willingly I go.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.

FIRST LORD
-1
Lord Longaville is one.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Know you the man?

MARIA
-1
I know him, madam; at a marriage feast,
    Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
    Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
    In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.
    A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
    Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms;
    Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
    The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
    If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
    Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will,
    Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
    It should none spare that come within his power.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

MARIA
-1
They say so most that most his humours know.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Such short-liv'd wits do wither as they grow.
    Who are the rest?

KATHARINE
-1
The young Dumain, a well-accomplish'd youth,
    Of all that virtue love for virtue loved;
    Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,
    For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
    And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
    I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
    And much too little of that good I saw
    Is my report to his great worthiness.

ROSALINE
-1
Another of these students at that time
    Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
    Berowne they call him; but a merrier man,
    Within the limit of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal.
    His eye begets occasion for his wit,
    For every object that the one doth catch
    The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
    Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
    Delivers in such apt and gracious words
    That aged ears play truant at his tales,
    And younger hearings are quite ravished;
    So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
God bless my ladies! Are they all in love,
    That every one her own hath garnished
    With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

FIRST LORD
-1
Here comes Boyet.
                       Enter BOYET

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Now, what admittance, lord?

BOYET
-1
Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
    And he and his competitors in oath
    Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
    Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
    He rather means to lodge you in the field,
    Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
    Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
    To let you enter his unpeopled house.
                                    [The LADIES-IN-WAITING mask]
             Enter KING, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BEROWNE,
                         and ATTENDANTS
    Here comes Navarre.

KING
-1
Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I
    have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and
    welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

KING
-1
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
I will be welcome then; conduct me thither.

KING
-1
Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath-

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.

KING
-1
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Why, will shall break it; will, and nothing
    else.

KING
-1
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
    Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
    I hear your Grace hath sworn out house-keeping.
    'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
    And sin to break it.
    But pardon me, I am too sudden bold;
    To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
    Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
    And suddenly resolve me in my suit.         [Giving a paper]

KING
-1
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
YOU Will the sooner that I were away,
    For you'll prove perjur'd if you make me stay.

BEROWNE
-1
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

KATHARINE
-1
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

BEROWNE
-1
I know you did.

KATHARINE
-1
How needless was it then to ask the question!

BEROWNE
-1
You must not be so quick.

KATHARINE
-1
'Tis long of you, that spur me with such questions.

BEROWNE
-1
Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

KATHARINE
-1
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

BEROWNE
-1
What time o' day?

KATHARINE
-1
The hour that fools should ask.

BEROWNE
-1
Now fair befall your mask!

KATHARINE
-1
Fair fall the face it covers!

BEROWNE
-1
And send you many lovers!

KATHARINE
-1
Amen, so you be none.

BEROWNE
-1
Nay, then will I be gone.

KING
-1
Madam, your father here doth intimate
    The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
    Being but the one half of an entire sum
    Disbursed by my father in his wars.
    But say that he or we, as neither have,
    Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid
    A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
    One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
    Although not valued to the money's worth.
    If then the King your father will restore
    But that one half which is unsatisfied,
    We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
    And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.
    But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
    For here he doth demand to have repaid
    A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
    On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
    To have his title live in Aquitaine;
    Which we much rather had depart withal,
    And have the money by our father lent,
    Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
    Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
    From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
    A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
    And go well satisfied to France again.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
You do the King my father too much wrong,
    And wrong the reputation of your name,
    In so unseeming to confess receipt
    Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

KING
-1
I do protest I never heard of it;
    And, if you prove it, I'll repay it back
    Or yield up Aquitaine.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
We arrest your word.
    Boyet, you can produce acquittances
    For such a sum from special officers
    Of Charles his father.

KING
-1
Satisfy me so.

BOYET
-1
So please your Grace, the packet is not come,
    Where that and other specialties are bound;
    To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

KING
-1
It shall suffice me; at which interview
    All liberal reason I will yield unto.
    Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
    As honour, without breach of honour, may
    Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
    You may not come, fair Princess, within my gates;
    But here without you shall be so receiv'd
    As you shall deem yourself lodg'd in my heart,
    Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
    Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.
    To-morrow shall we visit you again.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Sweet health and fair desires consort your
    Grace!

KING
-1
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.
                                            Exit with attendants

BEROWNE
-1
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

ROSALINE
-1
Pray you, do my commendations;
    I would be glad to see it.

BEROWNE
-1
I would you heard it groan.

ROSALINE
-1
Is the fool sick?

BEROWNE
-1
Sick at the heart.

ROSALINE
-1
Alack, let it blood.

BEROWNE
-1
Would that do it good?

ROSALINE
-1
My physic says 'ay.'

BEROWNE
-1
Will YOU prick't with your eye?

ROSALINE
-1
No point, with my knife.

BEROWNE
-1
Now, God save thy life!

ROSALINE
-1
And yours from long living!

BEROWNE
-1
I cannot stay thanksgiving.                [Retiring]

DUMAIN
-1
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

BOYET
-1
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

DUMAIN
-1
A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.          Exit

LONGAVILLE
-1
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

BOYET
-1
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

LONGAVILLE
-1
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

BOYET
-1
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

LONGAVILLE
-1
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

BOYET
-1
Her mother's, I have heard.

LONGAVILLE
-1
God's blessing on your beard!

BOYET
-1
Good sir, be not offended;
    She is an heir of Falconbridge.

LONGAVILLE
-1
Nay, my choler is ended.
    She is a most sweet lady.

BOYET
-1
Nay, my choler is ended.
    She is a most sweet lady.

BEROWNE
-1
What's her name in the cap?

BOYET
-1
Rosaline, by good hap.

BEROWNE
-1
Is she wedded or no?

BOYET
-1
To her will, sir, or so.

BEROWNE
-1
You are welcome, sir; adieu!

BOYET
-1
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

MARIA
-1
That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;
    Not a word with him but a jest.

BOYET
-1
And every jest but a word.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
It was well done of you to take him at his
    word.

BOYET
-1
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

KATHARINE
-1
Two hot sheeps, marry!

BOYET
-1
And wherefore not ships?
    No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

KATHARINE
-1
You sheep and I pasture- shall that finish the jest?

BOYET
-1
So you grant pasture for me.     [Offering to kiss her]

KATHARINE
-1
Not so, gentle beast;
    My lips are no common, though several they be.

BOYET
-1
Belonging to whom?

KATHARINE
-1
To my fortunes and me.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
      agree;
    This civil war of wits were much better used
    On Navarre and his book-men, for here 'tis abused.

BOYET
-1
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
    By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
    Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
With what?

BOYET
-1
With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Your reason?

BOYET
-1
Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
    To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire.
    His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed,
    Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed;
    His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
    Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
    All senses to that sense did make their repair,
    To feel only looking on fairest of fair.
    Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
    As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
    Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,
    Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd.
    His face's own margent did quote such amazes
    That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
    I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
    An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.

BOYET
-1
But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd;
    I only have made a mouth of his eye,
    By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

MARIA
-1
Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.

KATHARINE
-1
He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.

ROSALINE
-1
Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but
    grim.

BOYET
-1
Do you hear, my mad wenches?

MARIA
-1
No.

BOYET
-1
What, then; do you see?

MARIA
-1
Ay, our way to be gone.

BOYET

MOTH
ARMADO
You are too hard for me.                         Exeunt

ARMADO

MOTH
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
                                         [MOTH sings Concolinel]

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give
    enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must
    employ him in a letter to my love.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How meanest thou? Brawling in French?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
    end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your
    eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the
    throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime
    through the nose, as if you snuff'd up love by smelling love,
    with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes, with
    your arms cross'd on your thin-belly doublet, like a rabbit on a
    spit, or your hands in your pocket, like a man after the old
    painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
    These are complements, these are humours; these betray nice
    wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men
    of note- do you note me?- that most are affected to these.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
How hast thou purchased this experience?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
By my penny of observation.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
But O- but O-

MOTH
1
ARMADO
The hobby-horse is forgot.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love
    perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Almost I had.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Negligent student! learn her by heart.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
By heart and in heart, boy.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
What wilt thou prove?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
    instant. By heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by
    her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with
    her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you
    cannot enjoy her.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I am all these three.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an
    ass.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Ha, ha, what sayest thou?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
    very slow-gaited. But I go.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The way is but short; away.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
As swift as lead, sir.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
    Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I say lead is slow.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
    Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
    He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he;
    I shoot thee at the swain.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Thump, then, and I flee.                            Exit

ARMADO
1
MOTH
A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
    By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face;
    Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
    My herald is return'd.
                       Enter MOTH with COSTARD

MOTH
1
ARMADO
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
    O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain; no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no
    salve, sir, but a plantain!

ARMADO
1
MOTH
By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
    spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous
    smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take
    salve for l'envoy, and the word 'l'envoy' for a salve?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?

ARMADO
1
MOTH
No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
    Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
    I will example it:
           The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
           Were still at odds, being but three.
    There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.

ARMADO

MOTH

   Until the goose came out of door,
           And stay'd the odds by adding four.
    Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my l'envoy.
           The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
           Were still at odds, being but three.

 Until the goose came out of door,
           Staying the odds by adding four.

MOTH

A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?

COSTARD

MOTH
ARMADO
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
    Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
    To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose;
    Let me see: a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
    Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
    Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
    And he ended the market.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?

MOTH
1
ARMADO
I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
      l'envoy.
    I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
    Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
Till there be more matter in the shin.

ARMADO

MOTH
Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD

O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
    goose, in this.

ARMADO

MOTH
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
    enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured, restrained,
    captivated, bound.

COSTARD
1
MOTH
ARMADO
True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
    loose.

ARMADO
1
MOTH
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
    lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: bear this
    significant [giving a letter] to the country maid Jaquenetta;
    there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honour is
    rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.                  Exit

And I, forsooth, in love; I, that have been love's whip;

    Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
    This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
    This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
    Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,

    Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
    Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
    Sole imperator, and great general
    Of trotting paritors. O my little heart!
    And I to be a corporal of his field,
    And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
    What! I love, I sue, I seek a wife-
    A woman, that is like a German clock,
    Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
    And never going aright, being a watch,
    But being watch'd that it may still go right!
    Nay, to be perjur'd, which is worst of all;
    And, among three, to love the worst of all,
    A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
    With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes;
    Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed,
    Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
    And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
    To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
    That Cupid will impose for my neglect
    Of his almighty dreadful little might.
    Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan:
    Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.              Exit

    A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
    But come, the bow. Now mercy goes to kill,
    And shooting well is then accounted ill;
    Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
    Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
    If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
    That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
    And, out of question, so it is sometimes:
    Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
    When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
    We bend to that the working of the heart;
    As I for praise alone now seek to spill
    The poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill.

[Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible;
    true that thou art beauteous; truth itself that thou art lovely.
    More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth
    itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal. The
    magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the
    pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon; and he it was that
    might rightly say, 'Veni, vidi, vici'; which to annothanize in
    the vulgar,- O base and obscure vulgar!- videlicet, He came, saw,
    and overcame. He came, one; saw, two; overcame, three. Who came?-
    the king. Why did he come?- to see. Why did he see?-to overcome.
    To whom came he?- to the beggar. What saw he?- the beggar. Who
    overcame he?- the beggar. The conclusion is victory; on whose
    side?- the king's. The captive is enrich'd; on whose side?- the
    beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial; on whose side?- the
    king's. No, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so
    stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy
    lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy
    love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou
    exchange for rags?- robes, for tittles?- titles, for thyself?
    -me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my
    eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part.
                  Thine in the dearest design of industry,
                                           DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.
    'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
    'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey;

    Armado a th' t'one side- O, a most dainty man!
    To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!

The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as

Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,

I Will something affect the letter, for it argues
    facility.
    The preyful Princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing
      pricket.
    Some say a sore; but not a sore till now made sore with shooting.
    The dogs did yell; put el to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket-
    Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
    If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores o' sorel.

This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish

[Reads] 'If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to
      love?
    Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed!
    Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove;
    Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.
    Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,
    Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.
    If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;
    All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
    Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire.
    Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
    Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
    Celestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,
    That singes heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.'

You find not the apostrophas, and so miss the accent:
    let me supervise the canzonet. Here are only numbers ratified;
    but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy,
    caret. Ovidius Naso was the man. And why, indeed, 'Naso' but for
    smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of
    invention? Imitari is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the
    ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
    was this directed to you?

I will overglance the superscript: 'To the snow-white

    the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party
    writing to the person written unto: 'Your Ladyship's in all
    desired employment, Berowne.' Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one
    of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a letter
    to a sequent of the stranger queen's which accidentally, or by
    the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my sweet;

    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not

      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,

        Love, whose month is ever May,
        Spied a blossom passing fair
        Playing in the wanton air.
        Through the velvet leaves the wind,
        All unseen, can passage find;
        That the lover, sick to death,
        Wish'd himself the heaven's breath.
        "Air," quoth he "thy cheeks may blow;
        Air, would I might triumph so!
        But, alack, my hand is sworn
        Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
        Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
        Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.
        Do not call it sin in me
        That I am forsworn for thee;
        Thou for whom Jove would swear
        Juno but an Ethiope were;
        And deny himself for Jove,

[Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity,

KING

BEROWNE
[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his, your case is such.
    You chide at him, offending twice as much:
    You do not love Maria! Longaville
    Did never sonnet for her sake compile;
    Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
    His loving bosom, to keep down his heart.
    I have been closely shrouded in this bush,
    And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.
    I heard your guilty rhymes, observ'd your fashion,
    Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.
    'Ay me!' says one. 'O Jove!' the other cries.
    One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other's eyes.
    [To LONGAVILLE] You would for paradise break faith and troth;
    [To Dumain] And Jove for your love would infringe an oath.
    What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
    Faith infringed which such zeal did swear?
    How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!
    How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!
    For all the wealth that ever I did see,
    I would not have him know so much by me.

[Descending] Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy,
    Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me.
    Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove
    These worms for loving, that art most in love?
    Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
    There is no certain princess that appears;
    You'll not be perjur'd; 'tis a hateful thing;
    Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting.
    But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not,
    All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
    You found his mote; the King your mote did see;
    But I a beam do find in each of three.
    O, what a scene of fool'ry have I seen,
    Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!
    O, me, with what strict patience have I sat,
    To see a king transformed to a gnat!
    To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
    And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
    And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
    And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
    Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?

'Tis more than need.
    Have at you, then, affection's men-at-arms.
    Consider what you first did swear unto:
    To fast, to study, and to see no woman-
    Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
    Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,
    And abstinence engenders maladies.
    And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords,
    In that each of you have forsworn his book,
    Can you still dream, and pore, and thereon look?
    For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
    Have found the ground of study's excellence
    Without the beauty of a woman's face?
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
    They are the ground, the books, the academes,
    From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.
    Why, universal plodding poisons up
    The nimble spirits in the arteries,
    As motion and long-during action tires
    The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
    Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
    You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,
    And study too, the causer of your vow;
    For where is author in the world
    Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
    Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,
    And where we are our learning likewise is;
    Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
    With ourselves.
    Do we not likewise see our learning there?
    O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
    And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
    For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
    In leaden contemplation have found out
    Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
    Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
    Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
    And therefore, finding barren practisers,
    Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
    But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
    Lives not alone immured in the brain,
    But with the motion of all elements
    Courses as swift as thought in every power,
    And gives to every power a double power,
    Above their functions and their offices.
    It adds a precious seeing to the eye:
    A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
    A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
    When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd.
    Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
    Than are the tender horns of cockled snails:
    Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
    For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
    Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
    Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
    As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair.
    And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
    Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
    Never durst poet touch a pen to write
    Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs;
    O, then his lines would ravish savage ears,
    And plant in tyrants mild humility.
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.
    They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
    They are the books, the arts, the academes,
    That show, contain, and nourish, all the world,
    Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
    Then fools you were these women to forswear;
    Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
    For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love;
    Or for Love's sake, a word that loves all men;
    Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;
    Or women's sake, by whom we men are men-
    Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
    Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
    It is religion to be thus forsworn;
    For charity itself fulfils the law,
    And who can sever love from charity?

First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
    Then homeward every man attach the hand
    Of his fair mistress. In the afternoon
    We will with some strange pastime solace them,
    Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
    For revels, dances, masks, and merry hours,
    Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have
    been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty
    without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without
    opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam
    day with a companion of the King's who is intituled, nominated,
    or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

HOLOFERNES

NATHANIEL
DULL
Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his
    discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his
    gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and
    thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd,
    as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

NATHANIEL

HOLOFERNES

A most singular and choice epithet.

He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than
    the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes,
    such insociable and point-devise companions; such rackers of
    orthography, as to speak 'dout' fine, when he should say 'doubt';
    'det' when he should pronounce 'debt'- d, e, b, t, not d, e, t.
    He clepeth a calf 'cauf,' half 'hauf'; neighbour vocatur
    'nebour'; 'neigh' abbreviated 'ne.' This is abhominable- which he
    would call 'abbominable.' It insinuateth me of insanie: ne

    this day; which the rude multitude call the afternoon.

HOLOFERNES

NATHANIEL
DULL
The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable,

ARMADO

HOLOFERNES
NATHANIEL
DULL
Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do
    assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let
    it pass. I do beseech thee, remember thy courtesy. I beseech
    thee, apparel thy head. And among other importunate and most
    serious designs, and of great import indeed, too- but let that
    pass; for I must tell thee it will please his Grace, by the
    world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal
    finger thus dally with my excrement, with my mustachio; but,
    sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable:
    some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart
    to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world;
    but let that pass. The very all of all is- but, sweet heart, I do
    implore secrecy- that the King would have me present the
    Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show,
    or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the
    curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden
    breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal,
    to the end to crave your assistance.

HOLOFERNES

NATHANIEL
DULL
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
    Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
    show in the posterior of this day, to be rend'red by our
    assistance, the King's command, and this most gallant,
    illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess- I say
    none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.

NATHANIEL
2
HOLOFERNES
DULL
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?

HOLOFERNES
2
NATHANIEL
DULL
Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant
    gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
    limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.

ARMADO
2
HOLOFERNES
NATHANIEL
DULL
Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for that
    Worthy's thumb; he is not so big as the end of his club.

HOLOFERNES
2
NATHANIEL
DULL
Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in
    minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I
    will have an apology for that purpose.

MOTH
2
HOLOFERNES
NATHANIEL
DULL
An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may
    cry 'Well done, Hercules; now thou crushest the snake!' That is
    the way to make an offence gracious, though few have the grace to
    do it.

ARMADO

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
    If fairings come thus plentifully in.
    A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
    Look you what I have from the loving King.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Madam, came nothing else along with that?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
    As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
    Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
    That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
That was the way to make his godhead wax;
    For he hath been five thousand year a boy.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
    And so she died. Had she been light, like you,
    Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
    She might 'a been a grandam ere she died.
    And so may you; for a light heart lives long.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
A light condition in a beauty dark.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
We need more light to find your meaning out.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
    Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
So do not you; for you are a light wench.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
    But, Rosaline, you have a favour too?
    Who sent it? and what is it?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
I would you knew.
    An if my face were but as fair as yours,
    My favour were as great: be witness this.
    Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;
    The numbers true, and, were the numb'ring too,
    I were the fairest goddess on the ground.
    I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs.
    O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Anything like?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
    My red dominical, my golden letter:
    O that your face were not so full of O's!

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
    Dumain?

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Madam, this glove.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Did he not send you twain?

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Yes, madam; and, moreover,
    Some thousand verses of a faithful lover;
    A huge translation of hypocrisy,
    Vilely compil'd, profound simplicity.

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
    The letter is too long by half a mile.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
    The chain were longer and the letter short?

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
    That same Berowne I'll torture ere I go.
    O that I knew he were but in by th' week!
    How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,
    And wait the season, and observe the times,
    And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,
    And shape his service wholly to my hests,
    And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
    So pertaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
    That he should be my fool, and I his fate.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
None are so surely caught, when they are
      catch'd,
    As wit turn'd fool; folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
    Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school,
    And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
    As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
                          Enter BOYET

MARIA
Thy news, Boyet?

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Prepare, madam, prepare!
    Arm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are
    Against your peace. Love doth approach disguis'd,
    Armed in arguments; you'll be surpris'd.
    Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
    Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
    That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
    I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
    When, lo, to interrupt my purpos'd rest,
    Toward that shade I might behold addrest
    The King and his companions; warily
    I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
    And overheard what you shall overhear-
    That, by and by, disguis'd they will be here.
    Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
    That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage.
    Action and accent did they teach him there:
    'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
    And ever and anon they made a doubt
    Presence majestical would put him out;
    'For' quoth the King 'an angel shalt thou see;
    Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
    The boy replied 'An angel is not evil;
    I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
    With that all laugh'd, and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
    Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.
    One rubb'd his elbow, thus, and fleer'd, and swore
    A better speech was never spoke before.
    Another with his finger and his thumb
    Cried 'Via! we will do't, come what will come.'
    The third he caper'd, and cried 'All goes well.'
    The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
    With that they all did tumble on the ground,
    With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
    That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
    To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
But what, but what, come they to visit us?

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
    Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
    Their purpose is to parley, court, and dance;
    And every one his love-feat will advance
    Unto his several mistress; which they'll know
    By favours several which they did bestow.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
    For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
    And not a man of them shall have the grace,
    Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
    Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
    And then the King will court thee for his dear;
    Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
    So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.
    And change you favours too; so shall your loves
    Woo contrary, deceiv'd by these removes.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
But, in this changing, what is your intent?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
    They do it but in mocking merriment,
    And mock for mock is only my intent.
    Their several counsels they unbosom shall
    To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
    Upon the next occasion that we meet
    With visages display'd to talk and greet.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
    Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;
    But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
    And quite divorce his memory from his part.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
    The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out.
    There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
    To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own;
    So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
    And they well mock'd depart away with shame.
                                         [Trumpet sounds within]

BOYET

The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Once to behold, rogue.

MOTH
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
    sun-beamed eyes-

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
They will not answer to that epithet;
    You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

MOTH
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
    If they do speak our language, 'tis our will
    That some plain man recount their purposes.
    Know what they would.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
What would you with the Princess?

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
What would they, say they?

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
She says you have it, and you may be gone.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Say to her we have measur'd many miles
    To tread a measure with her on this grass.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
They say that they have measur'd many a mile
    To tread a measure with you on this grass.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
It is not so. Ask them how many inches
    Is in one mile? If they have measured many,
    The measure, then, of one is eas'ly told.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
    And many miles, the Princess bids you tell
    How many inches doth fill up one mile.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Tell her we measure them by weary steps.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
She hears herself.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
How many weary steps
    Of many weary miles you have o'ergone
    Are numb'red in the travel of one mile?

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
We number nothing that we spend for you;
    Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
    That we may do it still without accompt.
    Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
    That we, like savages, may worship it.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
    Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
    Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
    Thou now requests but moonshine in the water.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
    Thou bid'st me beg; this begging is not strange.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
    Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
    The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Our ears vouchsafe it.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
But your legs should do it.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
    We'll not be nice; take hands. We will not dance.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Why take we hands then?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Only to part friends.
    Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
More measure of this measure; be not nice.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
We can afford no more at such a price.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Price you yourselves. What buys your company?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Your absence only.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
That can never be.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
    Twice to your visor and half once to you.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
In private then.

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
    Metheglin, wort, and malmsey; well run dice!
    There's half a dozen sweets.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Seventh sweet, adieu!
    Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
One word in secret.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Let it not be sweet.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Thou grievest my gall.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Gall! bitter.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Therefore meet.                 [They converse apart]

DUMAIN
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Name it.

DUMAIN
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Fair lady-

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Say you so? Fair lord-
    Take that for your fair lady.

DUMAIN
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Please it you,
    As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
                                           [They converse apart]

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
I know the reason, lady, why you ask.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
You have a double tongue within your mask,
    And would afford my speechless vizard half.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
A calf, fair lady!

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
No, a fair lord calf.

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Let's part the word.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
No, I'll not be your half.
    Take all and wean it; it may prove an ox.

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
    Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.

LONGAVILLE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
One word in private with you ere I die.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.
                                           [They converse apart]

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
    As is the razor's edge invisible,
    Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
    Above the sense of sense; so sensible
    Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings,
    Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

BEROWNE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

KING
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
    Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
    Will they not, think you, hang themselves to-night?
    Or ever but in vizards show their faces?
    This pert Berowne was out of count'nance quite.

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
They were all in lamentable cases!
    The King was weeping-ripe for a good word.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
    'No point' quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
    And trow you what he call'd me?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Qualm, perhaps.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
Yes, in good faith.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Go, sickness as thou art!

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
    But will you hear? The King is my love sworn.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.

KATHARINE
2
ROSALINE
MARIA
And Longaville was for my service born.

MARIA
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
    Immediately they will again be here
    In their own shapes; for it can never be
    They will digest this harsh indignity.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Will they return?

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
They will, they will, God knows,
    And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows;
    Therefore, change favours; and, when they repair,
    Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:
    Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
    Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
    If they return in their own shapes to woo?

ROSALINE
2
KATHARINE
MARIA
Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,
    Let's mock them still, as well known as disguis'd.
    Let us complain to them what fools were here,
    Disguis'd like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
    And wonder what they were, and to what end
    Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd,
    And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
    Should be presented at our tent to us.

BOYET
2
KATHARINE
ROSALINE
MARIA
Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

KING
-1
Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?

BOYET
-1
Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
    Command me any service to her thither?

KING
-1
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

BOYET
-1
I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.          Exit

BEROWNE
-1
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
    And utters it again when God doth please.
    He is wit's pedlar, and retails his wares
    At wakes, and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
    And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
    Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
    This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
    Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.
    'A can carve too, and lisp; why this is he
    That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
    This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,
    That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
    In honourable terms; nay, he can sing
    A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
    Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet;
    The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.
    This is the flow'r that smiles on every one,
    To show his teeth as white as whales-bone;
    And consciences that will not die in debt
    Pay him the due of 'honey-tongued Boyet.'

KING
-1
A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
    That put Armado's page out of his part!
        Enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE,
                      MARIA, and KATHARINE

BEROWNE
-1
See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
    Till this man show'd thee? And what art thou now?

KING
-1
All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

KING
-1
Construe my speeches better, if you may.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

KING
-1
We came to visit you, and purpose now
    To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
    Nor God, nor I, delights in perjur'd men.

KING
-1
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
    The virtue of your eye must break my oath.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
You nickname virtue: vice you should have
      spoke;
    For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
    Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
    As the unsullied lily, I protest,
    A world of torments though I should endure,
    I would not yield to be your house's guest;
    So much I hate a breaking cause to be
    Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.

KING
-1
O, you have liv'd in desolation here,
    Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
    We have had pastimes here, and pleasant game;
    A mess of Russians left us but of late.

KING
-1
How, madam! Russians!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Ay, in truth, my lord;
    Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

ROSALINE
-1
Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
    My lady, to the manner of the days,
    In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
    We four indeed confronted were with four
    In Russian habit; here they stayed an hour
    And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
    They did not bless us with one happy word.
    I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
    When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

BEROWNE
-1
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
    Your wit makes wise things foolish; when we greet,
    With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
    By light we lose light; your capacity
    Is of that nature that to your huge store
    Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

ROSALINE
-1
This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-

BEROWNE
-1
I am a fool, and full of poverty.

ROSALINE
-1
But that you take what doth to you belong,
    It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

BEROWNE
-1
O, I am yours, and all that I possess.

ROSALINE
-1
All the fool mine?

BEROWNE
-1
I cannot give you less.

ROSALINE
-1
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

BEROWNE
-1
Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?

ROSALINE
-1
There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
    That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

KING
-1
We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.

DUMAIN
-1
Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?

ROSALINE
-1
Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
    Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

BEROWNE
-1
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
    Can any face of brass hold longer out?
    Here stand I, lady- dart thy skill at me,
    Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,
    Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,
    Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
    And I will wish thee never more to dance,
    Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
    O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
    Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue,
    Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
    Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song.
    Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
    Three-pil'd hyperboles, spruce affectation,
    Figures pedantical- these summer-flies
    Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.
    I do forswear them; and I here protest,
    By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!-
    Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
    In russet yeas, and honest kersey noes.
    And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-
    My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

ROSALINE
-1
Sans 'sans,' I pray you.

BEROWNE
-1
Yet I have a trick
    Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick;
    I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see-
    Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
    They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
    They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.
    These lords are visited; you are not free,
    For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

BEROWNE
-1
Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.

ROSALINE
-1
It is not so; for how can this be true,
    That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

BEROWNE
-1
Peace; for I will not have to do with you.

ROSALINE
-1
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

BEROWNE
-1
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

KING
-1
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
    Some fair excuse.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
The fairest is confession.
    Were not you here but even now, disguis'd?

KING
-1
Madam, I was.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
And were you well advis'd?

KING
-1
I was, fair madam.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
When you then were here,
    What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

KING
-1
That more than all the world I did respect her.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
When she shall challenge this, you will reject
    her.

KING
-1
Upon mine honour, no.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Peace, peace, forbear;
    Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

KING
-1
Despise me when I break this oath of mine.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
    What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

ROSALINE
-1
Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
    As precious eyesight, and did value me
    Above this world; adding thereto, moreover,
    That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
God give thee joy of him! The noble lord
     Most honourably doth uphold his word.

KING
-1
What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,
    I never swore this lady such an oath.

ROSALINE
-1
By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,
    You gave me this; but take it, sir, again.

KING
-1
My faith and this the Princess I did give;
    I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
    And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.
    What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
    I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
    Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
    To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
    Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
    Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
    That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
    To make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd,
    Told our intents before; which once disclos'd,
    The ladies did change favours; and then we,
    Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
    Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
    We are again forsworn in will and error.
    Much upon this it is; [To BOYET] and might not you
    Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
    Do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier,
    And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
    And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
    Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
    You put our page out. Go, you are allow'd;
    Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
    You leer upon me, do you? There's an eye
    Wounds like a leaden sword.

BOYET
-1
Full merrily
    Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

BEROWNE
-1
Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace; I have done.
                          Enter COSTARD
    Welcome, pure wit! Thou part'st a fair fray.

COSTARD
-1
O Lord, sir, they would know
     Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no?

BEROWNE
-1
What, are there but three?

COSTARD
-1
No, sir; but it is vara fine,
    For every one pursents three.

BEROWNE
-1
And three times thrice is nine.

COSTARD
-1
Not so, sir; under correction, sir,
    I hope it is not so.
    You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we
      know;
    I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir-

BEROWNE
-1
Is not nine.

COSTARD
-1
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

BEROWNE
-1
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

COSTARD
-1
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by
    reck'ning, sir.

BEROWNE
-1
How much is it?

COSTARD
-1
O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will
    show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they
    say, but to parfect one man in one poor man, Pompion the Great,
    sir.

BEROWNE
-1
Art thou one of the Worthies?

COSTARD
-1
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great;
    for mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy; but I am
    to stand for him.

BEROWNE
-1
Go, bid them prepare.

COSTARD
-1
We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

KING
-1
Berowne, they will shame us; let them not approach.

BEROWNE
-1
We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy
    To have one show worse than the King's and his company.

KING
-1
I say they shall not come.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.
    That sport best pleases that doth least know how;
    Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
    Dies in the zeal of that which it presents.
    Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
    When great things labouring perish in their birth.

BEROWNE
-1
A right description of our sport, my lord.
                        Enter ARMADO

ARMADO
-1
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
    breath as will utter a brace of words.
           [Converses apart with the KING, and delivers a paper]

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Doth this man serve God?

BEROWNE
-1
Why ask you?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
'A speaks not like a man of God his making.

ARMADO
-1
That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I
    protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too too vain,
    too too vain; but we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la
    guerra. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

KING
-1
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents
    Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate,
    Alexander; Arinado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas
    Maccabaeus.
    And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
    These four will change habits and present the other five.

BEROWNE
-1
There is five in the first show.

KING
-1
You are deceived, 'tis not so.

BEROWNE
-1
The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and
    the boy:
    Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
    Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

KING
-1
The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
                   Enter COSTARD, armed for POMPEY

COSTARD
-1
I Pompey am-

BEROWNE
-1
You lie, you are not he.

COSTARD
-1
I Pompey am-

BOYET
-1
With libbard's head on knee.

BEROWNE
-1
Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee.

COSTARD
-1
I Pompey am, Pompey surnam'd the Big-

COSTARD
-1
It is Great, sir.
    Pompey surnam'd the Great,
    That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to
      sweat;
    And travelling along this coast, I bere am come by chance,
    And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France.
    If your ladyship would say 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Great thanks, great Pompey.

COSTARD
-1
'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect.
    I made a little fault in Great.

BEROWNE
-1
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
                 Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for ALEXANDER

NATHANIEL
-1
When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander;
    By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might.
    My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander-

BOYET
-1
Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right.

BEROWNE
-1
Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling
    knight.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good
    Alexander.

NATHANIEL
-1
When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander-

BOYET
-1
Most true, 'tis right, you were so, Alisander.

BEROWNE
-1
Pompey the Great!

COSTARD
-1
Your servant, and Costard.

BEROWNE
-1
Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

COSTARD
-1
[To Sir Nathaniel] O, Sir, you have overthrown Alisander
    the conqueror! You will be scrap'd out of the painted cloth for
    this. Your lion, that holds his poleaxe sitting on a close-stool,
    will be given to Ajax. He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror
    and afeard to speak! Run away for shame, Alisander.
    [Sir Nathaniel retires] There, an't shall please you, a foolish
    mild man; an honest man, look you, and soon dash'd. He is a
    marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good bowler; but for
    Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted. But there
    are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Stand aside, good Pompey.
         Enter HOLOFERNES, for JUDAS; and MOTH, for HERCULES

HOLOFERNES
-1
Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
    Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canus;
    And when be was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
    Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
    Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
    Ergo I come with this apology.
    Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.      [MOTH retires]
    Judas I am-

DUMAIN
-1
A Judas!

HOLOFERNES
-1
Not Iscariot, sir.
    Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.

DUMAIN
-1
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

BEROWNE
-1
A kissing traitor. How art thou prov'd Judas?

HOLOFERNES
-1
Judas I am-

DUMAIN
-1
The more shame for you, Judas!

HOLOFERNES
-1
What mean you, sir?

BOYET
-1
To make Judas hang himself.

HOLOFERNES
-1
Begin, sir; you are my elder.

BEROWNE
-1
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

HOLOFERNES
-1
I will not be put out of countenance.

BEROWNE
-1
Because thou hast no face.

HOLOFERNES
-1
What is this?

BOYET
-1
A cittern-head.

DUMAIN
-1
The head of a bodkin.

BEROWNE
-1
A death's face in a ring.

LONGAVILLE
-1
The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.

BOYET
-1
The pommel of Coesar's falchion.

DUMAIN
-1
The carv'd-bone face on a flask.

BEROWNE
-1
Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

DUMAIN
-1
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

BEROWNE
-1
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now,
    forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

HOLOFERNES
-1
You have put me out of countenance.

BEROWNE
-1
False: we have given thee faces.

HOLOFERNES
-1
But you have outfac'd them all.

BEROWNE
-1
An thou wert a lion we would do so.

BOYET
-1
Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
    And so adieu, sweet Jude! Nay, why dost thou stay?

DUMAIN
-1
For the latter end of his name.

BEROWNE
-1
For the ass to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away.

HOLOFERNES
-1
This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.

BOYET
-1
A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark, he may stumble.
                                            [HOLOFERNES retires]

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
                   Enter ARMADO, for HECTOR

BEROWNE
-1
Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.

DUMAIN
-1
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.

KING
-1
Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.

BOYET
-1
But is this Hector?

DUMAIN
-1
I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.

LONGAVILLE
-1
His leg is too big for Hector's.

DUMAIN
-1
More calf, certain.

BOYET
-1
No; he is best indued in the small.

BEROWNE
-1
This cannot be Hector.

DUMAIN
-1
He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.

ARMADO
-1
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
    Gave Hector a gift-

DUMAIN
-1
A gilt nutmeg.

BEROWNE
-1
A lemon.

LONGAVILLE
-1
Stuck with cloves.

DUMAIN
-1
No, cloven.

ARMADO
-1
Peace!
    The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
    Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
    A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
    From morn till night out of his pavilion.
    I am that flower-

DUMAIN
-1
That mint.

LONGAVILLE
-1
That columbine.

ARMADO
-1
Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.

LONGAVILLE
-1
I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against
    Hector.

DUMAIN
-1
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.

ARMADO
-1
The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, beat
    not the bones of the buried; when he breathed, he was a man. But
    I will forward with my device. [To the PRINCESS] Sweet royalty,
    bestow on me the sense of hearing.
          [BEROWNE steps forth, and speaks to COSTARD]

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Speak, brave Hector; we are much delighted.

ARMADO
-1
I do adore thy sweet Grace's slipper.

BOYET
-1
[Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot.

DUMAIN
-1
[Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.

ARMADO
-1
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-

COSTARD
-1
The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she is two
    months on her way.

ARMADO
-1
What meanest thou?

COSTARD
-1
Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench
    is cast away. She's quick; the child brags in her belly already;
    'tis yours.

ARMADO
-1
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.

COSTARD
-1
Then shall Hector be whipt for Jaquenetta that is quick by
    him, and hang'd for Pompey that is dead by him.

DUMAIN
-1
Most rare Pompey!

BOYET
-1
Renowned Pompey!

BEROWNE
-1
Greater than Great! Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the
    Huge!

DUMAIN
-1
Hector trembles.

BEROWNE
-1
Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on! stir
    them on!

DUMAIN
-1
Hector will challenge him.

BEROWNE
-1
Ay, if 'a have no more man's blood in his belly than will
    sup a flea.

ARMADO
-1
By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.

COSTARD
-1
I will not fight with a pole, like a Northern man; I'll
    slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you, let me borrow my
    arms again.

DUMAIN
-1
Room for the incensed Worthies!

COSTARD
-1
I'll do it in my shirt.

DUMAIN
-1
Most resolute Pompey!

MOTH
-1
Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see
    Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean you? You will lose
    your reputation.

ARMADO
-1
Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my
    shirt.

DUMAIN
-1
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.

ARMADO
-1
Sweet bloods, I both may and will.

BEROWNE
-1
What reason have you for 't?

ARMADO
-1
The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
    for penance.

BOYET
-1
True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;
    since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of
    Jaquenetta's, and that 'a wears next his heart for a favour.
                 Enter as messenger, MONSIEUR MARCADE

MARCADE
-1
God save you, madam!

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Welcome, Marcade;
    But that thou interruptest our merriment.

MARCADE
-1
I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
    Is heavy in my tongue. The King your father-

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Dead, for my life!

MARCADE
-1
Even so; my tale is told.

BEROWNE
-1
WOrthies away; the scene begins to cloud.

ARMADO
-1
For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
    day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will

KING
-1
How fares your Majesty?

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Boyet, prepare; I will away to-night.

KING
-1
Madam, not so; I do beseech you stay.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
    For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,
    Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
    In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
    The liberal opposition of our spirits,
    If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
    In the converse of breath- your gentleness
    Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord.
    A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
    Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
    For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

KING
-1
The extreme parts of time extremely forms
    All causes to the purpose of his speed;
    And often at his very loose decides
    That which long process could not arbitrate.
    And though the mourning brow of progeny
    Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
    The holy suit which fain it would convince,
    Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
    Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
    From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost
    Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
    As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
I understand you not; my griefs are double.

BEROWNE
-1
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
    And by these badges understand the King.
    For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
    Play'd foul play with our oaths; your beauty, ladies,
    Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours
    Even to the opposed end of our intents;
    And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,
    As love is full of unbefitting strains,
    All wanton as a child, skipping and vain;
    Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
    Full of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms,
    Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
    To every varied object in his glance;
    Which parti-coated presence of loose love
    Put on by us, if in your heavenly eyes
    Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities,
    Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
    Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
    Our love being yours, the error that love makes
    Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false,
    By being once false for ever to be true
    To those that make us both- fair ladies, you;
    And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
    Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
    Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
    And, in our maiden council, rated them
    At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,
    As bombast and as lining to the time;
    But more devout than this in our respects
    Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
    In their own fashion, like a merriment.

DUMAIN
-1
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

LONGAVILLE
-1
So did our looks.

ROSALINE
-1
We did not quote them so.

KING
-1
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
    Grant us your loves.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
A time, methinks, too short
    To make a world-without-end bargain in.
    No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjur'd much,
    Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this,
    If for my love, as there is no such cause,
    You will do aught- this shall you do for me:
    Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
    To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
    Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
    There stay until the twelve celestial signs
    Have brought about the annual reckoning.
    If this austere insociable life
    Change not your offer made in heat of blood,
    If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,
    Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
    But that it bear this trial, and last love,
    Then, at the expiration of the year,
    Come, challenge me, challenge me by these deserts;
    And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
    I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut
    My woeful self up in a mournful house,
    Raining the tears of lamentation
    For the remembrance of my father's death.
    If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
    Neither intitled in the other's heart.

KING
-1
If this, or more than this, I would deny,
    To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
    The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
    Hence hermit then, my heart is in thy breast.

BEROWNE
-1
And what to me, my love? and what to me?

ROSALINE
-1
You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;
    You are attaint with faults and perjury;
    Therefore, if you my favour mean to get,
    A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
    But seek the weary beds of people sick.

DUMAIN
-1
But what to me, my love? but what to me?
    A wife?

KATHARINE
-1
A beard, fair health, and honesty;
    With threefold love I wish you all these three.

DUMAIN
-1
O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?

KATHARINE
-1
No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
    I'll mark no words that smooth-fac'd wooers say.
    Come when the King doth to my lady come;
    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.

DUMAIN
-1
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

KATHARINE
-1
Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.

LONGAVILLE
-1
What says Maria?

MARIA
-1
At the twelvemonth's end
    I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

LONGAVILLE
-1
I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

MARIA
-1
The liker you; few taller are so young.

BEROWNE
-1
Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me;
    Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
    What humble suit attends thy answer there.
    Impose some service on me for thy love.

ROSALINE
-1
Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
    Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
    Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
    Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
    Which you on all estates will execute
    That lie within the mercy of your wit.
    To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
    And therewithal to win me, if you please,
    Without the which I am not to be won,
    You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
    Visit the speechless sick, and still converse
    With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
    With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,
    To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

BEROWNE
-1
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
    It cannot be; it is impossible;
    Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

ROSALINE
-1
Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
    Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
    Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools.
    A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
    Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
    Of him that makes it; then, if sickly ears,
    Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
    Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
    And I will have you and that fault withal.
    But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
    And I shall find you empty of that fault,
    Right joyful of your reformation.

BEROWNE
-1
A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,
    I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
[ To the King] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take
    my leave.

KING
-1
No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

BEROWNE
-1
Our wooing doth not end like an old play:
    Jack hath not Jill. These ladies' courtesy
    Might well have made our sport a comedy.

KING
-1
Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth an' a day,
    And then 'twill end.

BEROWNE
-1
That's too long for a play.
                          Enter ARMADO

ARMADO
-1
Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-

PRINCESS OF FRANCE
-1
Was not that not Hector?

DUMAIN
-1
The worthy knight of Troy.

ARMADO
-1
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a
    votary: I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her
    sweet love three year. But, most esteemed greatness, will you
    hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in
    praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo? It should have followed in the
    end of our show.

KING
-1
Call them forth quickly; we will do so.

ARMADO
-1
Holla! approach.
                            Enter All
    This side is Hiems, Winter; this Ver, the Spring- the one
    maintained by the Owl, th' other by the Cuckoo. Ver, begin.
                      SPRING
         When daisies pied and violets blue
         And lady-smocks all silver-white
         And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
         Do paint the meadows with delight,
         The cuckoo then on every tree
         Mocks married men, for thus sings he:
              'Cuckoo;
         Cuckoo, cuckoo'- O word of fear,
         Unpleasing to a married ear!
         When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
         And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks;
         When turtles tread, and rooks and daws,
         And maidens bleach their summer smocks;
         The cuckoo then on every tree
         Mocks married men, for thus sings he:
              'Cuckoo;
         Cuckoo, cuckoo'- O word of fear,
         Unpleasing to a married ear!
                    WINTER
         When icicles hang by the wall,
         And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
         And Tom bears logs into the hall,
         And milk comes frozen home in pail,
         When blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul,
         Then nightly sings the staring owl:
              'Tu-who;
         Tu-whit, Tu-who'- A merry note,
         While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
         When all aloud the wind doth blow,
         And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
         And birds sit brooding in the snow,
         And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
         When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
         Then nightly sings the staring owl:
              'Tu-who;
         Tu-whit, To-who'- A merry note,
         While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
