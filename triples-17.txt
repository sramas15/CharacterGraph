  LONGAVILLE. 
1
King
NGAVILLE. I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.
  DUMAIN. 
1
King
MAIN. My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. I can but say their protestation over;
  KING. 
1
King
NG. Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
King
NGAVILLE. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
  KING. 
1
King
NG. Why, that to know which else we should not know.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  KING. 
1
King
NG. Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
  KING. 
1
King
NG. These be the stops that hinder study quite,
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
  KING. 
1
King
NG. How well he's read, to reason against reading!
  DUMAIN. 
1
King
MAIN. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
King
NGAVILLE. He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.
  DUMAIN. 
1
King
MAIN. How follows that?
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Fit in his place and time.
  DUMAIN. 
1
King
MAIN. In reason nothing.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Something then in rhyme.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
King
NGAVILLE. Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
  KING. 
1
King
NG. Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;

1
King
NGAVILLE. Marry, that did I.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Sweet lord, and why?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
King
NGAVILLE. To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility.
  KING. 
1
King
NG. What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. So study evermore is over-shot.
  KING. 
1
King
NG. We must of force dispense with this decree;
  BEROWNE. 
1
King
ROWNE. Necessity will make us all forsworn
  KING. 
1
King
NG. Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted

  BEROWNE.

King

2
King

  BEROWNE. 
2
King
DULL
ROWNE. How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
  LONGAVILLE. 
2
King
DULL
NGAVILLE. A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!
  BEROWNE. 
2
King
DULL
ROWNE. To hear, or forbear hearing?
  LONGAVILLE. 
2
King
DULL
NGAVILLE. To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to
  BEROWNE. 
2
King
DULL
ROWNE. Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
  COSTARD. 
2

  BEROWNE. 
2
King
DULL
ROWNE. As we would hear an oracle.

  COSTARD. 
2
King
DULL
STARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.
  KING. 
2
King
DULL
NG. It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.
  COSTARD.

King

MADO. Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. No, no; O Lord, sir, no!
  ARMADO.

MADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
  ARMADO.

TH. And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old

ARMADO
TH. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
  ARMADO.

ARMADO
MADO. I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete

TH. Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace

1
ARMADO
MADO. It doth amount to one more than two.

TH. It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such

TH. My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in

1
HOLOFERNES

ROWNE. The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself.
    They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!

      'So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
      To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
      As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
      The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;
      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper-
    Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

  PRINCESS 
1
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax;
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
  PRINCESS 
1
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. I would you knew.
  PRINCESS 
1
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. Anything like?
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS

  PRINCESS 
1
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
  ROSALINE.

  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
  PRINCESS

  MARIA. 
1
PRINCESS

  PRINCESS 
1
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  PRINCESS 
1
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  MARIA. 
1
PRINCESS
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  MARIA. 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

BOYET
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS

  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,

BEROWNE
KING
ROWNE. The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself.
    They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!

      'So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
      To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
      As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
      The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;
      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper-
    Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

PRINCESS
THARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.
  KATHARINE. 
1

  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
1

  KATHARINE. 
1
PRINCESS
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
1
PRINCESS

  MARIA. 
2
BOYET

  PRINCESS 
2
BOYET
PRINCESS
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.

  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.
  KING. 
1
DULL

MADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton

  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Which the base vulgar do call three.

  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love

TH. It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.

1
ARMADO
TH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such

  ARMADO.

BOYET
KING
ARMADO
MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH.

4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH

    Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the
    Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.
    'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give
    you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
    a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in

    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a

      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'

  KING.

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET

1
BOYET
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET

  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE.

  KING. 
1
BOYET

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET

  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING.

SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET

  KING.

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.

1
BOYET

  KING.

  ROSALINE.

BOYET
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE.

BOYET
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.

  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE.

BOYET
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.

  PRINCESS

BOYET
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Your reason?
  BOYET.

BOYET

BOYET
KING

MADO. How meanest thou? Brawling in French?
  MOTH.

BOYET
KING

TH. No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
  ARMADO. 
3
BOYET
KING
ARMADO
MADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING

BOYET
KING

BOYET
KING

MADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING

  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING

TH. As swift as lead, sir.
  ARMADO. 
3
BOYET
KING
ARMADO
MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING
ARMADO
TH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
  ARMADO. 
3
BOYET
KING
ARMADO
MADO. I say lead is slow.
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING
ARMADO
TH. You are too swift, sir, to say so:

BOYET
KING
ARMADO
MADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!

BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
  ARMADO.

BOYET
KING

ARMADO
MADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
  MOTH.

TH. A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
  COSTARD. 
4

4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
MADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
  MOTH. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
  ARMADO. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
MADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
  MOTH. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. I will tell you sensibly.
  COSTARD. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
STARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that

BOYET
KING
MOTH

MADO. We will talk no more of this matter.

    Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the
    Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.
    'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give
    you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
    a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of
    this word.

  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES

HOLOFERNES

  HOLOFERNES.

HOLOFERNES

  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. What is Dictynna?
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in
  DULL.

HOLOFERNES
LL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is

HOLOFERNES

  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please

ROWNE. The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself.
    They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!

LONGAVILLE
KING
NG. [Reads]
      'So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
      To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
      As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
      The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;
      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper-
    Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE.

THARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover,

  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.

BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET

  PRINCESS

BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
  BOYET.

BOYET
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,

YET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches

BOYET
YET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles,

1
BOYET
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.

  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE.

BOYET
SALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. But your legs should do it.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Your absence only.
  KING.

  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.

  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE.

MAIN. My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I can but say their protestation over;
  KING. 
0
NG. Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
  KING. 
0
NG. Why, that to know which else we should not know.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  KING. 
0
NG. Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
  KING. 
0
NG. These be the stops that hinder study quite,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
  KING. 
0
NG. How well he's read, to reason against reading!
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. How follows that?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Fit in his place and time.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. In reason nothing.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Something then in rhyme.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
  KING. 
0
NG. Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;

ROWNE. Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Marry, that did I.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Sweet lord, and why?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility.
  KING. 
0
NG. What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. So study evermore is over-shot.
  KING. 
0
NG. We must of force dispense with this decree;
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Necessity will make us all forsworn
  KING. 
0
NG. Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Armado is a most illustrious wight,

DULL
LL. Which is the Duke's own person?
  BEROWNE. 
1
DULL
ROWNE. This, fellow. What wouldst?
  DULL. 
1
DULL
LL. I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's
  BEROWNE.

STARD. Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
  KING. 
1
DULL
NG. A letter from the magnificent Armado.
  BEROWNE. 
1
DULL
ROWNE. How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
DULL
NGAVILLE. A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!
  BEROWNE. 
1
DULL
ROWNE. To hear, or forbear hearing?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
DULL
NGAVILLE. To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to
  BEROWNE. 
1
DULL
ROWNE. Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
  BEROWNE. 
1
DULL
ROWNE. In what manner?
  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was

DULL
ROWNE. For the following, sir?
  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the
  KING. 
1
DULL
NG. Will you hear this letter with attention?
  BEROWNE. 
1
DULL
ROWNE. As we would hear an oracle.
  COSTARD.

1
DULL
STARD. Sir, I confess the wench.
  KING. 
1
DULL
NG. Did you hear the proclamation?
  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
  KING. 
1
DULL
NG. It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a

1
DULL
STARD. I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.
  KING. 
1
DULL
NG. Well, it was proclaimed damsel.
  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.
  KING. 
1
DULL
NG. It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.
  COSTARD. 
1
DULL
STARD. If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.

STARD. This maid will serve my turn, sir.

DULL
NG. And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
    My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o'er;
    And go we, lords, to put in practice that

  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. No, no; O Lord, sir, no!
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender

ARMADO
MADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. Pretty and apt.
  MOTH.

TH. How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and

ARMADO
MADO. Thou pretty, because little.
  MOTH.

TH. Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. I have promised to study three years with the Duke.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. You may do it in an hour, sir.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. Impossible.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. How many is one thrice told?
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Which the base vulgar do call three.

ARMADO
MADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.
  MOTH.

1
ARMADO
MADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love

ARMADO
TH. It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such

MADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.

ARMADO
TH. My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!

1
ARMADO
MADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

DULL
ARMADO
STARD. Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is

  LONGAVILLE. 
2
BOYET

  PRINCESS

BOYET

BOYET
KING

TH. No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
  ARMADO. 
3
BOYET
KING

MADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET

BOYET

MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH.

BOYET
KING

TH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.

ARMADO
TH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
  ARMADO.

BOYET
KING

ARMADO
MADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
  MOTH.

BOYET

TH. A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
  COSTARD.

BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
MADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
  MOTH. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
  ARMADO.

ARMADO
MADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
  MOTH. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. I will tell you sensibly.

BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
STARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that

    Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the
    Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.
    'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give
    you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
    a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of
    this word.

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Twice-sod simplicity, bis coctus!

1
HOLOFERNES

  HOLOFERNES.

HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. What is Dictynna?
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please
  HOLOFERNES.

BEROWNE
KING
ROWNE. The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself.
    They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!

      'So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
      To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
      As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
      The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;
      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper-
    Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

INCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Madam, came nothing else along with that?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax;
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. I would you knew.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Anything like?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Madam, this glove.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover,
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  MARIA. 
1
BOYET
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET

  PRINCESS

BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thy news, Boyet?

  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. Under the cool shade of a sycamore
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
  BOYET.

BOYET
YET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.

  BOYET.

BOYET
YET. What would you with the Princess?
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. What would they, say they?
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. She says you have it, and you may be gone.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Say to her we have measur'd many miles
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET. 
1
BOYET
YET. She hears herself.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. How many weary steps
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. But your legs should do it.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Your absence only.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. That can never be.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. In private then.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Seventh sweet, adieu!
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. One word in secret.
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Let it not be sweet.
  BEROWNE. 
1
BOYET
ROWNE. Thou grievest my gall.
  PRINCESS

BOYET
THARINE. What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. Let's part the word.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. No, I'll not be your half.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.
  BOYET.

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. They were all in lamentable cases!
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
  MARIA. 
1
BOYET
RIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Qualm, perhaps.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. Yes, in good faith.
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Go, sickness as thou art!
  ROSALINE.

BOYET
SALINE. Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. And Longaville was for my service born.

BOYET
YET. Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:

BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Will they return?

BOYET
SALINE. Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,

  KING. 
2
BOYET
KING
NG. All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
  PRINCESS 
2
BOYET
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
  KING. 
2
BOYET
KING
NG. Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  PRINCESS

BOYET
KING

2
BOYET
KING
ROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
  ROSALINE. 
2
BOYET
KING
SALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
  BEROWNE. 
2
BOYET
KING
ROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.
  ROSALINE.

BOYET
KING

KING
NG. I was, fair madam.
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. When she shall challenge this, you will reject

  PRINCESS

BOYET
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. With what?
  BOYET. 
2
BOYET
KING
YET. With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'
  PRINCESS 
2
BOYET
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Your reason?
  BOYET. 
2
BOYET
KING
YET. Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
  PRINCESS 
2
BOYET
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.
  BOYET.

3
BOYET
KING

  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING

TH. No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
  ARMADO. 
3
BOYET
KING

MADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING

BOYET

  ARMADO. 
3
BOYET
KING

MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH. 
3
BOYET
KING

TH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
  ARMADO.

BOYET
KING
ARMADO
MADO. I say lead is slow.
  MOTH.

BOYET
KING
ARMADO
TH. You are too swift, sir, to say so:

TH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
  ARMADO.

ARMADO
MADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
  MOTH.

BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
MADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
  MOTH. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
4
BOYET
KING
MOTH
ARMADO
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
  ARMADO.

    Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the
    Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings- remuneration.
    'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give
    you a remuneration.' Why, it carries it. Remuneration! Why, it is
    a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of
    this word.

    They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!

      As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
      The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;
      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'

  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE.

RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET

  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
1
BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,

BOYET
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
  BOYET.

BOYET
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET.

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING.

BOYET
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING.

1
BOYET
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.

  LONGAVILLE.

BOYET
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,

BOYET
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE.

BOYET
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.

TH. It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
  ARMADO. 
1
ARMADO
MADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.
  MOTH. 
1
ARMADO
TH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such

MADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.

ARMADO
TH. My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!

    'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One penny.'- 'No, I'll give

    They have pitch'd a toil: I am tolling in a pitch- pitch that
    defiles. Defile! a foul word. Well, 'set thee down, sorrow!' for
    so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I am the fool. Well
    proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kills
    sheep; it kills me- I a sheep. Well proved again o' my side. I
    will not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes,
    for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and
    lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to
    rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
    here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets already; the
    clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet
    clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not
    care a pin if the other three were in. Here comes one with a
    paper; God give him grace to groan!

      'So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
      To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
      As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
      The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;
      Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
      As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.
      Thou shin'st in every tear that I do weep;
      No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
      So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
      Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
      And they thy glory through my grief will show.
      But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
      My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
      O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel
      No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell.'
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper-

SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.

  BEROWNE.

  KING.

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
1
BOYET

  ROSALINE.

BOYET
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
1
BOYET
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING.

  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET

  KING.

  KATHARINE.

BOYET
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
1
BOYET
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.

  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE.

THARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
BOYET
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.
  KATHARINE.

  ROSALINE.

  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  ROSALINE. 
1
BOYET
SALINE. They were all in lamentable cases!
  PRINCESS

BOYET
INCESS OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
  MARIA.

  ARMADO.

MADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.
  JAQUENETTA.

QUENETTA. That's hereby.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I know where it is situate.
  JAQUENETTA. 
0
QUENETTA. Lord, how wise you are!
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I will tell thee wonders.
  JAQUENETTA.

QUENETTA. With that face?
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I love thee.
  JAQUENETTA.

QUENETTA. So I heard you say.
  ARMADO.

MADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Come, you transgressing slave, away.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. No, sir; that were fast, and loose. Thou shalt to prison.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I

TH. What shall some see?

  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Proud of employment, willingly I go.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. Lord Longaville is one.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Know you the man?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. I know him, madam; at a marriage feast,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. They say so most that most his humours know.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Such short-liv'd wits do wither as they grow.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. The young Dumain, a well-accomplish'd youth,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Another of these students at that time
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. God bless my ladies! Are they all in love,
  FIRST 
0
RST LORD. Here comes Boyet.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Now, what admittance, lord?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
  KING. 
0
NG. Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. 'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I
  KING. 
0
NG. You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I will be welcome then; conduct me thither.
  KING. 
0
NG. Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath-
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.
  KING. 
0
NG. Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Why, will shall break it; will, and nothing
  KING. 
0
NG. Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
  KING. 
0
NG. Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. YOU Will the sooner that I were away,
  BEROWNE.

ROWNE. Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I know you did.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. How needless was it then to ask the question!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. You must not be so quick.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. 'Tis long of you, that spur me with such questions.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. What time o' day?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. The hour that fools should ask.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Now fair befall your mask!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Fair fall the face it covers!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. And send you many lovers!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Amen, so you be none.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nay, then will I be gone.
  KING. 
0
NG. Madam, your father here doth intimate
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. You do the King my father too much wrong,
  KING. 
0
NG. I do protest I never heard of it;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We arrest your word.
  KING. 
0
NG. Satisfy me so.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. So please your Grace, the packet is not come,
  KING.

NG. It shall suffice me; at which interview
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet health and fair desires consort your

  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Pray you, do my commendations;
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I would you heard it groan.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Is the fool sick?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Sick at the heart.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Alack, let it blood.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Would that do it good?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. My physic says 'ay.'
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Will YOU prick't with your eye?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. No point, with my knife.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Now, God save thy life!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. And yours from long living!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I cannot stay thanksgiving.                [Retiring]
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.          Exit
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Her mother's, I have heard.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. God's blessing on your beard!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Good sir, be not offended;
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Nay, my choler is ended.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Not unlike, sir; that may be.           Exit LONGAVILLE
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. What's her name in the cap?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Rosaline, by good hap.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Is she wedded or no?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. To her will, sir, or so.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. You are welcome, sir; adieu!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;
  BOYET. 
0
YET. And every jest but a word.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. It was well done of you to take him at his
  BOYET. 
0
YET. I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Two hot sheeps, marry!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. And wherefore not ships?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You sheep and I pasture- shall that finish the jest?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. So you grant pasture for me.     [Offering to kiss her]
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Not so, gentle beast;
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Belonging to whom?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. To my fortunes and me.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. If my observation, which very seldom lies,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. With what?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Your reason?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd;
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Do you hear, my mad wenches?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. No.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. What, then; do you see?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, our way to be gone.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. You are too hard for me.                         Exeunt
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. How meanest thou? Brawling in French?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. By my penny of observation.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. But O- but O-
  MOTH. 
0
TH. The hobby-horse is forgot.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Almost I had.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Negligent student! learn her by heart.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. By heart and in heart, boy.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. What wilt thou prove?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I am all these three.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. The way is but short; away.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. As swift as lead, sir.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I say lead is slow.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. You are too swift, sir, to say so:
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Thump, then, and I flee.                            Exit
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
  MOTH. 
0
TH. A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
  MOTH. 
0
TH. I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO.  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
  MOTH. 
0
TH.    Until the goose came out of door,
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO.  Until the goose came out of door,
  MOTH. 
0
TH. A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. I will tell you sensibly.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Till there be more matter in the shin.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. My sweet ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met!
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. What is a remuneration?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I thank your worship. God be wi' you!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Stay, slave; I must employ thee.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. When would you have it done, sir?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. This afternoon.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Well, I will do it, sir; fare you well.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Thou knowest not what it is.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Why, villain, thou must know first.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. It must be done this afternoon.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration; a
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. And I, forsooth, in love; I, that have been love's whip;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Was that the King that spurr'd his horse so
  BOYET. 
0
YET. I know not; but I think it was not he.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Whoe'er 'a was, 'a show'd a mounting mind.
  FORESTER. 
0
RESTER. Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot,
  FORESTER. 
0
RESTER. Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. What, what? First praise me, and again say no?
  FORESTER. 
0
RESTER. Yes, madam, fair.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nay, never paint me now;
  FORESTER. 
0
RESTER. Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. See, see, my beauty will be sav'd by merit.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Only for praise; and praise we may afford
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The thickest and the tallest.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. The thickest and the tallest! It is so; truth is truth.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. What's your will, sir? What's your will?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. O, thy letter, thy letter! He's a good friend
  BOYET. 
0
YET. I am bound to serve.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We will read it, I swear.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. [Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. What plume of feathers is he that indited this
  BOYET. 
0
YET. I am much deceived but I remember the style.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Else your memory is bad, going o'er it
  BOYET. 
0
YET. This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thou fellow, a word.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I told you: my lord.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. To whom shouldst thou give it?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. From my lord to my lady.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. From which lord to which lady?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. From my Lord Berowne, a good master of mine,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Who is the shooter? who is the shooter?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Shall I teach you to know?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Ay, my continent of beauty.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Why, she that bears the bow.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well then, I am the shooter.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. And who is your deer?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. You Still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the
  BOYET. 
0
YET. But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man
  BOYET. 
0
YET. So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. [Singing]
  BOYET. 
0
YET.    An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. By my troth, most pleasant! How both did fit it!
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. A mark marvellous well shot; for they both did hit it.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Wide o' the bow-hand! I' faith, your hand is out.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Indeed, 'a must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the
  BOYET. 
0
YET. An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. She's too hard for you at pricks, sir; challenge her to
  BOYET. 
0
YET. I fear too much rubbing; good-night, my good owl.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown!
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Very reverent sport, truly; and done in the testimony of
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
  DULL. 
0
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,
  DULL. 
0
LL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Twice-sod simplicity, bis coctus!
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in
  DULL. 
0
LL. You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
  DULL. 
0
LL. What is Dictynna?
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
  DULL. 
0
LL. 'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in
  DULL. 
0
LL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. I Will something affect the letter, for it argues
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. A rare talent!
  DULL. 
0
LL. [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Mehercle, if their sons be ingenious, they shall want
  JAQUENETTA. 
0
QUENETTA. God give you good morrow, Master Person.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Master Person, quasi pers-one. And if one should be
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Marry, Master Schoolmaster, he that is likest to a
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Piercing a hogshead! A good lustre of conceit in a turf
  JAQUENETTA. 
0
QUENETTA. Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter;
  HOLOFERNES.

ROWNE. One drunkard loves another of the name.
  LONGAVILLE.

NGAVILLE. Am I the first that have been perjur'd so?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I could put thee in comfort: not by two that I know;

0
ROWNE. Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
  KING. 
0
NG. O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. And since her time are colliers counted bright.
  KING. 
0
NG. And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
  DUMAIN.

MAIN. O vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies
  KING. 
0
NG. But what of this? Are we not all in love?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

0
MAIN. Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

THANIEL. Laus Deo, bone intelligo.

LOFERNES. Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Quis, quis, thou consonant?

LOFERNES. I will repeat them: a, e, I-
  MOTH.

TH. The sheep; the other two concludes it: o, U.

LOFERNES. Thou disputes like an infant; go whip thy gig.
  MOTH.

0
STARD. An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it
  HOLOFERNES.

LOFERNES. O, I smell false Latin; 'dunghill' for unguem.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Arts-man, preambulate; we will be singuled from the

LOFERNES. I do, sans question.
  ARMADO.

MADO. Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to

LOFERNES. Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
  NATHANIEL.

THANIEL. Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for that
  HOLOFERNES.

LOFERNES. Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in

INCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,

0
SALINE. Madam, came nothing else along with that?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax;
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. I would you knew.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Anything like?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Madam, this glove.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover,
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her Grace?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thy news, Boyet?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Prepare, madam, prepare!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Under the cool shade of a sycamore
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
  MOTH.

TH. A holy parcel of the fairest dames
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. True; out indeed.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Once to behold, rogue.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will not answer to that epithet;
  MOTH. 
0
TH. They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. What would you with the Princess?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would they, say they?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She says you have it, and you may be gone.
  KING. 
0
NG. Say to her we have measur'd many miles
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
  BOYET. 
0
YET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She hears herself.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. How many weary steps
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
  KING. 
0
NG. Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
  KING. 
0
NG. Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
  KING. 
0
NG. Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
  KING. 
0
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
0
NG. But your legs should do it.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
0
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
0
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING. 
0
NG. Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Your absence only.
  KING. 
0
NG. That can never be.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
  KING. 
0
NG. If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. In private then.
  KING. 
0
NG. I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Seventh sweet, adieu!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. One word in secret.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Let it not be sweet.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Thou grievest my gall.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Gall! bitter.
  BEROWNE.

RIA. Say you so? Fair lord-
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Please it you,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Let's part the word.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, I'll not be your half.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  KING.

YET. Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They were all in lamentable cases!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Qualm, perhaps.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, in good faith.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Go, sickness as thou art!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. And Longaville was for my service born.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Will they return?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will, they will, God knows,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
  KING. 
0
NG. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
  KING. 
0
NG. That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.          Exit
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
  KING. 
0
NG. A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
  KING. 
0
NG. All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
  KING. 
0
NG. Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  KING. 
0
NG. We came to visit you, and purpose now
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
  KING. 
0
NG. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. You nickname virtue: vice you should have
  KING. 
0
NG. O, you have liv'd in desolation here,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
  KING. 
0
NG. How, madam! Russians!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Ay, in truth, my lord;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. But that you take what doth to you belong,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. O, I am yours, and all that I possess.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. All the fool mine?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I cannot give you less.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
  KING. 
0
NG. We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Yet I have a trick
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. It is not so; for how can this be true,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Peace; for I will not have to do with you.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
  KING. 
0
NG. Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The fairest is confession.
  KING. 
0
NG. Madam, I was.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And were you well advis'd?
  KING. 
0
NG. I was, fair madam.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. When you then were here,
  KING. 
0
NG. That more than all the world I did respect her.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. When she shall challenge this, you will reject
  KING. 
0
NG. Upon mine honour, no.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Peace, peace, forbear;
  KING. 
0
NG. Despise me when I break this oath of mine.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. God give thee joy of him! The noble lord
  KING. 
0
NG. What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,
  KING. 
0
NG. My faith and this the Princess I did give;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Full merrily
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace; I have done.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. O Lord, sir, they would know
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. What, are there but three?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. No, sir; but it is vara fine,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. And three times thrice is nine.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Not so, sir; under correction, sir,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Is not nine.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. How much is it?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Art thou one of the Worthies?
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great;
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Go, bid them prepare.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.
  KING. 
0
NG. Berowne, they will shame us; let them not approach.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy
  KING. 
0
NG. I say they shall not come.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. A right description of our sport, my lord.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Doth this man serve God?
  BEROWNE.

ROWNE. Why ask you?
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. 'A speaks not like a man of God his making.

  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. There is five in the first show.
  KING.

NG. You are deceived, 'tis not so.
  BEROWNE.

ROWNE. The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and
  KING. 
0
NG. The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I Pompey am-
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. You lie, you are not he.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I Pompey am-
  BOYET. 
0
YET. With libbard's head on knee.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. I Pompey am, Pompey surnam'd the Big-
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. It is Great, sir.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Great thanks, great Pompey.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. 'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander;
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander-

YET. Most true, 'tis right, you were so, Alisander.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Pompey the Great!
  COSTARD.

  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. [To Sir Nathaniel] O, Sir, you have overthrown Alisander
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Stand aside, good Pompey.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. A Judas!
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Not Iscariot, sir.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. A kissing traitor. How art thou prov'd Judas?
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Judas I am-
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. The more shame for you, Judas!
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. What mean you, sir?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. To make Judas hang himself.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Begin, sir; you are my elder.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. I will not be put out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Because thou hast no face.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. What is this?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. A cittern-head.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. The head of a bodkin.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. A death's face in a ring.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The pommel of Coesar's falchion.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. The carv'd-bone face on a flask.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now,
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. You have put me out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. False: we have given thee faces.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. But you have outfac'd them all.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. An thou wert a lion we would do so.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. For the latter end of his name.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. For the ass to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark, he may stumble.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
  KING. 
0
NG. Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. But is this Hector?
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. His leg is too big for Hector's.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. More calf, certain.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. No; he is best indued in the small.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. This cannot be Hector.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. A gilt nutmeg.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. A lemon.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Stuck with cloves.

  LONGAVILLE.

NGAVILLE. That columbine.
  ARMADO.

MADO. Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.

MADO. The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, beat

  DUMAIN.

  MOTH.

TH. Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. What reason have you for 't?
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
  BOYET.

YET. True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;
  MARCADE.

RCADE. God save you, madam!

  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Dead, for my life!
  MARCADE. 
0
RCADE. Even so; my tale is told.
  BEROWNE.

  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
  KING. 
0
NG. The extreme parts of time extremely forms
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I understand you not; my griefs are double.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. So did our looks.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We did not quote them so.
  KING. 
0
NG. Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. A time, methinks, too short
  KING. 
0
NG. If this, or more than this, I would deny,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. And what to me, my love? and what to me?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. But what to me, my love? but what to me?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A beard, fair health, and honesty;
  DUMAIN.

MAIN. O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. What says Maria?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. At the twelvemonth's end
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. The liker you; few taller are so young.
  BEROWNE.

ROWNE. Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
  BEROWNE.

ROWNE. To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,

INCESS OF FRANCE. [ To the King] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take
  KING. 
0
NG. No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

ROWNE. That's too long for a play.
  ARMADO.

  DUMAIN.

  DUMAIN.

  BEROWNE. 
0

  KING.

NG. Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
  LONGAVILLE.

NGAVILLE. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
  KING. 
0
NG. Why, that to know which else we should not know.
  BEROWNE.

  DUMAIN.

MAIN. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
  LONGAVILLE.

NGAVILLE. He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
  BEROWNE.

  DUMAIN.

TH. A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. I am all these three.
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. The way is but short; away.
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. As swift as lead, sir.
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. I say lead is slow.
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. You are too swift, sir, to say so:
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. Thump, then, and I flee.                            Exit
  ARMADO.

BOYET
MADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
  ARMADO.

BOYET
MOTH
MADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
    By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face;
    Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
    My herald is return'd.
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO.  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,

2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO.  Until the goose came out of door,
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. I will tell you sensibly.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. Till there be more matter in the shin.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
  MOTH.

BOYET
ROWNE. What is a remuneration?
  COSTARD.

HOLOFERNES

HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as
  NATHANIEL. 
1

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES.

HOLOFERNES

  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES

  HOLOFERNES.

HOLOFERNES

  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. What is Dictynna?
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. I Will something affect the letter, for it argues

0
LOFERNES. Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his

0
THANIEL. A most singular and choice epithet.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Laus Deo, bone intelligo.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. 'Bone'?- 'bone' for 'bene.' Priscian a little
  NATHANIEL.

THANIEL. Videsne quis venit?
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Video, et gaudeo.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. [To MOTH] Chirrah!
  HOLOFERNES.

LOFERNES. Quare 'chirrah,' not 'sirrah'?
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Men of peace, well encount'red.

LOFERNES. Most military sir, salutation.

TH. Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a, b, spelt
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Quis, quis, thou consonant?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. The third of the five vowels, if You repeat them; or the
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. I will repeat them: a, e, I-
  MOTH. 
0
TH. The sheep; the other two concludes it: o, U.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch,

TH. Offer'd by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. What is the figure? What is the figure?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Horns.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Thou disputes like an infant; go whip thy gig.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. O, I smell false Latin; 'dunghill' for unguem.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Arts-man, preambulate; we will be singuled from the
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Or mons, the hill.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. I do, sans question.
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to

LOFERNES. Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
  NATHANIEL. 
0
THANIEL. Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for that
  HOLOFERNES. 
0
LOFERNES. Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in

TH. An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may

  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Madam, came nothing else along with that?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax;
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. I would you knew.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Anything like?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Madam, this glove.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover,
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her Grace?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thy news, Boyet?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Prepare, madam, prepare!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Under the cool shade of a sycamore
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. A holy parcel of the fairest dames
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. True; out indeed.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Once to behold, rogue.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will not answer to that epithet;
  MOTH. 
0
TH. They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. What would you with the Princess?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would they, say they?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She says you have it, and you may be gone.
  KING. 
0
NG. Say to her we have measur'd many miles
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
  BOYET. 
0
YET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She hears herself.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. How many weary steps
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
  KING. 
0
NG. Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
  KING. 
0
NG. Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
  KING. 
0
NG. Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
  KING. 
0
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
0
NG. But your legs should do it.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
0
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
0
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING. 
0
NG. Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Your absence only.
  KING. 
0
NG. That can never be.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
  KING. 
0
NG. If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. In private then.
  KING. 
0
NG. I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Seventh sweet, adieu!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. One word in secret.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Let it not be sweet.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Thou grievest my gall.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Gall! bitter.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Therefore meet.                 [They converse apart]
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Name it.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Fair lady-
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Say you so? Fair lord-
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Please it you,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Let's part the word.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, I'll not be your half.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  KING. 
0
NG. Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They were all in lamentable cases!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Qualm, perhaps.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, in good faith.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Go, sickness as thou art!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. And Longaville was for my service born.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Will they return?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will, they will, God knows,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
  PRINCESS

KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.          Exit
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
    That put Armado's page out of his part!
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. We came to visit you, and purpose now
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. You nickname virtue: vice you should have
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. O, you have liv'd in desolation here,
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. How, madam! Russians!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Ay, in truth, my lord;
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. But that you take what doth to you belong,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. O, I am yours, and all that I possess.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. All the fool mine?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. I cannot give you less.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Yet I have a trick
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. It is not so; for how can this be true,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Peace; for I will not have to do with you.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. The fairest is confession.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Madam, I was.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. And were you well advis'd?
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. I was, fair madam.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. When you then were here,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. That more than all the world I did respect her.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. When she shall challenge this, you will reject
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Upon mine honour, no.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Peace, peace, forbear;
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Despise me when I break this oath of mine.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. God give thee joy of him! The noble lord
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. My faith and this the Princess I did give;
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. Full merrily
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace; I have done.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. O Lord, sir, they would know
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. What, are there but three?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. No, sir; but it is vara fine,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. And three times thrice is nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Not so, sir; under correction, sir,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Is not nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. How much is it?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Art thou one of the Worthies?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great;
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Go, bid them prepare.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

1
KING
MAIN. The more shame for you, Judas!
  HOLOFERNES.

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. Begin, sir; you are my elder.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. I will not be put out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
1

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. You have put me out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. False: we have given thee faces.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. But you have outfac'd them all.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING

  BOYET.

KING
YET. Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING

  BEROWNE. 
1
KING

  BOYET. 
1
KING

ROWNE. Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. But is this Hector?
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. His leg is too big for Hector's.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. More calf, certain.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. No; he is best indued in the small.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This cannot be Hector.

1
KING
MAIN. Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
  ARMADO.

1
KING
MADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Then shall Hector be whipt for Jaquenetta that is quick by
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Most rare Pompey!
  BOYET.

1
KING
MADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.

1
KING
MAIN. Room for the incensed Worthies!
  COSTARD.

KING
MAIN. Most resolute Pompey!
  MOTH. 
1
KING
TH. Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my

1
KING
MAIN. You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. What reason have you for 't?
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;
  MARCADE. 
1
KING
RCADE. God save you, madam!

INCESS OF FRANCE. Welcome, Marcade;

  PRINCESS

KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Dead, for my life!
  MARCADE.

KING
RCADE. Even so; my tale is told.
  BEROWNE.

1
KING
MADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
    day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will

1

  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. I understand you not; my griefs are double.

  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. So did our looks.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. We did not quote them so.

1
KING
NG. Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. A time, methinks, too short
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. If this, or more than this, I would deny,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. And what to me, my love? and what to me?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;

1
KING
MAIN. But what to me, my love? but what to me?
  KATHARINE. 
1
KING
THARINE. A beard, fair health, and honesty;

1
KING

  KATHARINE. 
1
KING
THARINE. No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day

  BEROWNE.

KING

  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,

  KING.

  KING.

MADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?

2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;

  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. I will tell you sensibly.
  COSTARD.

BOYET
MOTH
STARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that

  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. What is Dictynna?
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please

THARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. I would you knew.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Anything like?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Madam, this glove.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover,
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her Grace?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Thy news, Boyet?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Prepare, madam, prepare!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Under the cool shade of a sycamore
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. A holy parcel of the fairest dames
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!
  BOYET. 
0
YET. True; out indeed.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Once to behold, rogue.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will not answer to that epithet;
  MOTH. 
0
TH. They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. What would you with the Princess?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would they, say they?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She says you have it, and you may be gone.
  KING. 
0
NG. Say to her we have measur'd many miles
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
  BOYET. 
0
YET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She hears herself.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. How many weary steps
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
  KING. 
0
NG. Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
  KING. 
0
NG. Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
  KING. 
0
NG. Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
  KING. 
0
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
0
NG. But your legs should do it.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
0
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
0
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING. 
0
NG. Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Your absence only.
  KING. 
0
NG. That can never be.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
  KING. 
0
NG. If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. In private then.
  KING. 
0
NG. I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Seventh sweet, adieu!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. One word in secret.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Let it not be sweet.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Thou grievest my gall.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Gall! bitter.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Therefore meet.                 [They converse apart]
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Name it.
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Fair lady-
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Say you so? Fair lord-
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Please it you,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Let's part the word.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, I'll not be your half.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  KING. 
0
NG. Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They were all in lamentable cases!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Qualm, perhaps.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, in good faith.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Go, sickness as thou art!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. And Longaville was for my service born.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Will they return?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will, they will, God knows,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.

KING
NG. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.          Exit
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,

1
KING
NG. A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,

1
KING
NG. A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
    That put Armado's page out of his part!
  BEROWNE.

KING
ROWNE. See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. We came to visit you, and purpose now
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. You nickname virtue: vice you should have
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. O, you have liv'd in desolation here,
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. How, madam! Russians!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Ay, in truth, my lord;
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. But that you take what doth to you belong,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. O, I am yours, and all that I possess.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. All the fool mine?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. I cannot give you less.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Yet I have a trick
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. It is not so; for how can this be true,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Peace; for I will not have to do with you.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. The fairest is confession.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Madam, I was.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. And were you well advis'd?
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. I was, fair madam.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. When you then were here,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. That more than all the world I did respect her.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. When she shall challenge this, you will reject
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Upon mine honour, no.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Peace, peace, forbear;
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Despise me when I break this oath of mine.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
  PRINCESS

  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,

KING
NG. My faith and this the Princess I did give;

KING
ROWNE. What, are there but three?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. No, sir; but it is vara fine,

KING
ROWNE. And three times thrice is nine.

1
KING
STARD. Not so, sir; under correction, sir,

1
KING
ROWNE. Is not nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by

1
KING
ROWNE. How much is it?

KING
STARD. We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

ROWNE. We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. I say they shall not come.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. A right description of our sport, my lord.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Doth this man serve God?

    guerra. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

ROWNE. Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now,
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. You have put me out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. False: we have given thee faces.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. But you have outfac'd them all.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. An thou wert a lion we would do so.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. For the latter end of his name.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. For the ass to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark, he may stumble.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. But is this Hector?
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. His leg is too big for Hector's.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. More calf, certain.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. No; he is best indued in the small.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This cannot be Hector.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. A gilt nutmeg.

1
KING
NGAVILLE. Stuck with cloves.
  DUMAIN.

  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Peace!
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. That mint.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. That columbine.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, beat
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Speak, brave Hector; we are much delighted.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. I do adore thy sweet Grace's slipper.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. [Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she is two
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. What meanest thou?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Then shall Hector be whipt for Jaquenetta that is quick by
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Most rare Pompey!
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. Renowned Pompey!
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Greater than Great! Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Hector trembles.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on! stir
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Hector will challenge him.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Ay, if 'a have no more man's blood in his belly than will
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. I will not fight with a pole, like a Northern man; I'll
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Room for the incensed Worthies!
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. I'll do it in my shirt.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Most resolute Pompey!
  MOTH. 
1
KING
TH. Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. What reason have you for 't?
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen;
  MARCADE. 
1
KING
RCADE. God save you, madam!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Welcome, Marcade;
  MARCADE. 
1
KING
RCADE. I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Dead, for my life!
  MARCADE. 
1
KING
RCADE. Even so; my tale is told.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. WOrthies away; the scene begins to cloud.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
    day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will

  KING. 
1
KING
NG. How fares your Majesty?
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Boyet, prepare; I will away to-night.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Madam, not so; I do beseech you stay.
  PRINCESS

KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. The extreme parts of time extremely forms
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. I understand you not; my griefs are double.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. We have receiv'd your letters, full of love;
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. So did our looks.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. We did not quote them so.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. A time, methinks, too short
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. If this, or more than this, I would deny,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. And what to me, my love? and what to me?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. But what to me, my love? but what to me?
  KATHARINE. 
1
KING
THARINE. A beard, fair health, and honesty;
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?
  KATHARINE. 
1
KING
THARINE. No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
  KATHARINE. 
1
KING
THARINE. Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. What says Maria?
  MARIA. 
1
KING
RIA. At the twelvemonth's end
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
  MARIA. 
1
KING
RIA. The liker you; few taller are so young.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me;
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,
  PRINCESS

KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. [ To the King] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
  BEROWNE.

KING
ROWNE. Our wooing doth not end like an old play:
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth an' a day,
  BEROWNE. 
2
KING
ARMADO
ROWNE. That's too long for a play.
  ARMADO.

  DUMAIN. 
0

  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. I can but say their protestation over;
  KING. 
0
NG. Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
  KING. 
0
NG. Why, that to know which else we should not know.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
  KING. 
0
NG. Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
  KING. 
0
NG. These be the stops that hinder study quite,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
  KING. 
0
NG. How well he's read, to reason against reading!
  DUMAIN. 
0
MAIN. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
  BEROWNE.

  DUMAIN.

  BEROWNE.

  DUMAIN.

  LONGAVILLE.

ROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility.
  KING. 
0
NG. What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
  BEROWNE.

  KING.

  COSTARD.

0
STARD. I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.
  KING. 
0
NG. Well, it was proclaimed damsel.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.
  KING. 
0
NG. It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.
  COSTARD. 
0
STARD. If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.

0
MADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
  ARMADO. 
0
MADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
  MOTH.

TH. And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old

MADO. I love not to be cross'd.
  MOTH.

  ARMADO.

TH. As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.

TH. No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's

1
BOYET
MADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. By my penny of observation.
  ARMADO.

BOYET
MADO. But O- but O-
  MOTH.

TH. The hobby-horse is forgot.
  ARMADO.

BOYET
MADO. Almost I had.

TH. Negligent student! learn her by heart.

TH. And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.
  ARMADO.

BOYET
MADO. What wilt thou prove?
  MOTH.

BOYET
TH. A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the

BOYET
MADO. I am all these three.
  MOTH.

BOYET
TH. And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an

BOYET
MADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is

BOYET
TH. As swift as lead, sir.
  ARMADO.

BOYET
MADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
  ARMADO. 
1
BOYET
MADO. I say lead is slow.
  MOTH. 
1
BOYET
TH. You are too swift, sir, to say so:

MADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!

BOYET
MOTH
MADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.

BOYET
MOTH
TH. A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?

2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
  MOTH. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
TH. I will tell you sensibly.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
  COSTARD. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
STARD. Till there be more matter in the shin.
  ARMADO. 
2
BOYET
MOTH
MADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
  COSTARD.

HOLOFERNES
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Very reverent sport, truly; and done in the testimony of
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Twice-sod simplicity, bis coctus!
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. What is Dictynna?
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. 'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. I Will something affect the letter, for it argues
  NATHANIEL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. A rare talent!
  DULL. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LL. [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish

QUENETTA. Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter;

HOLOFERNES
LOFERNES. Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
  NATHANIEL.

HOLOFERNES
THANIEL. Marvellous well for the pen.

0
SALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax;
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We need more light to find your meaning out.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
  PRINCESS

  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. I would you knew.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Anything like?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
  ROSALINE.

SALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Madam, this glove.
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain?
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover,

0
INCESS OF FRANCE. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
  PRINCESS

  BOYET.

INCESS OF FRANCE. Thy news, Boyet?
  BOYET.

  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Under the cool shade of a sycamore
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.
  MOTH.

TH. All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
  BOYET. 
0

  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
  MOTH.

  BOYET.

  MOTH. 
0
TH. Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Once to behold, rogue.
  MOTH. 
0
TH. Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will not answer to that epithet;
  MOTH. 
0
TH. They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. What would you with the Princess?
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. What would they, say they?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She says you have it, and you may be gone.
  KING. 
0
NG. Say to her we have measur'd many miles
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches
  BOYET. 
0
YET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. She hears herself.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. How many weary steps
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
  ROSALINE.

SALINE. My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
  KING. 
0
NG. Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
  KING. 
0
NG. Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
  KING. 
0
NG. Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
  KING. 
0
NG. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it.
  KING. 
0
NG. But your legs should do it.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
  KING. 
0
NG. Why take we hands then?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Only to part friends.
  KING. 
0
NG. More measure of this measure; be not nice.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. We can afford no more at such a price.
  KING. 
0
NG. Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Your absence only.
  KING. 
0
NG. That can never be.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
  KING. 
0
NG. If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. In private then.
  KING. 
0
NG. I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Seventh sweet, adieu!
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. One word in secret.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Let it not be sweet.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Thou grievest my gall.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Gall! bitter.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. Therefore meet.                 [They converse apart]
  DUMAIN.

MAIN. Please it you,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. You have a double tongue within your mask,
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. A calf, fair lady!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, a fair lord calf.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Let's part the word.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. No, I'll not be your half.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
  LONGAVILLE. 
0
NGAVILLE. One word in private with you ere I die.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
  BEROWNE. 
0
ROWNE. By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
  KING. 
0
NG. Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. They were all in lamentable cases!
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Qualm, perhaps.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. Yes, in good faith.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Go, sickness as thou art!
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
  KATHARINE. 
0
THARINE. And Longaville was for my service born.
  MARIA. 
0
RIA. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. Will they return?
  BOYET. 
0
YET. They will, they will, God knows,
  PRINCESS 
0
INCESS OF FRANCE. How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.
  BOYET. 
0
YET. Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:
  PRINCESS

INCESS OF FRANCE. Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
  ROSALINE. 
0
SALINE. Good madam, if by me you'll be advis'd,

  KING.

1
KING
NG. A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,

KING
ROWNE. See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Construe my speeches better, if you may.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. We came to visit you, and purpose now
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. You nickname virtue: vice you should have
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. O, you have liv'd in desolation here,
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. How, madam! Russians!
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Ay, in truth, my lord;
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. But that you take what doth to you belong,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. O, I am yours, and all that I possess.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. All the fool mine?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. I cannot give you less.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Yet I have a trick
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. It is not so; for how can this be true,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Peace; for I will not have to do with you.
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. The fairest is confession.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Madam, I was.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. And were you well advis'd?
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. I was, fair madam.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. When you then were here,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. That more than all the world I did respect her.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. When she shall challenge this, you will reject
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Upon mine honour, no.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Peace, peace, forbear;
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Despise me when I break this oath of mine.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
  PRINCESS

KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. God give thee joy of him! The noble lord

1
KING
NG. What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,
  ROSALINE. 
1
KING
SALINE. By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain,
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. My faith and this the Princess I did give;

KING
ROWNE. What, are there but three?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. No, sir; but it is vara fine,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. And three times thrice is nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Not so, sir; under correction, sir,
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Is not nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. How much is it?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will

KING
ROWNE. Art thou one of the Worthies?

KING
STARD. It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great;

1
KING
ROWNE. Go, bid them prepare.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. We are shame-proof, my lord, and 'tis some policy
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. I say they shall not come.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. A right description of our sport, my lord.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Doth this man serve God?
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Why ask you?

KING
MADO. That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I
    protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too too vain,
    too too vain; but we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la
    guerra. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

KING
ROWNE. There is five in the first show.

1
KING
NG. You are deceived, 'tis not so.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and

1
KING
NG. The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.

1
KING
STARD. I Pompey am-

  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. I Pompey am-

1
KING
YET. With libbard's head on knee.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. I Pompey am, Pompey surnam'd the Big-

1
KING
STARD. It is Great, sir.
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Great thanks, great Pompey.
  COSTARD. 
1

KING
THANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander;
  BOYET.

  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling
  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good
  NATHANIEL. 
1
KING
THANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander-

KING
LOFERNES. Not Iscariot, sir.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

1
KING
ROWNE. A kissing traitor. How art thou prov'd Judas?

1
KING
LOFERNES. Judas I am-

1
KING
MAIN. The more shame for you, Judas!
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. What mean you, sir?
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. To make Judas hang himself.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. Begin, sir; you are my elder.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
  HOLOFERNES. 
1
KING
LOFERNES. I will not be put out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. Because thou hast no face.

1
KING
LOFERNES. What is this?
  BOYET.

KING
LOFERNES. You have put me out of countenance.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING

KING
LOFERNES. But you have outfac'd them all.
  BEROWNE.

KING
YET. Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.

  BOYET.

  PRINCESS 
1
KING
INCESS OF FRANCE. Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!

1
KING
ROWNE. Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
  KING. 
1
KING
NG. Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. But is this Hector?
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
  LONGAVILLE. 
1
KING
NGAVILLE. His leg is too big for Hector's.
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. More calf, certain.
  BOYET. 
1
KING
YET. No; he is best indued in the small.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. This cannot be Hector.

NGAVILLE. I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against
  DUMAIN. 
1
KING
MAIN. Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, beat

KING
MADO. What meanest thou?
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench

1
KING
MADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. Then shall Hector be whipt for Jaquenetta that is quick by
  DUMAIN.

KING
MAIN. Most rare Pompey!

KING
ROWNE. Ay, if 'a have no more man's blood in his belly than will
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
  COSTARD. 
1
KING
STARD. I will not fight with a pole, like a Northern man; I'll

1
KING
MAIN. Room for the incensed Worthies!
  COSTARD.

KING
MAIN. Most resolute Pompey!
  MOTH.

KING
TH. Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my

1
KING
MAIN. You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
  BEROWNE. 
1
KING
ROWNE. What reason have you for 't?
  ARMADO. 
1
KING
MADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
