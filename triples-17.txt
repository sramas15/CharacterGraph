KING
0
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
LONGAVILLE
0
I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.
DUMAIN
0
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
BEROWNE
0
I can but say their protestation over;
KING
0
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
BEROWNE
0
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
LONGAVILLE
0
You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
BEROWNE
0
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
KING
0
Why, that to know which else we should not know.
BEROWNE
0
Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
KING
0
Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
BEROWNE
0
Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
KING
0
These be the stops that hinder study quite,
BEROWNE
0
Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain
KING
0
How well he's read, to reason against reading!
DUMAIN
0
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
LONGAVILLE
0
He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
BEROWNE
0
The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.
DUMAIN
0
How follows that?
BEROWNE
0
Fit in his place and time.
DUMAIN
0
In reason nothing.
BEROWNE
0
Something then in rhyme.
LONGAVILLE
0
Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
BEROWNE
0
Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
KING
0
Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.
BEROWNE
0
No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;
KING
0
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
BEROWNE

[Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of

Four days ago.
BEROWNE

Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her
LONGAVILLE
0
Marry, that did I.
BEROWNE
0
Sweet lord, and why?
LONGAVILLE
0
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
BEROWNE
0
A dangerous law against gentility.
KING
0
What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
BEROWNE
0
So study evermore is over-shot.
KING
0
We must of force dispense with this decree;
BEROWNE
0
Necessity will make us all forsworn
KING
0
Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
BEROWNE
0
Armado is a most illustrious wight,
LONGAVILLE
0
Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
DULL
0
Which is the Duke's own person?
BEROWNE
0
This, fellow. What wouldst?
DULL
0
I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's
BEROWNE
0
This is he.
DULL
0
Signior Arme- Arme- commends you. There's villainy abroad;
COSTARD
0
Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
KING
0
A letter from the magnificent Armado.
BEROWNE
0
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
LONGAVILLE
0
A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!
BEROWNE
0
To hear, or forbear hearing?
LONGAVILLE
0
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to
BEROWNE
0
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
COSTARD
0
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
BEROWNE
0
In what manner?
COSTARD
0
In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was
BEROWNE
0
For the following, sir?
COSTARD
0
As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the

Will you hear this letter with attention?
BEROWNE

As we would hear an oracle.
COSTARD

Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

Not a word of Costard yet.

It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling

Be to me, and every man that dares not fight!

No words!

Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

This is not so well as I look'd for, but the best that
KING
0
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to
COSTARD
0
Sir, I confess the wench.
KING
0
Did you hear the proclamation?
COSTARD
0
I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the
KING

It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a
COSTARD
0
I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.
KING
0
Well, it was proclaimed damsel.
COSTARD
0
This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.
KING
0
It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.
COSTARD
0
If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.
KING
0
This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir.
COSTARD
0
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
KING
0
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week
COSTARD
0
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
KING
0
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
BEROWNE
0
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat
COSTARD
0
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken
ARMADO
0
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
MOTH
0
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
ARMADO
0
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH
0
No, no; O Lord, sir, no!
ARMADO
0
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender
MOTH
0
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.
ARMADO
0
Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
MOTH
0
Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
ARMADO
0
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
MOTH
0
And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old
ARMADO
0
Pretty and apt.
MOTH
0
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and
ARMADO
0
Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH
0
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
ARMADO
0
And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH
0
Speak you this in my praise, master?
ARMADO
0
In thy condign praise.
MOTH
0
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
ARMADO
0
that an eel is ingenious?
MOTH
0
That an eel is quick.
ARMADO
0
I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.
MOTH
0
I am answer'd, sir.
ARMADO
0
I love not to be cross'd.
MOTH
0
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.
ARMADO
0
I have promised to study three years with the Duke.
MOTH
0
You may do it in an hour, sir.
ARMADO
0
Impossible.
MOTH
0
How many is one thrice told?
ARMADO
0
I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
MOTH
0
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
ARMADO
0
I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete
MOTH
0
Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace
ARMADO
0
It doth amount to one more than two.
MOTH
0
Which the base vulgar do call three.
ARMADO
0
True.
MOTH
0
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three
ARMADO
0
A most fine figure!
MOTH
0
[Aside] To prove you a cipher.
ARMADO
0
I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
MOTH
0
Hercules, master.
ARMADO
0
Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;
MOTH
0
Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great
ARMADO
0
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
MOTH
0
A woman, master.
ARMADO
0
Of what complexion?
MOTH
0
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the
ARMADO
0
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
MOTH
0
Of the sea-water green, sir.
ARMADO
0
Is that one of the four complexions?
MOTH
0
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
ARMADO
0
Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
MOTH
0
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
ARMADO
0
My love is most immaculate white and red.
MOTH
0
Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such
ARMADO
0
Define, define, well-educated infant.
MOTH
0
My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!
ARMADO
0
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
MOTH
0
     If she be made of white and red,
ARMADO
0
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
MOTH
0
The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
ARMADO
0
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
MOTH
0
[Aside] To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.
ARMADO
0
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
MOTH
0
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
ARMADO
0
I say, sing.
MOTH
0
Forbear till this company be past.
DULL
0
Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and
ARMADO
0
I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
JAQUENETTA
0
Man!
ARMADO
0
I will visit thee at the lodge.
JAQUENETTA
0
That's hereby.
ARMADO
0
I know where it is situate.
JAQUENETTA
0
Lord, how wise you are!
ARMADO
0
I will tell thee wonders.
JAQUENETTA
0
With that face?
ARMADO
0
I love thee.
JAQUENETTA
0
So I heard you say.
ARMADO
0
And so, farewell.
JAQUENETTA
0
Fair weather after you!
DULL
0
Come, Jaquenetta, away.             Exit with JAQUENETTA
ARMADO
0
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
COSTARD
0
Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full
ARMADO
0
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
COSTARD
0
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but
ARMADO
0
Take away this villain; shut him up.
MOTH
0
Come, you transgressing slave, away.
COSTARD
0
Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.
MOTH
0
No, sir; that were fast, and loose. Thou shalt to prison.
COSTARD
0
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I
MOTH
0
What shall some see?
COSTARD
0
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is

Proud of employment, willingly I go.

All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.

Now, what admittance, lord?

Navarre had notice of your fair approach,

Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I

You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

I will be welcome then; conduct me thither.

Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath-

Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.
KING

BOYET
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1

Why, will shall break it; will, and nothing

Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

BOYET
YOU Will the sooner that I were away,

Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
KATHARINE
1
BOYET
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
I know you did.
KATHARINE
1
BOYET
How needless was it then to ask the question!
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
You must not be so quick.
KATHARINE
1
BOYET
'Tis long of you, that spur me with such questions.
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
KATHARINE
1
BOYET
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
BEROWNE

What time o' day?
KATHARINE

The hour that fools should ask.
BEROWNE

Now fair befall your mask!

Fair fall the face it covers!
BEROWNE

And send you many lovers!
KATHARINE

Amen, so you be none.
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
Nay, then will I be gone.
KING

BOYET
Madam, your father here doth intimate
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BOYET
You do the King my father too much wrong,
KING

I do protest I never heard of it;
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
BOYET
We arrest your word.
KING
1
BOYET
Satisfy me so.
BOYET

So please your Grace, the packet is not come,

It shall suffice me; at which interview

Sweet health and fair desires consort your

Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
ROSALINE

BOYET
Pray you, do my commendations;
BEROWNE

I would you heard it groan.
ROSALINE
1
BOYET
Is the fool sick?
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
Sick at the heart.
ROSALINE

BOYET
Alack, let it blood.
BEROWNE
1
BOYET
Would that do it good?
ROSALINE

BOYET
My physic says 'ay.'
BEROWNE

Will YOU prick't with your eye?
ROSALINE

No point, with my knife.

Now, God save thy life!

And yours from long living!

I cannot stay thanksgiving.                [Retiring]
DUMAIN

BOYET
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
BOYET
1
BOYET
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
DUMAIN
1
BOYET
A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.          Exit
LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
BOYET
1
BOYET
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
BOYET
1
BOYET
She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
BOYET
1
BOYET
Her mother's, I have heard.
LONGAVILLE
1
BOYET
God's blessing on your beard!

BOYET
Good sir, be not offended;

Nay, my choler is ended.
BOYET

Not unlike, sir; that may be.           Exit LONGAVILLE
BEROWNE
0
What's her name in the cap?
BOYET
0
Rosaline, by good hap.
BEROWNE
0
Is she wedded or no?
BOYET
0
To her will, sir, or so.
BEROWNE
0
You are welcome, sir; adieu!
BOYET
0
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;

And every jest but a word.

It was well done of you to take him at his

I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
KATHARINE

Two hot sheeps, marry!
BOYET

And wherefore not ships?
KATHARINE

You sheep and I pasture- shall that finish the jest?
BOYET
0
So you grant pasture for me.     [Offering to kiss her]
KATHARINE
0
Not so, gentle beast;
BOYET
0
Belonging to whom?
KATHARINE
0
To my fortunes and me.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
BOYET

If my observation, which very seldom lies,
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
With what?
BOYET
0
With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Your reason?
BOYET
0
Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.
BOYET
0
But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd;
MARIA
0
Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.
KATHARINE
0
He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.
ROSALINE

Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but
BOYET

Do you hear, my mad wenches?
MARIA
0
No.
BOYET
0
What, then; do you see?
MARIA
0
Ay, our way to be gone.
BOYET
0
You are too hard for me.                         Exeunt
ARMADO

Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ARMADO

Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give
MOTH
0
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
ARMADO
0
How meanest thou? Brawling in French?
MOTH
0
No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue's
ARMADO
0
How hast thou purchased this experience?
MOTH
0
By my penny of observation.
ARMADO
0
But O- but O-
MOTH
0
The hobby-horse is forgot.
ARMADO
0
Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
MOTH
0
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love
ARMADO
0
Almost I had.
MOTH
0
Negligent student! learn her by heart.
ARMADO
0
By heart and in heart, boy.
MOTH
0
And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.
ARMADO
0
What wilt thou prove?
MOTH
0
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the
ARMADO
0
I am all these three.
MOTH
0
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
ARMADO
0
Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
MOTH
0
A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an
ARMADO
0
Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
MOTH
0
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is
ARMADO
0
The way is but short; away.
MOTH
0
As swift as lead, sir.
ARMADO
0
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
MOTH
0
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
ARMADO
0
I say lead is slow.
MOTH
0
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
ARMADO
0
Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
MOTH
0
Thump, then, and I flee.                            Exit
ARMADO
0
A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
ARMADO
1
MOTH
A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
    By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face;
    Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
    My herald is return'd.
MOTH
1
MOTH
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
ARMADO
1
MOTH
Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
COSTARD
1
MOTH
No egma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir.
ARMADO
1
MOTH
By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
MOTH
1
MOTH
Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
ARMADO
1
MOTH
No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
MOTH
1
MOTH
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
ARMADO
1
MOTH
 The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
MOTH
1
MOTH
   Until the goose came out of door,
ARMADO
1
MOTH
 Until the goose came out of door,
MOTH
1
MOTH
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
COSTARD
1
MOTH
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
ARMADO
1
MOTH
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
MOTH
1
MOTH
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
COSTARD
1
MOTH
True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in;
ARMADO
1
MOTH
But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
MOTH
1
MOTH
I will tell you sensibly.
COSTARD
1
MOTH
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth; I will speak that
ARMADO
1
MOTH
We will talk no more of this matter.
COSTARD
1
MOTH
Till there be more matter in the shin.
ARMADO
1
MOTH
Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
COSTARD
1
MOTH
O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some
ARMADO
1
MOTH
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
COSTARD
1
MOTH
True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me
ARMADO
1
MOTH
I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in
MOTH
1
MOTH
Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
COSTARD
1
MOTH
My sweet ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew!
BEROWNE
0
My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met!
COSTARD
0
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for
BEROWNE
0
What is a remuneration?
COSTARD
0
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
BEROWNE
0
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
COSTARD
0
I thank your worship. God be wi' you!
BEROWNE
0
Stay, slave; I must employ thee.
COSTARD
0
When would you have it done, sir?
BEROWNE
0
This afternoon.
COSTARD
0
Well, I will do it, sir; fare you well.
BEROWNE
0
Thou knowest not what it is.
COSTARD

Why, villain, thou must know first.

I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot,

Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.

What, what? First praise me, and again say no?
FORESTER
0
Yes, madam, fair.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Nay, never paint me now;
FORESTER
0
Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
See, see, my beauty will be sav'd by merit.
BOYET
0
Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Only for praise; and praise we may afford
BOYET
0
Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
COSTARD
0
God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that
COSTARD
0
Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

The thickest and the tallest.
COSTARD
0
The thickest and the tallest! It is so; truth is truth.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
What's your will, sir? What's your will?
COSTARD
0
I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
O, thy letter, thy letter! He's a good friend
BOYET
0
I am bound to serve.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
We will read it, I swear.
BOYET

[Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible;

What plume of feathers is he that indited this

I am much deceived but I remember the style.

This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;

Thou fellow, a word.

I told you: my lord.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
To whom shouldst thou give it?
COSTARD
0
From my lord to my lady.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
From which lord to which lady?
COSTARD
0
From my Lord Berowne, a good master of mine,
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords,
BOYET
0
Who is the shooter? who is the shooter?
ROSALINE
0
Shall I teach you to know?
BOYET
0
Ay, my continent of beauty.
ROSALINE
0
Why, she that bears the bow.
BOYET
0
My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
ROSALINE
0
Well then, I am the shooter.
BOYET
0
And who is your deer?
ROSALINE
0
If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
MARIA
0
You Still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the
BOYET
0
But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now?
ROSALINE
0
Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man
BOYET
0
So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when
ROSALINE

[Singing]
BOYET
0
   An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
COSTARD
0
By my troth, most pleasant! How both did fit it!
MARIA
0
A mark marvellous well shot; for they both did hit it.
BOYET
0
A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
MARIA
0
Wide o' the bow-hand! I' faith, your hand is out.
COSTARD
0
Indeed, 'a must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the
BOYET
0
An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
COSTARD
0
Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
MARIA
0
Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
COSTARD
0
She's too hard for you at pricks, sir; challenge her to

I fear too much rubbing; good-night, my good owl.

In love, I hope; sweet fellowship in shame!
BEROWNE

One drunkard loves another of the name.
LONGAVILLE

Am I the first that have been perjur'd so?
BEROWNE

I could put thee in comfort: not by two that I know;
LONGAVILLE

I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.
BEROWNE

O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:

This same shall go.          [He reads the sonnet]

Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted.

An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

As upright as the cedar.

Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

How now! What is in you? Why dost thou tear it?

A toy, my liege, a toy! Your Grace needs not fear it.

It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear

It is Berowne's writing, and here is his name.

Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!

What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

'Did they?' quoth you. Who sees the heavenly Rosaline
KING

What zeal, what fury hath inspir'd thee now?
BEROWNE

My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.
KING

By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
BEROWNE
0
Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
KING
0
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
BEROWNE
0
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
DUMAIN
0
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
LONGAVILLE

And since her time are colliers counted bright.

And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

Your mistresses dare never come in rain

Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,

O vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies

But what of this? Are we not all in love?
BEROWNE
0
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
KING

Then leave this chat; and, good Berowne, now prove
DUMAIN
0
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
LONGAVILLE
0
O, some authority how to proceed;

Some salve for perjury.

'Tis more than need.

Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!

Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;

PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
ROSALINE
0
Madam, came nothing else along with that?
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
ROSALINE
0
That was the way to make his godhead wax;
KATHARINE
0
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
ROSALINE
0
You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
KATHARINE
0
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
ROSALINE
0
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
KATHARINE
0
A light condition in a beauty dark.
ROSALINE
0
We need more light to find your meaning out.
KATHARINE
0
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
ROSALINE
0
Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
KATHARINE
0
So do not you; for you are a light wench.
ROSALINE
0
Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
KATHARINE
0
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
ROSALINE
0
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
ROSALINE
0
I would you knew.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Anything like?
ROSALINE
0
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
KATHARINE
0
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
ROSALINE
0
Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor,
KATHARINE
0
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
KATHARINE
0
Madam, this glove.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Did he not send you twain?
KATHARINE
0
Yes, madam; and, moreover,
MARIA
0
This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
MARIA
0
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
ROSALINE

They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

None are so surely caught, when they are

O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her Grace?
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Thy news, Boyet?
BOYET
0
Prepare, madam, prepare!
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid! What are they
BOYET
0
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
But what, but what, come they to visit us?
BOYET
0
They do, they do, and are apparell'd thus,
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd,
ROSALINE
0
Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
KATHARINE
0
But, in this changing, what is your intent?
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
ROSALINE
0
But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
BOYET
0
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
BOYET
0
The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come.
MOTH
0
All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
BOYET
0
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
MOTH
0
A holy parcel of the fairest dames
BEROWNE
0
Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
MOTH
0
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!
BOYET
0
True; out indeed.
MOTH
0
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
BEROWNE
0
Once to behold, rogue.
MOTH
0
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your
BOYET
0
They will not answer to that epithet;
MOTH
0
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
BEROWNE
0
Is this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue.
ROSALINE
0
What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.
BOYET
0
What would you with the Princess?
BEROWNE
0
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
ROSALINE
0
What would they, say they?
BOYET
0
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
ROSALINE
0
Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
BOYET
0
She says you have it, and you may be gone.
KING
0
Say to her we have measur'd many miles
BOYET
0
They say that they have measur'd many a mile
ROSALINE
0
It is not so. Ask them how many inches
BOYET
0
If to come hither you have measur'd miles,
BEROWNE
0
Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
BOYET
0
She hears herself.
ROSALINE
0
How many weary steps
BEROWNE
0
We number nothing that we spend for you;
ROSALINE
0
My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
KING
0
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do.
ROSALINE
0
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
KING
0
Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
ROSALINE
0
Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it soon.
KING
0
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
ROSALINE
0
You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
KING
0
Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man.
ROSALINE
0
Our ears vouchsafe it.
KING
0
But your legs should do it.
ROSALINE
0
Since you are strangers, and come here by chance,
KING
0
Why take we hands then?
ROSALINE
0
Only to part friends.
KING
0
More measure of this measure; be not nice.
ROSALINE
0
We can afford no more at such a price.
KING
0
Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
ROSALINE
0
Your absence only.
KING
0
That can never be.
ROSALINE
0
Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
KING
0
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,

Seventh sweet, adieu!
BEROWNE

One word in secret.

Let it not be sweet.

Thou grievest my gall.

Gall! bitter.

Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

Fair lady-

Say you so? Fair lord-
DUMAIN

Please it you,
KATHARINE
0
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
LONGAVILLE
0
I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
KATHARINE
0
O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
LONGAVILLE
0
You have a double tongue within your mask,
KATHARINE
0
'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
LONGAVILLE
0
A calf, fair lady!
KATHARINE
0
No, a fair lord calf.
LONGAVILLE
0
Let's part the word.
KATHARINE
0
No, I'll not be your half.
LONGAVILLE

Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
KATHARINE

Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
LONGAVILLE

One word in private with you ere I die.
KATHARINE

Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.

Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
BOYET

Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
ROSALINE

Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
ROSALINE

They were all in lamentable cases!
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
0
Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
MARIA

Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
KATHARINE

Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart;

Qualm, perhaps.
KATHARINE

Yes, in good faith.

Go, sickness as thou art!
ROSALINE

Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.

Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:

They will, they will, God knows,

All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
KING

Construe my speeches better, if you may.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
KING
1
KING
We came to visit you, and purpose now
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow:
KING
1

Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

You nickname virtue: vice you should have

O, you have liv'd in desolation here,

Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;

How, madam! Russians!
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
Ay, in truth, my lord;
ROSALINE
1
KING
Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.
BEROWNE
1
KING
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
ROSALINE
1
KING
This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
BEROWNE
1
KING
I am a fool, and full of poverty.
ROSALINE
1
KING
But that you take what doth to you belong,
BEROWNE
1
KING
O, I am yours, and all that I possess.
ROSALINE
1
KING
All the fool mine?
BEROWNE
1
KING
I cannot give you less.
ROSALINE
1
KING
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
BEROWNE
1
KING
Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
ROSALINE
1
KING
There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
KING
1
KING
We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.
DUMAIN
1
KING
Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?
ROSALINE
1
KING
Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
BEROWNE
1
KING
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
ROSALINE
1
KING
Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
BEROWNE
1
KING
Yet I have a trick
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
BEROWNE
1
KING
Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
ROSALINE
1
KING
It is not so; for how can this be true,
BEROWNE
1
KING
Peace; for I will not have to do with you.
ROSALINE
1
KING
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
BEROWNE
1
KING
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
KING
1
KING
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1
KING
The fairest is confession.
KING
1
KING
Madam, I was.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE
1

And were you well advis'd?
KING

I was, fair madam.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

When you then were here,

That more than all the world I did respect her.
PRINCESS OF FRANCE

When she shall challenge this, you will reject

Upon mine honour, no.

Peace, peace, forbear;

Despise me when I break this oath of mine.

I will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,

What, are there but three?
COSTARD

No, sir; but it is vara fine,

And three times thrice is nine.
COSTARD

Not so, sir; under correction, sir,

Is not nine.
COSTARD

Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.

Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.

Judas I am-

The more shame for you, Judas!
HOLOFERNES

KING
What mean you, sir?
BOYET

To make Judas hang himself.
HOLOFERNES

Begin, sir; you are my elder.
BEROWNE
1
KING
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
HOLOFERNES
1
KING
I will not be put out of countenance.
BEROWNE

Because thou hast no face.

Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now,
HOLOFERNES

You have put me out of countenance.
BEROWNE
1

False: we have given thee faces.
HOLOFERNES

But you have outfac'd them all.

Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.

Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.

Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
BOYET

But is this Hector?
DUMAIN

I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
LONGAVILLE

His leg is too big for Hector's.

More calf, certain.

No; he is best indued in the small.
