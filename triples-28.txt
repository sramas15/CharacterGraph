    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by

    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no

    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL

    And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
    Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire,
    Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
    Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
    For every trifle are they set upon me;
    Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,
    And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which
    Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount
    Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
    All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
    Do hiss me into madness.

    sing i' th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one,
    looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If
    it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to
    hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by
    pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
    alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
    fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A
    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
    thunderbolt.  [Thunder]  Alas, the storm is come again! My
    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no
    other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with
    strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs
    of the storm be past.

    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]

                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,

    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by

    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no

    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,

    hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by
    pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
    alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
    fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A
    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
    thunderbolt.  [Thunder]  Alas, the storm is come again! My
    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no

    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL

    hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by
    pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
    alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
    fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A
    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
    thunderbolt.  [Thunder]  Alas, the storm is come again! My
    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no
    other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with

    groves;
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL

    it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to
    hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by
    pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
    alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
    fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A
    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
    thunderbolt.  [Thunder]  Alas, the storm is come again! My
    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no
    other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with
    strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs
    of the storm be past.

    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd

    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,

    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]

    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them

RANDA. What is't? a spirit?
  PROSPERO. 
0
OSPERO. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
  MIRANDA.

RANDA. I might call him
  PROSPERO.

  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. He receives comfort like cold porridge.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. The visitor will not give him o'er so.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Sir-
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. One-Tell.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. A dollar.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Therefore, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. I prithee, spare.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Well, I have done; but yet-
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. He will be talking.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. The old cock.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. The cock'rel.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Done. The wager?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. A laughter.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. A match!
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. So, you're paid.
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Yet-
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. Yet-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. He could not miss't.
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Temperance was a delicate wench.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Here is everything advantageous to life.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. True; save means to live.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Of that there's none, or little.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. The ground indeed is tawny.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. With an eye of green in't.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. He misses not much.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. As many vouch'd rarities are.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Not since widow Dido's time.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
  ADRIAN. 
0
RIAN. Carthage?
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. I assure you, Carthage.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. His word is more than the miraculous harp.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. What impossible matter will he make easy next?
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. I think he will carry this island home in his
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Ay.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Why, in good time.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And the rarest that e'er came there.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. That 'sort' was well fish'd for.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. You cram these words into mine ears against
  FRANCISCO. 
0
ANCISCO. Sir, he may live;
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. No, no, he's gone.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. So is the dear'st o' th' loss.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. My lord Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Very well.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And most chirurgeonly.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Foul weather?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Very foul.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Or docks, or mallows.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. And were the king on't, what would I do?
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Scape being drunk for want of wine.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Yet he would be king on't.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. All things in common nature should produce
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. No marrying 'mong his subjects?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. I would with such perfection govern, sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Save his Majesty!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Long live Gonzalo!
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. And-do you mark me, sir?
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. 'Twas you we laugh'd at.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. What a blow was there given!
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. An it had not fall'n flat-long.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Go sleep, and hear us.
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Please you, sir,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. We two, my lord,
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Thank you-wondrous heavy!
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. It is the quality o' th' climate.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Why
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. What, art thou waking?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Do you not hear me speak?
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. I do; and surely
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Noble Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Thou dost snore distinctly;
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I am more serious than my custom; you
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Well, I am standing water.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. I'll teach you how to flow.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Do so: to ebb,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. O,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Prithee say on.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Thus, sir:
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. I have no hope
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. O, out of that 'no hope'
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. He's gone.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Then tell me,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Claribel.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. What stuff is this! How say you?
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. A space whose ev'ry cubit
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Methinks I do.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. And how does your content
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. I remember
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. True.
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. But, for your conscience-
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Thy case, dear friend,
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Draw together;
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. O, but one word.                  [They talk apart]
  ARIEL. 
0
IEL. My master through his art foresees the danger
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. Then let us both be sudden.
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Now, good angels
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. What's the matter?
  SEBASTIAN. 
0
BASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. I heard nothing.
  ANTONIO. 
0
TONIO. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo?
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Lead off this ground; and let's make further
  GONZALO. 
0
NZALO. Heavens keep him from these beasts!
  ALONSO. 
0
ONSO. Lead away.
  ARIEL. 
0
IEL. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done;
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. All the infections that the sun sucks up
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. I shall no more to sea, to sea,
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Do not torment me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. The spirit torments me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. I should know that voice; it should be-but he is
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Stephano!
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth; I'll pull
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke.
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN.  [Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be not
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. How didst thou scape? How cam'st thou hither?
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Here; swear then how thou escap'dst.
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO.  [Passing the bottle]  Here, kiss the book. Though
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. O Stephano, hast any more of this?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. The whole butt, man; my cellar is in a rock by
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My

0
EPHANO. Come, swear to that; kiss the book. I will
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. By this good light, this is a very shallow
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Come on, then; down, and swear.
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Come, kiss.
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. But that the poor monster's in drink. An
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. I prithee now, lead the way without any more
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN.  [Sings drunkenly]  Farewell, master; farewell,
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. A howling monster; a drunken monster!
  CALIBAN.

LIBAN. No more dams I'll make for fish;
  STEPHANO.

EPHANO. O brave monster! Lead the way.                Exeunt

  FERDINAND. 
0
RDINAND. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
  MIRANDA.

RANDA. Miranda-O my father,
  FERDINAND. 
0
RDINAND. Admir'd Miranda!
  MIRANDA.

RANDA. I do not know
  FERDINAND. 
0
RDINAND. I am, in my condition,
  MIRANDA. 
0
RANDA. Do you love me?
  FERDINAND.

RDINAND. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
  MIRANDA.

RANDA. I am a fool
  PROSPERO.

OSPERO.  [Aside]  Fair encounter
  FERDINAND.

RDINAND. Wherefore weep you?
  MIRANDA.

RANDA. At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
  FERDINAND.

RDINAND. My mistress, dearest;
  MIRANDA. 
0
RANDA. My husband, then?
  FERDINAND. 
0
RDINAND. Ay, with a heart as willing
  MIRANDA.

RANDA. And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
  FERDINAND.

RDINAND. A thousand thousand!
  PROSPERO.

EPHANO. Tell not me-when the butt is out we will drink
  TRINCULO.

INCULO. Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee; thy
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Where should they be set else? He were a brave
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs, and
  STEPHANO.

EPHANO. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest
  CALIBAN.

LIBAN. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
  CALIBAN.

LIBAN. Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head; if
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas'd to
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Marry will I; kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant,
  ARIEL. 
0
IEL. Thou liest.
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale,
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Why, I said nothing.
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. That's most certain.
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. How now shall this be compass'd? Canst thou
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Yea, yea, my lord; I'll yield him thee asleep,
  ARIEL. 
0
IEL. Thou liest; thou canst not.
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Didst thou not say he lied?
  ARIEL. 
0
IEL. Thou liest.
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Do I so? Take thou that.  [Beats him]  As you like
  TRINCULO. 
0
INCULO. I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Ha, ha, ha!
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Now, forward with your tale.-Prithee stand
  CALIBAN. 
0
LIBAN. Beat him enough; after a little time, I'll beat
  STEPHANO. 
0
EPHANO. Stand farther. Come, proceed.
  CALIBAN.

LIBAN. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him
  STEPHANO.

EPHANO. Is it so brave a lass?

OSPERO. Now I arise.                    [Puts on his mantle]
  MIRANDA. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you,
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Know thus far forth:
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Hast thou, spirit,
  ARIEL.

BOATSWAIN

IEL. To every article.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. My brave spirit!

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Close by, my master.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. But are they, Ariel, safe?
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Not a hair perish'd;
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Of the King's ship,
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Safely in harbour
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Ariel, thy charge
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Past the mid season.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. How now, moody?
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. My liberty.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Before the time be out? No more!
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. I prithee,
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Dost thou forget
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. No.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Thou dost; and think'st it much to tread the ooze
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. I do not, sir.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. No, sir.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Thou hast. Where was she born?
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Sir, in Argier.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. O, was she so? I must
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. O, was she so? I must
    Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
    Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
    For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Ay, sir.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child,
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Yes, Caliban her son.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. I thank thee, master.
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Pardon, master;
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Do so; and after two days
  ARIEL. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. That's my noble master!
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea; be subject
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea; be subject
    To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
    To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,
    And hither come in 't. Go, hence with diligence!
                                                      Exit ARIEL

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. The strangeness of your story put
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Shake it off. Come on,
  MIRANDA. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. 'Tis a villain, sir,
  PROSPERO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. But as 'tis,
  CALIBAN.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN.   [ Within]  There's wood enough within.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Come forth, I say; there's other business for thee.
    Come, thou tortoise! when?
  ARIEL.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. My lord, it shall be done.                         Exit
  PROSPERO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I must eat my dinner.
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Thou most lying slave,

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. O ho, O ho! Would't had been done.
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Abhorred slave,

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. You taught me language, and my profit on't

ARIEL

ARIEL

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Where should this music be? I' th' air or th'
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. What is't? a spirit?
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. I might call him
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  It goes on, I see,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Most sure, the goddess
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. No wonder, sir;
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. My language? Heavens!
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. How? the best?
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Alack, for mercy!
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  The Duke of Milan
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Why speaks my father so ungently? This
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. O, if a virgin,
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Soft, Sir! one word more.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No, as I am a man.
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Follow me.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No;
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. O dear father,
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. What, I say,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Beseech you, father!
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Hence! Hang not on my garments.
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Sir, have pity;
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Silence! One word more
  MIRANDA.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. My affections

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Come on; obey.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. So they are;

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  It works.  [To FERDINAND]  Come on.-
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Be of comfort;
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [To FERDINAND]  Come, follow.  [To MIRANDA]
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He receives comfort like cold porridge.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The visitor will not give him o'er so.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Sir-
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. One-Tell.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A dollar.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Therefore, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. I prithee, spare.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Well, I have done; but yet-
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He will be talking.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. The old cock.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The cock'rel.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Done. The wager?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. A laughter.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A match!
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. So, you're paid.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Yet-
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Yet-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He could not miss't.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Temperance was a delicate wench.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Here is everything advantageous to life.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. True; save means to live.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Of that there's none, or little.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The ground indeed is tawny.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. With an eye of green in't.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He misses not much.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. As many vouch'd rarities are.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Not since widow Dido's time.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Carthage?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I assure you, Carthage.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. His word is more than the miraculous harp.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. What impossible matter will he make easy next?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I think he will carry this island home in his
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Ay.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Why, in good time.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And the rarest that e'er came there.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. That 'sort' was well fish'd for.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. You cram these words into mine ears against
  FRANCISCO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ANCISCO. Sir, he may live;
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. No, no, he's gone.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. So is the dear'st o' th' loss.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. My lord Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Very well.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And most chirurgeonly.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Foul weather?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Very foul.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Or docks, or mallows.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. And were the king on't, what would I do?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Scape being drunk for want of wine.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Yet he would be king on't.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. All things in common nature should produce
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. No marrying 'mong his subjects?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I would with such perfection govern, sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Save his Majesty!
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Long live Gonzalo!
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. And-do you mark me, sir?
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. 'Twas you we laugh'd at.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. It is the quality o' th' climate.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Why
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What, art thou waking?
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Do you not hear me speak?
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I do; and surely

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Noble Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Thou dost snore distinctly;
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. I am more serious than my custom; you
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Well, I am standing water.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. I'll teach you how to flow.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Do so: to ebb,

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O,

2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Prithee say on.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Thus, sir:
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I have no hope
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, out of that 'no hope'
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He's gone.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Then tell me,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Claribel.
  ANTONIO.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What stuff is this! How say you?
  ANTONIO.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. A space whose ev'ry cubit

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Methinks I do.
  ANTONIO.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And how does your content

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I remember

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. True.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,

BASTIAN. O, but one word.                  [They talk apart]
  ARIEL.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. My master through his art foresees the danger

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. What's the matter?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. I heard nothing.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Lead off this ground; and let's make further
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

  ALONSO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Lead away.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. All the infections that the sun sucks up
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. I shall no more to sea, to sea,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Do not torment me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. The spirit torments me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I should know that voice; it should be-but he is
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Stephano!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth; I'll pull
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN.  [Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be not
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. How didst thou scape? How cam'st thou hither?
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Here; swear then how thou escap'dst.
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO.  [Passing the bottle]  Here, kiss the book. Though
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. O Stephano, hast any more of this?
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. The whole butt, man; my cellar is in a rock by
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come, swear to that; kiss the book. I will
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. By this good light, this is a very shallow
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come on, then; down, and swear.
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come, kiss.
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. But that the poor monster's in drink. An
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. I prithee now, lead the way without any more
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN.  [Sings drunkenly]  Farewell, master; farewell,
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. A howling monster; a drunken monster!
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. No more dams I'll make for fish;
  STEPHANO.

ARIEL

EPHANO. O brave monster! Lead the way.                Exeunt
  FERDINAND.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. There be some sports are painful, and their

3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Alas, now; pray you,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. O most dear mistress,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. If you'll sit down,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No, precious creature;
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. It would become me
  PROSPERO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  Poor worm, thou art infected!
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. You look wearily.
  FERDINAND.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
  MIRANDA.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Miranda-O my father,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Admir'd Miranda!
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. I do not know
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. I am, in my condition,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Do you love me?
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. I am a fool
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  Fair encounter
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Wherefore weep you?
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. My mistress, dearest;
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. My husband, then?
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Ay, with a heart as willing
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. A thousand thousand!
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. A thousand thousand!

  PROSPERO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. So glad of this as they I cannot be,
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Tell not me-when the butt is out we will drink
  TRINCULO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They
  STEPHANO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee; thy
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Where should they be set else? He were a brave
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
  TRINCULO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs, and
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
  TRINCULO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my
  TRINCULO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head; if

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas'd to

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Marry will I; kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant,
  ARIEL.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Thou liest.
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale,
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Why, I said nothing.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I say, by sorcery he got this isle;

3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. That's most certain.
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. How now shall this be compass'd? Canst thou
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Yea, yea, my lord; I'll yield him thee asleep,
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Thou liest; thou canst not.
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Didst thou not say he lied?
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Thou liest.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Do I so? Take thou that.  [Beats him]  As you like
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Ha, ha, ha!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Now, forward with your tale.-Prithee stand
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Beat him enough; after a little time, I'll beat
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Stand farther. Come, proceed.
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Is it so brave a lass?
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,
  STEPHANO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Monster, I will kill this man; his daughter and I

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Excellent.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Give me thy hand; I am sorry I beat thee; but

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. This will I tell my master.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Thou mak'st me merry; I am full of pleasure.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. That's not the tune.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. What is this same?
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. This is the tune of our catch, play'd by the
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy
  TRINCULO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A living drollery. Now I will believe

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
TONIO. I'll be thy second.      Exeunt SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

  FERDINAND.

  MIRANDA.

ARIEL

ARIEL

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
    Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
    Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
    And as with age his body uglier grows,
    So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
    Even to roaring.
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not

2
ARIEL

INCULO. Thou wert but a lost monster.
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll

ARIEL

2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Do, do. We steal by line and level, an't like
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. I will have none on't. We shall lose our time,
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Monster, lay-to your fingers; help to bear this
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. And this.
  STEPHANO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Hark, they roar.
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Now does my project gather to a head;
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I did say so,
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Confin'd together
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Dost thou think so, spirit?
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Mine would, sir, were I human.
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. And mine shall.
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. I'll fetch them, sir.                              Exit
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
    groves;
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
  ARIEL. 
1
BOATSWAIN
IEL. I drink the air before me, and return
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement,
  PROSPERO.

BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Behold, Sir King,
  ALONSO.

BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Whe'er thou be'st he or no,
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. First, noble friend,
  GONZALO.

BOATSWAIN
NZALO. Whether this be
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. You do yet taste
  SEBASTIAN. 
1
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN.  [Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. No.
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. If thou beest Prospero,
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I am woe for't, sir.
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Irreparable is the loss; and patience
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I rather think
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. You the like loss!
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. As great to me as late; and, supportable
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. A daughter!
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
  MIRANDA. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RANDA. Sweet lord, you play me false.
  FERDINAND. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RDINAND. No, my dearest love,
  MIRANDA. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RANDA. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. If this prove
  SEBASTIAN. 
1
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. A most high miracle!
  FERDINAND. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RDINAND. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Now all the blessings
  MIRANDA. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RANDA. O, wonder!
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. 'Tis new to thee.
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
  FERDINAND. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RDINAND. Sir, she is mortal;
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. I am hers.
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. There, sir, stop;
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. I have inly wept,
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO.  [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your
  GONZALO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. Be it so. Amen!
  BOATSWAIN.

ARIEL

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO.  [Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. These are not natural events; they strengthen
  BOATSWAIN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ATSWAIN. If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL.  [Aside to PROSPERO]  Was't well done?
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Sir, my liege,

1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Sir, my liege,
    Do not infest your mind with beating on
    The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure,
    Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
    Which to you shall seem probable, of every

    And think of each thing well.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man

  SEBASTIAN.

ARIEL

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. I shall be pinch'd to death.
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. He is drunk now; where had he wine?
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. And Trinculo is reeling ripe; where should they
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. Why, how now, Stephano!
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a

2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I should have been a sore one, then.
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO.  [Pointing to CALIBAN]  This is as strange a thing
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. He is as disproportioned in his manners

ARIEL

ARIEL

BOATSWAIN
NZALO. I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks
    he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
    perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging;
    make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth
    little advantage. If he be not born to be hang'd, our

  MIRANDA. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. But that I do not.
  PROSPERO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A dollar.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A match!

3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. So, you're paid.
  ADRIAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He could not miss't.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
  ANTONIO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly

3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Here is everything advantageous to life.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

SEBASTIAN
NZALO. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The ground indeed is tawny.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. With an eye of green in't.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He misses not much.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. As many vouch'd rarities are.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Not since widow Dido's time.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Carthage?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I assure you, Carthage.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. His word is more than the miraculous harp.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. What impossible matter will he make easy next?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I think he will carry this island home in his
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Ay.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Why, in good time.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And the rarest that e'er came there.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. That 'sort' was well fish'd for.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. You cram these words into mine ears against
  FRANCISCO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ANCISCO. Sir, he may live;
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. No, no, he's gone.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. So is the dear'st o' th' loss.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. My lord Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Very well.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And most chirurgeonly.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Foul weather?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Very foul.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Or docks, or mallows.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. And were the king on't, what would I do?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Scape being drunk for want of wine.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Yet he would be king on't.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. All things in common nature should produce
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. No marrying 'mong his subjects?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I would with such perfection govern, sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Save his Majesty!
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Long live Gonzalo!
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. And-do you mark me, sir?
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. 'Twas you we laugh'd at.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. What a blow was there given!
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. An it had not fall'n flat-long.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Go sleep, and hear us.
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Please you, sir,
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. We two, my lord,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Thank you-wondrous heavy!
  ALONSO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Thank you-wondrous heavy!
                                     [ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. It is the quality o' th' climate.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Why
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What, art thou waking?
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Do you not hear me speak?
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I do; and surely
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Noble Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Thou dost snore distinctly;
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. I am more serious than my custom; you
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Well, I am standing water.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. I'll teach you how to flow.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Do so: to ebb,
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Prithee say on.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Thus, sir:
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I have no hope
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, out of that 'no hope'
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He's gone.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Then tell me,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Claribel.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What stuff is this! How say you?
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. A space whose ev'ry cubit
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Methinks I do.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And how does your content
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I remember
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. True.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. But, for your conscience-
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Thy case, dear friend,
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Draw together;
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. O, but one word.                  [They talk apart]
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. My master through his art foresees the danger
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Then let us both be sudden.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Now, good angels
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. What's the matter?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. I heard nothing.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Lead off this ground; and let's make further
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Heavens keep him from these beasts!
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Lead away.
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done;
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. All the infections that the sun sucks up
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. I shall no more to sea, to sea,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Do not torment me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. The spirit torments me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I should know that voice; it should be-but he is
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Stephano!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth; I'll pull
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN.  [Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be not
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. How didst thou scape? How cam'st thou hither?
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Here; swear then how thou escap'dst.
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO.  [Passing the bottle]  Here, kiss the book. Though
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. O Stephano, hast any more of this?
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. The whole butt, man; my cellar is in a rock by
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come, swear to that; kiss the book. I will
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. By this good light, this is a very shallow
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come on, then; down, and swear.
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come, kiss.
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. But that the poor monster's in drink. An
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. I prithee now, lead the way without any more
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN.  [Sings drunkenly]  Farewell, master; farewell,
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. A howling monster; a drunken monster!
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. No more dams I'll make for fish;
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. O brave monster! Lead the way.                Exeunt
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. There be some sports are painful, and their
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Alas, now; pray you,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. O most dear mistress,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. If you'll sit down,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No, precious creature;
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. It would become me
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  Poor worm, thou art infected!
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. You look wearily.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Miranda-O my father,
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Admir'd Miranda!
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. I do not know
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. I am, in my condition,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Do you love me?
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. I am a fool
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  Fair encounter
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Wherefore weep you?
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. My mistress, dearest;
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. My husband, then?
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Ay, with a heart as willing
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. A thousand thousand!
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. A thousand thousand!
                          Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. So glad of this as they I cannot be,
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Tell not me-when the butt is out we will drink
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee; thy
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Where should they be set else? He were a brave
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

SEBASTIAN

3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. What is this same?

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er
  CALIBAN. 
2

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not

ARIEL

ARIEL

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN

  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
    groves;
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
  ARIEL.

BOATSWAIN
IEL. I drink the air before me, and return
  GONZALO.

OSPERO.  [Aside]  It goes on, I see,
  FERDINAND.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Most sure, the goddess
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. No wonder, sir;
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. My language? Heavens!
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. How? the best?
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Alack, for mercy!
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  The Duke of Milan
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Why speaks my father so ungently? This
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. O, if a virgin,
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Soft, Sir! one word more.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No, as I am a man.
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Follow me.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. No;
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. O dear father,
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. What, I say,
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Beseech you, father!
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Hence! Hang not on my garments.
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Sir, have pity;
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Silence! One word more
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. My affections
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO. Come on; obey.
  FERDINAND. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RDINAND. So they are;
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [Aside]  It works.  [To FERDINAND]  Come on.-
  MIRANDA. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RANDA. Be of comfort;
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [To ARIEL]  Thou shalt be as free
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. To th' syllable.
  PROSPERO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
OSPERO.  [To FERDINAND]  Come, follow.  [To MIRANDA]
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He receives comfort like cold porridge.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The visitor will not give him o'er so.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Sir-
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. One-Tell.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A dollar.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Therefore, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. I prithee, spare.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Well, I have done; but yet-
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He will be talking.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. The old cock.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The cock'rel.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Done. The wager?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. A laughter.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. A match!
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Ha, ha, ha!
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. So, you're paid.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Yet-
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Yet-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He could not miss't.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Temperance was a delicate wench.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Here is everything advantageous to life.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. True; save means to live.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Of that there's none, or little.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The ground indeed is tawny.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. With an eye of green in't.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He misses not much.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. As many vouch'd rarities are.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Not since widow Dido's time.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
  ADRIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
RIAN. Carthage?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I assure you, Carthage.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. His word is more than the miraculous harp.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. What impossible matter will he make easy next?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I think he will carry this island home in his
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Ay.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Why, in good time.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And the rarest that e'er came there.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. That 'sort' was well fish'd for.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. You cram these words into mine ears against
  FRANCISCO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ANCISCO. Sir, he may live;
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. No, no, he's gone.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, peace.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. So is the dear'st o' th' loss.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. My lord Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Very well.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And most chirurgeonly.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Foul weather?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Very foul.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Or docks, or mallows.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. And were the king on't, what would I do?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Scape being drunk for want of wine.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Yet he would be king on't.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. All things in common nature should produce
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. No marrying 'mong his subjects?
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I would with such perfection govern, sir,
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Save his Majesty!
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Long live Gonzalo!
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. And-do you mark me, sir?
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. 'Twas you we laugh'd at.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. What a blow was there given!
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. An it had not fall'n flat-long.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Go sleep, and hear us.
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Please you, sir,
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. We two, my lord,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Thank you-wondrous heavy!
  ALONSO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Thank you-wondrous heavy!
                                     [ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. It is the quality o' th' climate.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Why
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What, art thou waking?
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Do you not hear me speak?
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I do; and surely
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Noble Sebastian,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Thou dost snore distinctly;
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. I am more serious than my custom; you
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Well, I am standing water.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. I'll teach you how to flow.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Do so: to ebb,
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Prithee say on.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Thus, sir:
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I have no hope
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, out of that 'no hope'
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. He's gone.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Then tell me,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Claribel.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. What stuff is this! How say you?
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. A space whose ev'ry cubit
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Methinks I do.
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. And how does your content
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. I remember
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. True.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. But, for your conscience-
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Thy case, dear friend,
  ANTONIO. 
2
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Draw together;
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. O, but one word.                  [They talk apart]
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. My master through his art foresees the danger
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. Then let us both be sudden.
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Now, good angels
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. What's the matter?
  SEBASTIAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
BASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. I heard nothing.
  ANTONIO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
TONIO. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo?
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Lead off this ground; and let's make further
  GONZALO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
NZALO. Heavens keep him from these beasts!
  ALONSO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
ONSO. Lead away.
  ARIEL. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
IEL. Prospero my lord shall know what I have done;
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. All the infections that the sun sucks up
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. I shall no more to sea, to sea,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Do not torment me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. The spirit torments me. O!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the
  CALIBAN. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. I should know that voice; it should be-but he is
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Stephano!
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!
  TRINCULO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
INCULO. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and
  STEPHANO. 
3

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.
  STEPHANO.

BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. Stand farther. Come, proceed.
  CALIBAN.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
LIBAN. That's not the tune.
  STEPHANO. 
3
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN
EPHANO. What is this same?
  TRINCULO.

ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
SEBASTIAN

INCULO. Monster, I do smell all horse-piss at which my
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Thou wert but a lost monster.
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Thy Grace shall have it.
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Do, do. We steal by line and level, an't like
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. I will have none on't. We shall lose our time,
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Monster, lay-to your fingers; help to bear this
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. And this.
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Ay, and this.
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Hey, Mountain, hey!
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Silver! there it goes, Silver!
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Hark, they roar.
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Now does my project gather to a head;
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I did say so,
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Confin'd together
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Dost thou think so, spirit?
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. Mine would, sir, were I human.
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. And mine shall.
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL. I'll fetch them, sir.                              Exit
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
    groves;
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]
            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with
          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN
           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which
          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which
                    PROSPERO observing, speaks
    A solemn air, and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
  ARIEL. 
1
BOATSWAIN
IEL. I drink the air before me, and return
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement,
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Behold, Sir King,
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Whe'er thou be'st he or no,
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. First, noble friend,
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. Whether this be
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. You do yet taste
  SEBASTIAN. 
1
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN.  [Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. No.
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. If thou beest Prospero,
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I am woe for't, sir.
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Irreparable is the loss; and patience
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I rather think
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. You the like loss!
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. As great to me as late; and, supportable
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. A daughter!
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
  MIRANDA. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RANDA. Sweet lord, you play me false.
  FERDINAND. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RDINAND. No, my dearest love,
  MIRANDA. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RANDA. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. If this prove
  SEBASTIAN. 
1
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. A most high miracle!
  FERDINAND. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RDINAND. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Now all the blessings
  MIRANDA. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RANDA. O, wonder!
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. 'Tis new to thee.
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
  FERDINAND. 
1
BOATSWAIN
RDINAND. Sir, she is mortal;
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. I am hers.
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. There, sir, stop;
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. I have inly wept,
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
  GONZALO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
  ALONSO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
ONSO.  [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your
  GONZALO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
NZALO. Be it so. Amen!
  BOATSWAIN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ATSWAIN. The best news is that we have safely found
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL.  [Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO.  [Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. These are not natural events; they strengthen
  BOATSWAIN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ATSWAIN. If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
  ARIEL. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
IEL.  [Aside to PROSPERO]  Was't well done?
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Sir, my liege,
  PROSPERO. 
1
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Sir, my liege,
    Do not infest your mind with beating on
    The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure,
    Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
    Which to you shall seem probable, of every
    These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
    And think of each thing well.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come
    hither, spirit;
    Set Caliban and his companions free;
    Untie the spell.  [Exit ARIEL]  How fares my gracious sir?
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Sir, my liege,
    Do not infest your mind with beating on
    The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure,
    Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
    Which to you shall seem probable, of every
    These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
    And think of each thing well.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come
    hither, spirit;
    Set Caliban and his companions free;
    Untie the spell.  [Exit ARIEL]  How fares my gracious sir?
    There are yet missing of your company
    Some few odd lads that you remember not.
  TRINCULO, 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO, in their stolen apparel
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. Ha, ha!
  ANTONIO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
TONIO. Very like; one of them
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. I shall be pinch'd to death.
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. He is drunk now; where had he wine?
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. And Trinculo is reeling ripe; where should they
  TRINCULO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
INCULO. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. Why, how now, Stephano!
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?
  STEPHANO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
EPHANO. I should have been a sore one, then.
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO.  [Pointing to CALIBAN]  This is as strange a thing
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. He is as disproportioned in his manners
  CALIBAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
LIBAN. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter,
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Go to; away!
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. Or stole it, rather.
  SEBASTIAN. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
BASTIAN. Or stole it, rather.
                          Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. Sir, I invite your Highness and your train
  ALONSO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
ONSO. I long
  PROSPERO. 
2
ARIEL
BOATSWAIN
OSPERO. I'll deliver all;
